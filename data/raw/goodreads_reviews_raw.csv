6743601,Jim Fonseca,"This book is as much about art as it is a historical novel.. First the novel. A tale of miniaturist painters in Istanbul during the late 1500’s. The deceased master’s daughter is in a religious and political limbo: her soldier husband has been missing for four years, but with no body and no witnesses to his death, she can’t get a divorce and move on with her life. She wants to find a new husband and a father for her two young boys and get away from the amorous intentions of her husband’s brother. And there's a murder mystery.. Enter a man called Black, an administrator of sorts who has returned to town after twelve years in distant lands. He still carries a torch for the beautiful widow from his days as a youth. Can he find her father’s killer, keep the brother-in-law at bay, help her get a legal divorce, and win her hand in marriage? Along the way we have blended into the text what are really mini-essays about horses; dogs in the Koran: what it’s like to be a murderer; Satan; the path of a counterfeit coin, etc.. At least half of this lengthy work is about art. (I say lengthy because the 500-page paperback I read was tiny type, so this is a 700- or 800- page book in normal font.) Miniaturist painting was imported into the Ottoman Empire from Persia. Most of the painting was done as pictures in books and to illustrate the borders of pages of books, accompanied by elaborate calligraphy. (Think of the Irish monks’ manuscripts such as the Book of Kells.). Ottoman miniaturist painting was highly stylized. Pictures were drawn from the viewpoint of Allah, from the top of a minaret, and did not use what the West thinks of as true perspective. Armies lined up symmetrically in battle scenes; horses always had the same foreleg raised; a finger placed in a mouth always represented surprise. In accordance with religious concerns about idolatry, faces were generic, not individualized. Who would dare place an identifiable individual at the center of a painting? Man can copy; only Allah can create. The painter tried to portray the ideal horse or chair as Allah created it (think Plato’s “ideal chair”), not the individual variant before them. Is individuality expressed by a traditional miniaturist painter “style” or a “flaw?” Does it offend God?. Compare all this to the European masters at the time such as da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael (the Turks called them “the Venetians”). So a lot of the book is about East meets West in the art world. All in all, an excellent book from the Nobel Prize-winning Pamuk. The story kept my interest and I enjoyed learning about Ottoman art, even when the sections where the miniaturists talked about the philosophy behind painting got repetitive at times.","May 04, 2016"

216890,Darcy,"Generally, when a book starts out with a chapter entitled ""I Am A Corpse,"" you know it's going to be pretty good.. The novel is set up so that each chapter introduces a different narrator, including (but not limited to), Black, Black's uncle, Shekure, a dog, a horse, the murderer and various artists in the workshop. This type of structure for a mystery novel isn't new--Wilkie Collins, for example, employed it several times, most notably in The Moonstone--and it is an effective way to structure a story so as to hide the whodunit. Each character only tells as much as he, she or it knows and in Pamuk's novel even the murderer hides his or her identity.. The structure in ""My Name Is Red,"" though is less designed to sustain suspense and more to allow room for the various philosophical discussions concerning the purpose of art and, perhaps more importantly, the distinctions between Islamic states and Western Europe. The Frankish mode of painting, particularly of portraiture--to glorify the subject, to paint him or her in terms of his/her earthly wealth and power, to distribute such an image openly as a show of control, to demonstrate the creative abilities of the artist--is at the center of these debates and discussions. Black's uncle finds such images alluring and fascinating while others see them as abhorent. Master Osman, for example, sees himself as being forced to choose between the centuries old Islamic traditions he venerates and the more modern and distinctly foreign style he despises. Such a choice is not made easily, as the artists themselves discover. The Frankish method celebrates the individuation of the artist--it prizes the signature of the artist as much as the commissioner of the image. This reverence for the artist, as much as for the piece of art, proves to be a great temptation to the men involved and leads directly to the murder.. The structure, however, also allows for a second discussion, not about art but about writing on art. As much as this is a novel concerning visual images, it is also a novel about ekphrasis--the verbal description of art. Ekphrasis has the effect of slowing down a narrative, of interrupting it. Thus, in Homer's Illiad, the great battle scene is suddenly punctured by a lengthy description of Achilles' shield. Pamuk plays with this model repeatedly. When the image of the horse, described several times in the novel, is given a voice of its own the narrative is not interrupted, but rather the description of the image becomes the narrative. And, moreover, as the image speaks it refutes the fundamental principles underlying Master Osman's devotion to Islamic traditions of art. Pamuk can hardly resist the joke--this is a novel about art in which not a single image appears, except the map at the beginning and the ones we create in our minds as we imagine the images described. But, are we creating an image of the ideal horse, the horse of God, or one we can actually touch, taste, and smell?","Jul 24, 2007"

48483884,Michael Finocchiaro,"This is a fantastic book by Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk which explores the relationship between art and religion ad between imagery and idolatry. Set in the 16th century, we are transported into an Istanbul of the Ottoman empire with a murder mystery told in the voices of the characters (and sometimes these are drawings in the books or just concepts) that inhabit the story. Its primary characters feel very real and the buildup to the big reveal at the end makes the book a real page turner. I think that the story told here is still more than relevant to our world of today given the problems stemming from reading religious texts word for word and building violent systems of repression or terror based on individual interpretations of those readings. Unfortunately, some things have not evolved enough in the last 400 years...A must read.","Aug 23, 2016"

6237864,Nandakishore Varma,"I am in two minds about this book.. Obviously, it is an important work. It showcases the miniaturist tradition of the Islamic world, and uses the cloistered world of miniaturists to explore the difference in philosophies between the East and the West. It was all the more interesting to me because I have been fascinated by this difference ever since I began viewing paintings with serious interest. In the East, ""perspective"" does not exist: the painting flows seamlessy over space and time whereas in the West (especially since the Renaissance) the painting is the reproduction of a particular moment in time (we are not talking of abstractions here). The miniaturist paints the world as God sees it: he does not sign the painting, nor does he have an individual style, because he is unimportant. He continues painting (in fact, he paints better!) after he inevitably goes blind. The Frankish painters, in contrast, paint the world as we see it, which is blasphemy according to some of the miniaturists.. I was captivated by the sweep of the book as well as the way it was presented: short chapters, each from the viewpoint of a different character, as though we were looking at a book of miniatures which tells a different story on each page. Moreover, it is a murder mystery in which the victims as well as the murderer directly speak to the reader! It bears a certain resemblance to ""The Name of the Rose"" in this regard, although Eco's book is much more powerful according to me.. Coming to the minuses: the writing is cumbersome and a task to wade through. I do not know if this is a problem with Pamuk's writing or the translation. The characters are flat: the protagonist (Black) is too weak and cowardly: the heroine (if we can call her that!) too self-centred and manipulative. Maybe the author intended them to be like that, but it does lose reader interest.. I was also rather put off by the amount of lust bubbling on each page. Apart from normal sex (including homosexuality), there is incest, paedophilia, bestiality, fetishism... simmering just beneath the surface. Young boys are regularly presented as objects of lust. Men kiss each other passionately, even when one is about to kill the other! I have heard that Turkey was the centre of ""deviant"" sexual practices during Ottoman times, so maybe it is a true picture, but it did not vibe with me.. (Edit to add: a person has commented that this paragraph is likely to give the impression that I am attacking LGBTQ people, and on reading it again, I find that there is some substance to the accusation. So I have edited it suitably. The whole idea of putting ""deviant"" in quotes was to highlight the dubiousness of the label. However, it was the lust that disturbed me and not the sexual preference. Maybe it is my personal problem, that is why I have noted it down subjectively.). So...adding the negatives and positives, I will go for three stars.","Oct 20, 2011"
94602,Kelly,"My fickle heart longs for the West when I'm in the East and for the East when I'm in the West.. My other parts insist I be a woman when I'm a man and a man when I'm a woman.. How difficult it is being human, even worse is living a human's life.. I only want to amuse myself frontside and backside, to be Eastern and Western both.. This is Pamuk's enduring, never ending obsession. He's written fiction and non-fiction, journal articles and newspaper bites, and given endless interviews on this theme. He's even been thrown in jail and put on trial for the identity he has chosen. He's won the Nobel Prize in Literature for his commitment to expressing his deeply divided mind and spirit, and that (at least he and many others believe) of his country- Turkey. (I apologize in advance if this ends up being something of a ramble through the literary bramble, but I can only say that that would mirror the experience of reading this book.). My Name is Red. will tell you that it is a murder mystery, set in 16th century Istanbul, under the rule of the Sultan. But it will also tell you that it is about many other things, each of which changes, ephermerally, by the moment. The atmosphere of the story digs a little bit into Garcia-Marquez's garden, but storytelling would never be mistaken for his. Each chapter is told by a different voice- some of which are plausible members of a storytelling round, and some of which would really only belong in that category if you were on acid, but they all seem about equally credible, due to the fact that nobody is really credible, so one might as well be fiction or myth as fact. (For instance, we hear from the voices of the drawing of a horse, the fake voice of a woman who is actually a man, a gold piece and the color red.) It is ethereal, elusive, and there isn't one incarnation of the mind that can be trusted here. Don't fall into the trap of assuming that what you read has anything to do with anything other than the particular pyschology of the moment- Pamuk is a master of depicting the every day track of a mind, and how unreliable each feeling of a moment is- how everything important is changed by the fact that one just happens to feel hungry at a particular moment, or desperately horny at another. It is an absolute masterwork of insight on the psychology of a particular people at a particular time, and all the various reasons why they are that way, and yet he is able to make them as relatable as possible through it all.. What struck me the most throughout the entire book was how terrified, it seemed, that Pamuk was of missing something. While other authors might be striving to become masters of literature, masters of form, I think Pamuk wished that he could be nothing so much as a master of tapestry-making. I think he would die happy if he could have given this book to the theoretical Weaver in the sky and gotten it back as a divine scrap of worked fabric. There are lists upon lists upon lists of endless things that go on for pages, only to stop and start up once again. As a part of his contradictory feelings towards the West, in a culture whose stories and traditions often originated in the East... although he longs for the West, he's terrified, just as his characters are, that everything they know from the East will disappear. It seems like he can't stop himself- there's some sort of driving fear if he doesn't list everything about history and culture and myth, and repeat all the stories again and again to make sure we remember what they are, it will be gone forever. His expression of ambivalence towards Western culture perfectly expresses the mindset of illuminators in 16th century Istanbul terrified that their entire lives are about to become irrelevant.. The other absorbing, fascinating, and horrifying thing was how well Pamuk illustrates the idea that absolutely nobody speaks with their own voice, both through his painters, constrained by centuries of adherance to a perfect style that some random master brought out of Baghdad that depicts the ""perspective of Allah."" It is considered heresy and a fault to have a ""style"", and ""signatures"" are furitively hidden away as much as possible- the idea that blindness is the ideal to be obtained for these artists is just heartbreaking- at least to someone coming at it from a Western perspective, where seeing painters deliberately rob themselves of their sight, their most precious commodity, over and over again, in the course of obtaining a meaningless idea of perfection that is not their own. The murderer throughout this book strives endlessly to hide himself by speaking in a voice that does not at all resemble how we see him in other places. The majority of people who are speaking a themselves tell stories in order to express their feelings- in fact at the beginning all the suspected illuminators speak almost entirely in story form in order to answer any important question on any philosophical, religious, or even personal topic. Expressing one's feelings just isn't done. One doesn't go up to the pretty boy one would like to fuck and tell him so, one tells him a parable about a gorgeous boy in order to show your admiration for him. Much as the pictures are seen as the ""perspective of Allah,"" it seems that there is only one way to speak, too, in the ""words of Allah,"" or those stories which are sanctioned by the authorities as legitimate- the authority of Allah on earth. It was the ultimate tragedy of the book from the Western perspective, and the ultimate triumph of the book from the accepted ides of the time, all of these de-individualized people (as much as can be done or denied or pushed from sight) striving towards the goal of seeing as Allah does, ever in the correct way.. But everyone recognizes the end of the ""Eastern"" way of life coming from the West, in the guise of the ""Venetian"" ways that everyone will want to slavishly follow in the future, ways which reactionary preachers and religious people are protesting against before they've even made serious headway, trying to keep their way of life ""pure."" But the rest of the book poitns out again and again that there is no way that the culture of the Ottoman Empire was pure in any way- no constantly conquering culture with a large army and a long reach could ever be. No autocratic society that entailed artisans, craftsman and soldiers to pick up and serve someone else once their lord was defeated (if they weren't killed out right) could develop in isolation without any influence from the outside. He shows globalization already happening, back in the 16th century, and how deep the effects penetrate then and now.. I loved his. Istanbul. for his brilliant evocation of identity, living with a burdensome past and an uncertain future, for its poetry and its memory.. My Name is Red. accomplishes much the same thing, with more magic- but just enough dirt to bring it right straight home where it belongs in 2009.","Jul 15, 2009"
5431458,Henry Avila,"During nine snowy, cold, winter days in the fabulous city of Istanbul the capital of the Ottoman Empire, at its height in the reign of Sultan Murat 111 there occurred a brutal murder, (not the last one ) the year 1591. At the bottom of an abandoned well the mangled body of Elegant Effendi nicknamed Red, a miniaturist who had worked for the Sultan is found but not before the corpse tells his sad story. How the victim was lured by a person which was thought a close friend, with promises of riches and savagely attacked. Strangely the spirit is contented and feels no anger now. Just looking forward to the new world paradise, in heaven. He was a talented painter along with Stork, Olive, and Butterfly under old Master Osman who gave them all their aliases, taught the boys everything they know including beatings, when mistakes were made ( all surprisingly love their master, of 25 years) in a workshop funded by the revered sovereign. Colorful paintings of bright glorious colors of horses , trees, clouds, important people slaughter on many battlefields, fables, enchanting gardens under the exotic illuminating moon with lovers looking tenderly at each other . Red was uneasy about a secret project he worked on because of the foreign, Venetian styled illustrations forbidden by Islam many believe, later when completed these small paintings will be put in a book, to be viewed only by the ruler and a few trusted associates ... Black (Kara) a clerk, secretary, and occasional warrior hired by pashas fighting endless wars against the Persians, returns to his hometown of Istanbul after twelve long years. A failed romance cause him much suffering, the reason for his volunteered exile. The beauty Shekure his uncle's Enishte daughter, was constantly on his mind the lonely days spent thinking about his cousin wanderings through the vast hot deserts and freezing temperatures in the dizzy , elevations of towering mountains sleeping in pungent tents in isolated locations. The rejection of a marriage proposal by his own uncle for his love, and her wedding to another a famous soldier he can never forget. But her husband has been missing for four years, she with two small children living at her father's house and the army has come back. A second chance for happiness if only Black can win her affections... Still he has very strong competition, from fierce Hasan younger brother of Shekure's fearless husband. Esther a shrewd Jewish peddler, matchmaker , and messenger for clandestine sweethearts she knows everything about everyone, having walked over all the city's streets begins bringing letters to Shekure and Black and Hasan too. Rumors that the killer is a miniaturist sweeps the city. Black had been one in his youth, with the three remaining master painters before quitting. And the angry Sultan wants the murderer caught in three days, or torture will commence on the suspects every miniaturist ...","Dec 18, 2013"
5407952,Jibran,"Arguably the best novel of Orhan Pamuk. Set in Istanbul during the height of Ottoman power, this novel is a tribute to the art of painting as well as a fascinating murder mystery which will keep you hooked till the end. The unusual narrative is felt with full force right from the start - as you read the first chapter, starting with the voice of a corpse at the bottom of the well wondering who was the wretched man that killed him.. Then ensues a beautiful exploration of the 16th century Istanbul's art scene, its many rivalries, and in between breaths a heartfelt love story that keeps the main protagonist on his heels, as he finds his way through the internecine politics at home and at court. This story is a fascinating example of the possibilities of modern global novel. Must read.","Feb 24, 2014"

When a student of mine, aged 15, stormed into the library and declared this was the best book ever, I felt strangely sad I hadn't thought more about it since I read and loved it some years ago. When the same student grabbed the next Orhan Pamuk novel she could find on the shelf, an innocent brick of a museum novel, I even felt jealous, as I hadn't read that one yet and I bizarrely envied her the first touch of a Pamuk novel - while at the same time being incredibly grateful he writes and reaches the next generation. A rare gift. I remember developing a passion for miniature painting while reading My Name Is Red, and it has stayed with me since, even through the times when I barely remembered the book itself..

1036893,Fabian,"I could not help but think of the film ""Daisies"" (“Sedmikrasky,” dir. Vera Chytilova), that shameless classic of the Czech New Wave while reading Ohran Pamuk’s My Name is Red. That brilliant & psychedelic film of the 60’s portrays two incessant, silly girls who seem to want to emphasize their existence by playing pranks on other people and being undeniably obnoxious. They are terrified at the idea of being forgotten—of not existing. Similarly, in Pamuk’s epic novel of conspiring miniaturists, of love and death, the reader is confronted with the theme of existence. There is an unknown presence which strives to be part of the reader’s consciousness—which, like the two unremitting, adolescent & undeniably-alive individuals of the film, tries its hardest to appear, to become known & acknowledged.. My Name is Red has a radical structure. As I read more and more books, it becomes increasingly clear that some writers take an enormous amount of effort in establishing a frame, a “cabinet of curiosities” (in the same tradition as MVL’s “Chinese boxes” and “communicating vessels) in which to properly display their creations. For example, A. S. Byatt, in her Booker-prize winning novel ""Possession,"" a novel that is more poetry book than a novel, creates several frames in which to place all the poetry which two poets keep exchanging as tokens of their love. Byatt obviously wants to make her poetry accessible, and gives it further clout by giving each poet his or her unique voice—by fully creating two different minds. Pamuk also uses the novel to display his craft, establishing a museum in which to showcase his “paintings”: his cabinet of curiosities includes, not poems, but individual vignettes, brush-stroke tableaus which represent but one facet of a full universe. The conglomeration of these makes up the bulk—gives the reader the voice, the theme & style—of the novel.. “If I could only,” the nameless murderer tells Enishte Effendi, “see the last picture in its entirety” (158). Both the character’s expectations and the reader’s match—their journey is, therefore, genuinely entwined. The reader wants to know what all these different vignettes will culminate in. The wants of a fictional character and those of an actual live reader are the one and the same—this is the main catalyst which moves the narrative to its awesome conclusion. The reader is prepared to sift through the surplus of stories, images, and motifs to get to the bottom of this radical love story/murder mystery. Enishte Effendi admits: “They say we’ve committed an unforgivable sin by daring to draw, from the perspective of a mangy street dog, a horsefly and a mosque as if they were the same size” (158). Virginia Woolf’s literary sense of character democracy, of consciousness-equality, is pretty much Pamuk’s own. By depicting various POVs, by making them authentic and articulate, Pamuk seems to rationalize like many of the great writers that every tiny aspect of the plot is essential—only with all of these different takes on the same thing (the murder of Elegant and the love story of Black and Shekure) can the reader get a faithful interpretation of such enormous complexity and chaos.. There is a consciousness which ties the characters together, and it is perhaps the force of life itself. The crazy girls perturb the status quo when they admit that they want to live (live!) in Daisies. The different entities (whether they be annoying Shekure or the talking picture of a dog, or literally, the color red) all possess life and they indulge the reader in their personal and unique elucidations on life in 16th-century Istanbul. The added element, that is, all the writer’s own beliefs in art (writing is aptly compared to painting) are present in Red, and the work transcends not only the rules of storytelling by having such incredibly different characters in it with such unique voices, but also because it dabbles with the postmodern idea of reading about art within a work of art.. All that being said, there is a grave problem with the pacing of the book--it took me forever to complete this (and lets face it, Gone With the Wind this is not). Also, there is a ceaseless amount of repetition of events, a constant reassurance that seems extraneous-- a recompilation of different occurrences voiced by the different (though extremely intriguing) characters. The themes, rich in the context of the production of art, are very appropriate and very revolutionary. This is a postmodern work which of course still lingers on the romantic, and then plays around some with the detective novel genre.","Oct 01, 2012"
425220,Lissa,"I tried very hard to really like this book. But, I suppose it's impossible to succeed in everything.. My Name Is Red is both historical fiction and a murder mystery. It takes place in 1591 (according to the timeline at the end of the book). The over-arching motion of the plot centers around the death of a master miniturist in the Sultan's court. The death is revealed in the first chapter, though the reasons surrounding the his death are much slower in being revealed. What is known, almost at the outset, is that his death is related to a book that the Sultan has commission that is to be illustrated in the European style, with respect to perspective and a view of the world as an actual person sees it (as opposed to how Allah would see it). Enishte Effendi, the person in charge of the manuscript, calls his childhood apprentice Black Effendi back from Persia to Istanbul to help investigate the murder and help him finish the Sultan's book. Within this overarching plot is the plight of Enishte's daughter Shekure, whose husband went to war four years prior and never came back. Black has been pining away for her during his twelve year absence from Istanbul, though he is not the only man who is interested in becoming her new husband. Amongst the plot and subplot, there are multiple discussions of style and individualism and what it means to be a father/father-figure, among other topics.. The story is told in a sort of Faulkner-esque fashion, with each chapter being told in the perspective of different characters in the story. These characters are sometimes alive, and sometimes dead (as in the first chapter entitled ""I am a corpse""). Also, sometimes the chapters are told in the sort-of perspective of the drawing from Enishte's book - I say sort of, because they're really told from the perspective of a coffee house storyteller who is pretending to be what is depicted in Enishte's book. Are you confused yet?. The was my first issue with this book: at the beginning, it's very confusing. Not knowing a lot about the Muslim faith, it took many chapters before I figured out what exactly was wrong with the way Enishte wanted to illustrate his manuscript. My second problem with this book was all of the exposition. There is too much time spent on the exposition on topics like love and style that are obliquely connected with the plot. Certainly these expositions add greater depth to the different characters, but after a while it started to get a little tedious. Thirdly, Pamuk does not inhabit his different narrators in the way that David Mitchell (Ghostwritten, Cloud Atlas) manages to. As a result, the book feels a little bit flat. Fourthly, the subplot with Shekure adds very little to the book. I found her to be an incredibly unappealing character, and I found myself wishing that the murderer would murder her next.. All of that being said, the book does have a certain flair to the writing. Some of the exposition is really thought-provoking. I also thought that the stories told from the perspective of drawings and corpses and even colors were interesting additions to the plot. In sum, I'm not sorry I read it, but I was expecting more out of it.","Sep 26, 2007"
56939723,Samra Yusuf,"I believe in the fact that there is nothing as fact, everything the eye beholds is the individual reality of the beholder, what the eye sees and mind translates it as sight is a phenomenon of individual perception, and this is where the artist discerns himself from a mere beholder, he is, simultaneously a beholder and a creator, or we may say the re-creator, his strokes alive the scenery, his colors spark the stars, his art immortals the mortality of life, and his hands vouchsafe timelessness to the time bound. And such an artist, is a blatant sinner in the eyes of Islam, as Allah is the sole creator, and to create is his attribute only, and to impersonate this attribute an act of sacrilege! And Orhan took 700 plus pages to indispensably say this.. Its sixteenth century Istanbul, pinnacle of ottoman rule, a book of illustrations is in the making, the contents of the book are being kept secret until it completes, as the Sultan demands. One of the four makers of book is found murdered at the pit of well with cause of murder and murderer unknown, following another murder of the in charge of the whole work Enishte Effendi by the hands of same murderer in same manner, and a good 500 pages wrap the further happenings.. The novel’s busting with plots within plots, history, mystery, art, education, philosophy, love, lost, you just name it, and all it lacks is grip on reader and the inspiration to move on, or in the very least drag on, I believe Orhan is not the sole creator of this concoction of a thing novel, translator has done the job on equal ground, but translation alone doesn’t grind the gears, it’s the whirlwind of infinity narrative voices you find yourself blown up with, or we might correctly say swipe away with, characters are as flat as a scale, and never did I read anything this lackluster on the subject of art. I am inclined to believe all Pamuk aimed through this, was the encomium to the lost art of Islamic illumination, if it could only had not been with this dry voice..huh!","Dec 13, 2017"
1415047,Whitaker,"Some stories sink their teeth into your gut and don't let go. Others offer more cerebral pleasures (works by Borges comes to mind). This is more the second than the first, and I'm okay with that.. First and foremost, there are quite a few chapters in this book that read more like a chapter in a book on the history of Islamic illuminations than a chapter in a novel. In this respect, however, Pamuk can legitimately point to past antecedents in this vein: Tolstoy for one in. War and Peace. , Melville for another in. Moby Dick. . Me, I. liked. reading about the art of Islamic miniatures.. Secondly, and perhaps most crucially, this is. not. a novel about a crime set in the workshops of the Ottoman Sultan's miniaturists. Uh huh, I know what the blurb says. It's not. That's just the setting. The real jewel in the crown is the eulogy, the encomium to the lost art of Islamic illumination.. And that's what fired me up. That, and the fact that it's not. just. a novel about this fabulous lost art, it's a novel that seeks to. replicate. that art in the form of a novel and, by doing so, to bring us closer to understanding the tragedy of its loss.. Take a look at that picture above. It's an example of Islamic miniature art. Actually, it's an image of a great love story in Islamic literature. Look at it. And I mean REALLY look at it. See the contours of the man's face, the details of the landscape; notice the flatness and odd perspective of the scene; revel in the colours.. This image was produced and reproduced hundreds of thousands of times by different unknown artists in more or less the same way. This image was poured over by aficionados who would know the story by heart, who would even have memorized what the different elements making up the scene should look like.. This is not an image that can be taken in with a single cursory glance--""Oh pretty,"" you say, ""Next!"" That would be anathema to the ethos of the art. It wasn't even supposed to be a stand-alone image, but a decorative element in a book telling the story of the two lovers.. Look at that image. Not the story it tells, but the artistic elements, the ideas about the world embodied in it. That little piece of art is this book, and this book is that little piece of art. And when I finished the book, I mourned the loss of that art. Brilliant!","Aug 09, 2009"

8641338,Fiona,"It's a rare pleasure to read a book so richly layered. Contained within what is essentially a murder mystery is the history of Islamic art, miniaturists in particular, and its clash with European (Frankish) art in the late 15th/early 16th centuries, romance, a social history of Istanbul at that time, religious extremism, a seditious storyteller in a coffeehouse, Ottoman history, multiple parables and historic tales bathed in myth.. Pamuk tells the story through many different voices, each giving their perspective on events as they unfold and bizarrely including the murdered telling the tales of their own deaths. There was a point, probably 4/5ths of the way through, when the endless intricacies of Islamic representations of horses in particular began to pall (Dear Orhan, we get the message already!) but what I loved was the way in which the author makes us 'see' and think about this art form in its many different settings. He made me think quite deeply about visual artistry which is not something I'm prone to do very often (I'm too lazy).. I swithered whether to give this 4.5 or 5 stars. The translation of this edition is clunky. It's written in American English, e.g. the translator uses the word 'ornery' a lot which is meaningless on this side of the pond, and he uses abbreviations that a native speaker wouldn't ordinarily put into print, e.g. I'd've. I can't mark a book down for its translation though, just this edition. Although the descriptions of artworks were at times overly lengthy and the number of parables became a little bit tedious at times, I have to give it 5 stars simply because it is a luscious book overall and one that I have enjoyed losing myself in over the last few days.","Dec 30, 2016"
21432277,Supratim,"I had heard a lot of praises for My Name is Red by the Turkish author Orhan Pamuk and the book had been on my TBR for a long time before I finally got a chance to read it.. The story is set in the end of the sixteenth century in the city of Istanbul, the capital of the mighty Ottoman Empire. The Sultan of Turkey has commissioned a book in secret and one of the miniaturists working on the project is murdered. It won’t be the only murder of course!. miniaturist - A painter of miniatures or an illuminator of manuscripts. The main character of this novel is called Black. He had to drop out of a miniaturist workshop and leave Istanbul because he had the audacity to profess his life for his uncle’s daughter, Shekure. Anyway Black has finally returned and is still in love with Shekure, now a mother of two and whose husband went missing in a war.. There are rumours that the miniaturists, working under the supervision of Black’s uncle, had been imitating the styles of the “infidel” Franks in the secret book, and thus committing blasphemy.. The book has some elegant writing and the author has done an excellent job of fleshing out the complex characters. The narrative is also full of parables through which the characters would clarify and reinforce their beliefs on art and religious morality. The author has skillfully portrayed the various emotions and feelings of the humans – love, lust, fear, envy, bigotry,greed.. While reading this book, I couldn’t help comparing it with The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco. By coincidence, I had purchased these two books on the same day. Since I had read book by Eco very recently it was still somewhat fresh in my mind and I could see the similarities and dissimilarities as well. I later saw that many readers have compared the two books. Both the books are historical fictions with multiple murders, though based in different countries and cultures. The Name of the Rose is around the Christian beliefs whereas My Name is Red talks about the Islamic view around art. The former had long discussions on religious beliefs in general while the latter dwelled at length on the religious morality and its impact on art particularly illustration and painting.. The murders in both the novels revolved around books because some individuals considered the content to be blasphemous.. The Name of the Rose was narrated by a single person while there are multiple POVs in My Name is Red, the living or even the dead get to tell their story.. The story plotted by Eco mostly revolved around monks but Pamuk’s novel gave a voice to people from different sections of the society. There was a feeling of suffocation in The Name of the Rose (due to the strict atmosphere of an abbey), but in case of My Name is Red, though there was fear, I felt the feeling of suffocation was less intense – probably because it was set in the outside world where people talked about art and love.. The book was a novel experience for me for it was my first book about Turkey. I learnt a bit about a new culture – their history, beliefs, mythology and way of life.. I enjoyed reading the book, but at times the narrative dragged so much – I was getting bored with the love triangle involving Black, Shekure and Hasan, Shekure’s brother-in-law. The long discussions on the morality and integrity of Ottoman art, though well written, were getting tiresome.. If you want a fast paced crisp thriller, then this book is not for you. But, if you don’t mind a historical fiction with lots of pages devoted to art and beliefs, then you can give it a try.. I am giving the book a rating of 3.5! I have deducted 0.5 because the narrative dragged so much at times.","Sep 09, 2018"
140255,Leslie,"Saying I liked it or didn't like it doesn't really capture the complexity of my experience with this book. Part murder mystery, part love story, and part historical novel about the book-art in the ottoman empire....I thought it was right up my alley. Maybe I expected to have more of an emotional connection but it was all very intellectual and somehow that frustrated me...churned up my stomach which was quite contented on the diet of all-fluff, all-the-time. Reading this was like eating roasted beets with rosemary---good for me but i prefer something sweeter, and smoother.. OK, here's my beef:. It often felt like reading a genealogy of islamic stories and historical books which I found tiring; though sitting in the vault of the sultan and perusing these books would be incredible for me, reading about the rich visual imagery was tedious.. I constantly felt like there was something I couldn't access because I don't have the specific background knowledge; but I still can't even form the questions I need for deeper connection. I had the impression that the stories recounted over and over would be mundane (in a comforting way), familiar and meaningful for people from that culture they weren't for me.. The murder mystery kept me reading because I wanted to find out who did it but resentfully, because i kept losing track of the author's clues while trudging through the endless philosophizing.. The conversations about the place of art and artists in relation to their funders, influences, and the contemporary culture; the ways representation can be slippery and dangerous; the questions surrounding seeing, perception, blindness, and divine inspiration vs. a skillful hack job--- all of these are fascinating and relevant to me but such a dry dry dry voice.. And the love story was pffff... like looking through a snow globe at some scenery you couldn't touch.","Aug 02, 2007"
5237420,Ana ,"It's not often you find books that start with the speech of an already dead character. It's actually pretty damn rare to find dead bodies speaking at all, wouldn't you agree? Well, Pamuk apparently didn't get the memo. Because that is exactly how his wonderful work, ""My Name is Red"", starts.. The body of ""Elegant"" Effendi is rotting in a well, somewhere in Istanbul. During life, he was a miniaturist, an artistry that is usually found in Ottoman books, and his talent was known as one of the best of his days, hence the nick-name ""Elegant"". His carcass, decaying in its crumpled position on the bottom of that well, tells the reader that he has been murdered, and demands that his killer be found. He dreams of the tortures that the one who ended his life will suffer. A four-days old mort dreams of vengeance.... The next thing you notice in the book is that every chapter is constructed around a single, individual character. This means that the reader's perspective resembles that of a God, looking through different sets of eyes at the same image. This over-seeing that you are burdened with in the beginning becomes a kind of judging position, as you, as a passive by-stander, are integrated in the story. You slowly become the one who is looking for the murderer. You have three that might be killer-fabric: Olive, Butterfly and and Stork. At one point, one of them deceives himself through his unique painting style. Also, the human characters are not the only ones who speak through the chapters; Death itself talks about how she roams the streets of Istanbul, a tree drawn by a miniaturist tells the story of his creation, a coin of their time talks about its journey through many pockets etc. Through the ""lifeless"" characters of this work, you understand not only the art of miniaturists (with the help of the tree drawing), but the whole world itself, the setting in which you are bound to live for as long as you read Pamuk's writing.. I think there are three major lines in this book: the quest to find Elegant Effendi's murderer, the love story between Black and Shekure and the creation of a book that Black was commissioned to do.. Black is a miniaturist and a binder, who just returned to Istanbul after 12 years as a free worker in different realms of our world. He is, at the moment of the story, 36 years old, but is also presented as a young 24 year old man who fell in love with the then 12-year-old Shekure, daughter of Black's uncle, Enishte Efendi. Even after 12 years spent away, even if her face might have faded from his mind, Black understands that the love of his life is her and that he is capable of doing anything to have Shekure next to him. Nothing is an impediment in his quest: even the fact that she is already married seems to be just a minor problem on their way. He sets out to win her, and is in the process taken under the wing of her father, Enishte Efendi, who tells him that he has to work on an ample book of pictures celebrating the magnificent world that they live in, but in the ""Frank"" style, which is what they would call European figurative painting.. This is where the story of the book intertwines with the story of the two characters' love, because if he wants Shekure, Black must finish the book.. Because of the Islam religion, figurative art is considered a blasphemy, as, and I quote: ""Islam allows to portray a picture as Allah sees it to be"". In the setting of this book, which is Istanbul of 1591, a year before the 1000th anniversary of the Hegire (Mohammed's exile from Mecca to Medina), Ottoman culture seems to have been changed by this individual approach to art. They are not permitted to create things as they see them, but rather as they should ideally and hypotethically be seen by their God, Allah. This European style that Black and others have to work in is a blasphemous act, therefore it was done in the utmost secrecy, always in fear that they should be discovered. It is this particular action that shows how culture can be changed by introducing a new viewpoint in art - this time, in painting.. Speaking of painting: this whole book is probably one of the most competent explanations of how art, and especially miniaturist painting here, evolved. It talks about how it is the most important possible work, as it lasts through centuries and shows people what their history looked like. It talks about the miniaturist's blessing and curse, becoming blind towards the end of his life, when he can paint more beautifully than ever, because he sees through the eyes of his mind, of his soul. A detail therefore, becomes the image and the image becomes the detail, as they are so intertwined that you can't separate them. And still, with all the mighty human painters, time is this art's master. A lot of detail work has been put into this book, and the magnitude of the descriptions is rarely to be found in writing, these days. Like Mo Yan, Pamuk deserves his 2006 Nobel Prize; his unique style is a light seam through the cloth of life, culture, humanity, heart, mind and soul of Creation, and he writes beautifully about what he thinks is important.. And there are so many moments in this book that are pure joy for the attentive reader! It sometimes touches on how love might be a curse, a rope around the lover's neck, obliging him to thread lightly on silky footsteps around this dangerous animal of a feeling, and it sometimes talks about love as if it is the noblest of the feelings and the only paradise that man can aspire at. ""My Name is Red"" touches on problems of marriage and sexual frustration and the dehumanization of the sexual act, how it can be just a mindless, void moment, rather than an union between two beings who love each other. It debates religion, spirituality, cultural identity, death, infinity and so many more other themes that most of the writers are not capable of even integrating in their work, let alone attempt to explain them.. Another recommendation made by my History teacher, yet another one I thank him for. Cheers!","Feb 19, 2014"
257105,Ayu Palar,"‘To God belongs the East and the West’ – Al-Qur’an, Al Baqarah ayat 115.. I had abandoned. My Name is Red. for how long I can’t remember. The brilliance of it was untouched, what a shame. But after reading. Other Colours. (an amazing essay collection also by Orhan Pamuk), I thought I should give Mr. Pamuk another shot, and boy, how much I enjoyed the novel! And I understand why Pamuk deserves the Nobel prize. He’s the kind of writer that can bring out the cultural richness but at the same time using it to promote world peace.. My Name is Red. is a brightly rich novel. The main plot is a murder mystery of a miniaturist in Turkey, but what makes this novel is different is that Pamuk mixes it with other interesting elements: a passionate love story, devotion to art and the cultural clash between the East and the West. At first, I didn’t think the love story was significant enough, but well, it turns out the love conflict has an important role for the ending.. Still not interesting enough for you? Well, let’s see. Inspired by Virginia Woolf, Pamuk loves to make an unusual plotline. The story is delivered through many points of view. Not only the humans, Pamuk also gives voices to unliving things, like a gold coin and a corpse. In fact, it is the corpse that opens the story of the novel. Now you won’t call it ordinary, eh? Pamuk even gives a chance for the murderer to say something. This technique might tire some readers, however it provides the thriller until the end.. The thing that kinda bothers me is that the last chapter of Shekure. I personally think the chapter isn’t too strong to close the novel. If I were Pamuk, I would close it by using Master Osman’s point of view. I’d like to know what his reaction is after knowing who the killer is. But all in all,. My Name is Red. is a splendid work of art. I just hope no one will make a film of it. I truly believe it won’t capture the magnificence of this novel.","Oct 24, 2008"
4693,Ali,"It’s not a historical, though there is sort of history in it (Istanbul, Ottoman Empire, 1591). The mystery death of two master miniaturists doesn’t make it a murder mystery novel either. It’s not a philosophical novel though there are lots of discussions about illusrtation in European style concerning perspective, and traditional Eastern illustrating, which sees the world in the way Allah would see it.. What amazed me is, how Pamuk has taken a now forbiden discussion, to 5 centuries back, to stablish a better situation to discuss about tabus, concerning the distinctions between Islamic states and Western Europe. It's how the so-called Islamic style of illuminating lost it’s values to the so-called Frankish mode of painting, painting the earthly wealth, rather than images of what God creates on earth. In another word, demonstrating the creative abilities of the artist (European style) which Enishte effendi finds fascinating is forbiden in Islam, as if it’s kind of competing with God in creation. That’s why some other master miniaturists kill him to not loose their stabilities and honour as artists. It means that those who are not seeing the realilty of life and human being (idealists) are going to loose their style and power. This describes the restrained violence of the culture clashes which are so relevant to our world at this time through the allegory of artistic expression as European manner of representing the world, and that of the Islamic faith, in the novel!. اگرچه وقایع داستان در دوران عثمانی (1591) می گذرد اما نمی شود گفت ""تاریخی""ست. جنایی هم نیست اگرچه وقایع حول و حوش دو قتل اتفاق می افتد. و اگرچه بحث، بیشتر در مقایسه ی دو شیوه ی هنری، مینیاتور جهان اسلام و نقاشی ونیزی یا مکتب فرانسوی ست، اما رمان در مورد فلسفه ی هنر هم نیست. یعنی نه آنقدر تاریخ در آن هست و نه فلسفه و نه جنایت. اهمیت اساسی در لایه ی دوم رمان است، همان گونه که در ""برف""، رمان دیگر پاموک. دغدغه ی فکری پاموک مساله ی جاری زمان ماست، مقایسه و تقابل جهان اسلام و سنت از یک سو و جهان غرب و مدرنیته در سوی دیگر. مساله ای که ذهن اغلب روشنفکران در جهان اسلام را به خود مشغول داشته. انتخاب دو شکل تصویر سازی در دو جهان، به دلیل فلسفه ای که در پس ساختار مینیاتور (یک بعدی بودن آن و پرهیز از خلق دوباره ی جهان) و هنر نقاشی غربی (دید سه بعدی هنرمند از جهان) وجود دارد، انتخاب بسیار ظریف و استادانه ای ست از سوی پاموک، برای نشان دادن تقابل میان دو گونه تفکر در جهان معاصر، یکی سنتی و اقتدارگرا و دیگری مدرن و دموکرات. یکی در فراموشی انسان در مقابل خدا و دیگری در اهمیت به انسان به عنوان هسته ی اصلی جامعه ی بشری. با انتخاب زمان تاریخی در گذشته، پاموک این فرصت را به خود داده تا در مورد بسیاری از ""تابوها""ی امروز در جوامع اسلامی، به راحتی و در کمال آزادی صحبت کند.","Sep 27, 2007"

6753400,Gabrielle,"Historical murder mystery and reflection on religion, love and death: Mr. Pamuk is pretty ambitious, telling us the story of a man who returns to Istanbul after twelve years away, and is asked to undertake a very dangerous work, reconnect with a lost love and solve the mystery of a man’s death. But this is not simply a very unusual “whodunit”; it’s a complex portrait of a great city at a moment of intense upheaval at the end of the 16th century. The East and the West were becoming reacquainted with each other culturally and commercially, challenging their mutual worldviews and values.. In the Ottoman Empire, representative art was forbidden for religious reasons. The Quran condemned the reproduction of a living being’s image as idol worship, and to glorify the subject of the painting, or the individuality of the artist, was a grievous sin. But since the very nature of an artist is to see the world slightly differently, not all of the painters and miniaturists of Istanbul agreed with the idea of purely abstract representation. Some have traveled to Italy, seen the work of foreign masters and begun to think of their work and their world differently. But some deeply religious people will continue to think of representative art as sacrilege, no matter who commissions the work…. “My Name is Red” is built like one of the mosaics described in the story: like vignettes that would be meaningless by themselves, but that make a rich and grand picture once they are assembled. Each chapter is narrated by a different character; some that we encounter over and over again, and others that we only see once. This gives you a kaleidoscopic view of the story and while the execution is not perfect (and I’m not sure how much of that can be chalked up to translation), it is still a damn impressive literary device! And the little meta-wink at the end was a very nice touch!. The constantly changing POV can be a bit confusing. Again, maybe the original Turkish text was clearer on that, but in the French translation I read, some characters’ voices are hard to tell apart from each other. So if those characters get to rambling about specific cultural details that are not quite relevant to the plot it can get frustratingly tempting to just skim…. This book is really for art and history nerds. If you are not interested in the restrictions imposed by religion on artists to make sure that their work couldn’t be turned into idol worship by the people who would see it, you might find this tedious. If you think philosophical debates about the purpose of art are cool, and you like long conversations about stylistic differences, then you might find this book fascinating. I’ve heard it compared to “The Name of the Rose” in terms of complexity, depth of research and social commentary. I’ve also heard the same warning applied to both books: they are long, intricately detailed and can get very heavy and tedious. I don’t think that such criticism is too far off in the case of “My Name is Red”, but I don’t think that should discourage serious readers from diving in.. I rated it 3 and half stars because I won’t be tempted to re-read this one later (I tend to re-read books I have enjoyed reading, and I can’t say I was having fun with this one), but there’s no doubt in my mind that it’s an important book that deserves the effort.","Sep 20, 2017"
1173554,Steve,"I loved this book. It's passionate, provocative and intelligent, surprisingly bringing the field of 16th-century miniaturist painting to bear on aesthetic and ethical issues that seem urgent (at least for artists) today. The main concern is with the notion of 'style' in art: is it desirable to have a personal style as an artist or are traces of style simply evidence of faults? In the process of investigating this question we discover the more fundamental question: what constitutes 'style'? Characters in the novel approach these questions philosophically, but the characters' positioning within a story makes for a much richer account than a philosophical treatise on the subject could give. The characters have their views on style, but at the same time they are actors – fiercely competitive ones – and any account of their actions according to their philosophical beliefs would be mere theorizing. Two murders and one wedding occur alongside such diverse attempts at explanation by the participating characters as to defy rational accounts of motivation.. Each chapter shifts the first-person narrative to a different character in the story, some of whom even conceal their own voice while narrating. The opening chapter 'I Am a Corpse' gives just the bold shock needed for a book on the seemingly genteel subject of miniature painting.. Hope to read the whole book again, among other reasons in order better to learn the Middle Eastern history contained here from the perspective of Turkey.","Aug 22, 2009"

5558460,Caterina,"A rich layer cake of a novel. Given the complexity and intensity of ideas explored, I found myself wishing that Pamuk had taken a more Proustian, plotless deep-dive rather than trying to force it to be a murder mystery. The explorations of art and ideas fascinated me, and I cared about the complex main characters Shekure and Black and the rocky path of their love relationship. But the middle of the book dragged. Over-writing was a factor, but the biggest drag was the distracting ruse of having to solve a mystery. I just did not care at all who the murderer was! We never really got to know or care about any of the three suspects, they just seemed like a framework to explore art and ideas: the religious, sexual, and power dynamics from which great art sprung.. My fickle heart longs for the West when I'm in the East and for the East when I'm in the West.. My other parts insist I be a woman when I'm a man and a man when I'm a woman.. How difficult it is being human, even worse is living a human's life.. I only want to amuse myself frontside and backside, to be Eastern and Western both.. -- from the narrative of a cross-dressing storyteller who performs in the café, an artistic, political and social center for men that is endangered by religious repression. Pamuk seemed especially interested in, and good at, exploring mixed feelings, ambivalence, multivalence, indecision between multiple viewpoints -- one of my favorite literary topics. The ideals versus perceived realities of love and marriage. The paradoxical effects of religious repression, competition with the West, and contradictory ideas about representation in art. The apprentice system that fostered both great art and rampant sexual abuse of boys by their teachers, the conflicted memories of those artists.. One flaw: the discussions of Venetian versus Ottoman art seemed to be predicated on inaccurate ideas about Western art history. Maybe Pamuk meant to represent only the way the Venetian tradition was viewed by the Ottoman artists of the time? But it seemed to be a misrepresentation. First of all, the flow of influence between East and West was mutual, it wasn’t a one-way path from West to East. But more importantly, Venetian art — even the rediscovery (from ancient Roman and Greek art) of portraiture and female nudes — was replete with religious, mythological, literary and cultural iconography in the Western and Christian traditions, it was never just an attempt to paint exactly what the artist saw, as this novel represents. However, the points Pamuk made about realistic individual portraiture, a ""new"" and controversial thing -- were nevertheless fascinating and seemed valid — even the conflict that existed (in the Christian West as well) about whether this was or was not something God would smile upon.. Regarding the characters, I found the most interesting and complex to be the women: Shekure the beautiful, intelligent, somewhat spoiled and indecisive rich girl who had to find a path to her own power in a world where she is at the legal mercy of men; and Esther, the Jewish trader and message carrier who had a measure of freedom and autonomy but a difficult social position. And I wondered why Hayriye, the servant and concubine, was the only significant character who was never given her own time or her own voice.. This was my first Pamuk novel and I don’t know whether I’m interested in trying another. I might want to try his memoir of Istanbul.","Apr 30, 2017"
98545,Sarah,"Orhan Pamuk won the Nobel Prize for literature this year. Described as “part murder mystery, part love story,” I found this to be an absorbing novel, but what most interested me, and the reason that I recommend this book to you, were the passages which attempt to describe the late sixteenth-century Istanbul miniaturists’ attitudes towards art. My Name is Red, though it seems to be only loosely based upon historical fact, deals with the repercussions of the meeting of two visual worlds: Venetian portraiture and Islamic illustration.. Also, Pamuk writes some of the most fascinating lists I’ve read. I must admit that when I encounter lists in novels I usually skim them, but I found Pamuk’s lists engrossing throughout. I have typed out a few passages that I found especially significant, but they work better in context, of course.. Describing a painting of a horse.. “It is a handsome horse: a horse of the Ottoman line. It is a symbol that would demonstrate to the Venetian Doge Our Sultan’s wealth and the regions under his control. But on the other hand, as with everything the Venetian masters depict, this horse was also to be more lifelike than a horse born of God’s vision, more like a horse that lived in a particular stable with a particular groom in Istanbul so that the Venetian Doge might say to himself, ‘Just as the Ottoman miniaturists have come to see the world like us, so have the Ottomans themselves come to resemble us,’ in turn, accepting Our Sultan’s power and friendship. For if you draw a horse differently, you begin to see the world differently [emphasis added]. Despite its peculiarities, this horse was rendered in the manner of the old masters” (266).. Note the clever implications regarding Pamuk’s own novel.. Did a painting become legendary for what it was or for what was said about it? (266).. The musings of one of the Istanbul miniaturists.. My paintings reveal what the mind, not the eye, sees. But painting, as you know quite well, is a feast for the eyes. If you combine these two thoughts, my world will emerge. That is:. ALIF: Painting brings to life what the mind sees, as a feast for the eyes.. LAM: What the eye sees in the world enters the painting to the degree that it serves the mind.. MIM: Consequently, beauty is the eye discovering in our world what the mind already knows (281).","May 25, 2007"
7022024,Mike,"So yeah, I expected to like this book a lot. I mean, I. typically enjoy books from this setting. . For whatever reason I find the Byzantine and Ottoman Empires fascinating. Maybe because they sit between East and West and end up with a fascinating mix of different cultures and ideas, maybe because they are both so long lasting, or maybe it is because they, like Rodney Dangerfield, don't get no respect. But, as you can tell by the rating, it miserably failed to live up to my expectations.. Whatever the reason this book's description, murder of a miniaturist (artist) that was working on a controversial book for the Sultan, spoke to that part of my book sensibility. I mean, Ottoman Empire + Murder Mystery = Awesome book right? Right?!? RIGHT!?!?!?!. Well, in theory yes, but not in execution, for a multitude of reasons.. The biggest was that I just didn't care about the characters one bit. I didn't find any of them interesting or particularly engaging. Their troubles seemed particularly petty and uninteresting to me. The murder investigation (if it can even be called that) was mostly in the background and didn't really rev up until the end of the book. Too much was dedicated to the dull ""love"" story between Black and Shekure that bored me to no end (it didn't help there was a large age gap and the fact that they were first cousins). The first person and introspective nature of their POV characters just made them even more insufferable. Finally, the frequent change in POV was detrimental to any sort of narrative inertia.. Which isn't to say there were not any interesting characters, it just so happened that the only chapters that were engaging were from the POV of the recently deceased or items a storyteller was speaking through (a counterfeit coin, a dog, a horse). They explored more subtle aspects of Ottoman society and culture with a rather irreverent tone that pleased me. Or maybe they just weren't the boring humans the endeared themselves to me, honestly that bar was pretty low for me by the end.. And this is a shame because the book touches on what I think is a fascinating discussion about art, style, artist workshops, cultural and religious relationships within art and the wider society. All told the examination of how ""Frankish"" art, one that has perspective and tried to perfectly mimic what the artist sees, was going to impact the Ottoman style, which was based on older masters and the philosophy that a painting should represent what Allah saw. The idea that the old ways, which had been preserved for centuries, might be displaced by a new style, a style antithetical to the old way and from infidels, is a rich concept to explore. But the same themes about this topic were repeated too frequently and killed any interesting expansion of these ideas.. This book could have been great. It could have dug deeper into Ottoman society (of which we barely scratched the surface). It could have more clearly plumbed the depths of the artistic style dynamics that drove the action of the story without beating it into the ground. It could have had interesting characters that were dynamic and not bogged down in petty, uninteresting love plot lines. It could have been so much more but it wasn't and that may be the biggest tragedy of the entire thing. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.","Jun 30, 2016"
31294609,Ivan,My favourite book by Orhan Pamuk so far and one of the best pieces of historical fiction I read.,"Oct 27, 2014"
657496,Jeremy Allan,"At first look, Orhan Pamuk’s. My Name is Red. bears many resemblances to Umberto Eco’s. The Name of the Rose. : both take place in a period when manuscript illumination was a prestigious art, both deal in worlds where the licitness of books commanded great spiritual (and thus physical) importance, and both tell the story of a series of murders born out of the struggle for control of these things. Deeper consideration, though, shows that these two novels differ by more than the fact that the former in set in 16th century Istanbul, and the latter in 14th century Italy. Whereas Eco’s book centers on a group of clerics wrestling amongst each other (albeit in ways that represent much broader power struggles) over issues of faith,. My Name is Red. centers on secular artists, and though religion forms a thick blue vein through the story, Pamuk’s book is, before anything else, about art. In fact, to be even more precise, it is about perspective.. First, we have the historical context of the events of the story, where the Ottoman Empire was in frequent contact and competition with various European powers, notably Venice. This fraught contact led to the tentative exchange of ideas, in artistic techniques, for example. Thus, we come upon a major conflict in the background of this story: the arrival of European perspectival techniques in painting. Perspective in the visual arts brought with it a deep problematic in a Muslim society at that time, as the Koran sets clear limits on the righteousness of visual representation.. So, in this sense, we have another approach to perspective, that of competing interpretations of what constitutes righteousness and the righteous life. For Ottomans in the period in question, the official interpretation of the Koran and its religious authority were seated firmly with the Sultan. Pamuk’s story also introduces other perspectives, though, like that of Husret Hoja, a radical cleric who preaches an ascetic interpretation of the Koran, forbidding dancing, music, the drinking of coffee, and other “sinful” indulgences. His fanatic and violent followers reverberate with current fears of fundamentalist extremism of all stripes. Alongside the official, one might say moderate, interpretation and the extremist one, we have the many middling positions inhabited by the vast majority of the characters in the story: those who oscillate between secular and religious poles for reasons of fear, faith, and fastidiousness, among others.. Perhaps the most clear sense in which this story is about perspective, though, is in how it is told: while the novel is written in the first person, each of the fifty-nine chapters is narrated by a different character, and while the main characters reprise their roles as narrator many times, we still have twenty (by my count) different perspectives on what transpires in the story. And the point of view shifts radically, ranging from the perspective of a master illuminator, to a dog, to a corpse speaking from beyond the grave. None of these narrators are to be considered wholly reliable, each one addressing the reader more or less directly, often with the aim of persuading us. Much of that persuasion is related to guilt or innocence, as this is a story centered on murder, but that theme doesn’t exhaust the ways in which the various characters try to win us to their standpoint. They argue for art, religion, common decency, and many other reasons. Part of what makes this book masterful is that each voice is distinct and (mostly) consistent. The few moments where it becomes difficult to distinguish the voices of certain characters are, you discover later, purposeful and functional.. Let it be said: this is a superb book. It combines art, religion, and murder through a cunning weave of voices. No character is faultless, though many are deeply sympathetic, even in their faults. Where perhaps, at times, the story gets a little long-winded, especially in the exhaustive catalogues of paintings that characters marvel over, the expansive quality of the text makes for a good effect when Pamuk gets to the dirty business of violence and action; in a sense, the action is earned. For anyone interested in the period and culture of the middle Ottoman Empire, the text is fascinating and, without question, learned without being too overbearing in its smartness. Even in his great learning, Pamuk knows how to tell a story (to the point that it even becomes a joke in the text itself), even a murder mystery. I, for one, was never sure of the identity of the murderer before it was revealed, and this works well as a mechanism to keep the reader firmly invested in the narrative.. Whodunnit?!. Pamuk dunnit and dunnit well.. That last sentence was hard to write, both because of the annoying spelling, but also because I struggle to grant respect to Pamuk the man. I’ve had an aversion to him since I read his Nobel Prize acceptance speech; I reacted strongly against his ideas of what art is, who gets to make it, and what place he inhabits in that scheme. I also hated how he wrote about his father. But, I have had to soften my distaste and separate the man from the work. While I might still disagree with his personal views on art and writing, I cannot dispute his mastery, and this at least makes it a bit easier to grant him pardon on those personal views: he is so good that it is not a surprise that he feels as he does about the act of creation. And though I am beginning to think he cannot write a woman character (chapter fifty-four, “I Am a Woman,” may be the most revealing testament to that, intentional or not), Pamuk has shown me that despite controversy, the Nobel committee often selects very, very well. My growing love of Mario Vargas Llosa also adds to this sentiment of mine, but we’ll see how it progresses.. In any case, I recommend this book to anyone who has liked. The Name of the Rose. , even if I’ve already gone to lengths to show how the two books differ. Anyone interested should also not be scared off by the 666 pages: call him a devil, but if you commit yourself to the first four chapters, you’ll find yourself devoted to the rest of Pamuk’s tale. Besides, the pages turn easily; I found myself effortlessly reading one hundred pages in a sitting. If you’re still not certain, and if you haven’t already, try some of his other books first:. Snow. and. Istanbul. are both recommended. He still pisses me off, this Orhan Pamuk, but perhaps that is partly motivated by raw envy. In considering that, I realize that with. My Name is Red. , he has certainly taught me something, and that is his gift to give.","Aug 13, 2013"
5204784,Vonia,"This started out amazing. The first chapter is narrated by a dead man, Elegant Enfendi. Each chapter after that is narrated by someone indicated in a subtitle, including the protagonist (arguable) Black; his love interest since childhood/also his cousin Shekure; the other main miniaturists, nicknamed Butterfly, Olive, and Stork; the murderer (the main suspects are the other three miniaturists); Black's uncle/Shekure's father/the head miniaturist who was overseeing a secretive book requested by his grace the Sultan that led to this murder, Enishte Enfendi; Esther, the clothier, local gossip, and matchmaker on the side, one of me favorite personalities (""Does love make one a fool, or do only fools fall in love?""); a coin, a tree, the color red (""colors are not known, but felt""; try to explain a color to someone who has always been blind.. Does this all seem confusing? Well, it was. Definitely found myself needing to reread; reading a lot of beautiful words and passages, but then having to question what exactly it was that I read.. As the novel went on it became more and more philosophical, becoming more confusing as it went. Most of it was interesting, though drawn out. By the last hundred pages, I really lost interest and moved on to another book before coming back to finish reading this. Even then, it was a little bit of work.. One of the things I always love about Orhan Pamuk is how he ""cameos"" in most of his novels. Here, he is the younger son to Shekure, the one who likes Black, while his older brother has a loyalty to Shekure's first husband and their father, missing for years now.. Obviously there is a lot of history here; the Ottoman time period, accurately portrayed, even very well portrayed from what I understand. Time and setting are there own characters here. Most of it went over my head, as I am the first to admit that history is not my forté. A chronology from around 330 B.C. until 1617 is even included as an appendix.. I did like the ambiance of the novel, the feeling and transporting experience that Pamuk is always able to masterfully create. A world with Sultans and swords, gilded illustrations and beautiful books, secret bills and illuminated manuscripts, jinns and ghosts, gold coins and palaces, dark alleys and open air markets, murder and intrigue, love and war. There is constant mention of the ancient story of Hüsrev and Shirin, in particular a scene where she falls in love with him after seeing his picture, a frame having from a tree in the countryside.. I found interesting the method used by Master Osman to determine the murderer. In a painting of a horse they know to be by the hand of the murderer, they notice an irregularity on its nose. To locate this same irregularity again would be to locate the murderer. At least according to the ""courtesan method"", which would uncover the hidden signature of the artist, borne by a horse which has been drawn from memory through the quick and skillful movement of the hand. The theory goes that artists draw from memory (even when copying another painting, the artist is looking at his own painting and hand as he paints, so for those few seconds from looking from the other painting to his own, is still painting from memory), and therefore in something so subtle could not be prevented. ""Even mediocre artists must know a genuine illustration isn't drawn according to what the eye sees at any particular moment, but according to what the hand remembers and is accustomed to. The painter is always alone before the page. Solely for this reason he is always dependent on memory."". Incorporated with the above is the belief first expressed by the great miniaturist Bihzad that the greatest illustrators would be granted blindness by Allah in their later years. Many of the miniaturist of the old style still look upon blindness as a great virtue of Allah's Grace, and may even sit for weeks in the darkness in the dim light in order to learn how to receive the world like a blind man, despite not truly being blind. Bizhad blinded himself in order to avoid being forced to paint like the Venetians. Master Osman does the same. Black blinds Olive, the murderer, before he escapes (then is subsequently murdered). This is an interesting concept to me, as I do see a great amount of validity in the idea that the best artist should be able to draw and paint blindly.. The main art philosophy discussed is how the miniaturists (illustrators are called miniaturists here) should be painting. Namely, the Ottoman way is to follow tradition, to not try to stand out. Painting without its story is impossible. ""Style"" is imperfection. A perfect one needs no signature. ""Signature"" and ""Style"" are but means of brazenly The feared, ""sinful"" way is that of the French. The secret book (one painting especially) Enishte was is charge of, by request from The Sultan, was such a sin and was the cause of the murder and all the subsequent drama because 1) things were not depicted according to their importance in Allah's mind, but realistically, as they appeared to the naked eye; 2) The Sultan, The Caliph of Islam, was the same size as a pet; 3) Satan was also the same size, furthermore, in an endearing light; worst of all, 4) The Sultan, like the Christians and their idolatrous tendencies with their portraits, was as large as life and his face had full details!. Conclusion: Should have been a lot shorter. Has some great insights into Art Philosophy. Another great portrayal of the Turkish/Ottoman time period. Liked the metafiction/fourth wall aspects and Pamuk's cameo. Would have loved this if it were condensed.. ""Painting meant seeing this world yet depicting it as if it were the Otherworld."". "" What we essentially want is to draw something unknown to us in all its shadowiness, not something known to us in all its illumination."" (I disagree. I want something unknown to us in all its illumination. But something to think about.). **** Spoilers ****. I guessed who the murderer was early on. One of the main clues for me was on Page 238.. Elegant Effendi believed that portraiture was the greatest of sins and it was because Olive was afraid he would reveal what they had all done (albeit unknowingly) for this secret book, shaming them all, that he died.. Aside from the art discussions, there is the story of protagonist Black. He had been in love with his cousin Shekure since they were young children. In fact, he left Turkey as a young teenager after being turned down by her on order to forget her. It is now right years later and he has returned from his world travels. Shekure had since married, but her husband went off to war and had yet to return. He did that his love for her had never died, and she has some for him (keyword ""some"". I never get the sender she truly loves him with any passion). In order to marry Black, she has to file for divorce by finding neighbors to pledge to her husband's death. I believe she is doing this for selfish reasons; because her husband's brother Hasan is determined to ""keep"" Shekure, almost as a slave. According to him, under the eyes of Allah, she belongs to him, the brother of a very much alive man who he has claimed for years will return very soon.. After the showdown amongst the illustrators, the murderer Olive stabs Black in the shoulder before his escape into the night; his plan is to board a ship the following morning. Hasan, mistaking him for one of Black's men who had abducted Shekure from his place in the middle of the night, murdered him before this could transpire. Black's wounds are not fatal, but does cause his shoulders to be uneven for the remainder of his life. As told by ""I, Shekure"" in the final chapter, he is depressed from then on; not, as most suspect, because of his neck that never completely heals. Shekure is not entirely sure why her husband black is depressed for the rest of his life, but I suspect it has to do with his loss of pride. It certainly does not help that her ex husband's brother Hasan was the one who killed Olive, the one deed Shekure had asked of him, to avenge her father's murderer. Shekure, in my opinion, never truly loves Black; is admittedly a little in love with Hasan.. The secret book with the sinful paintings, the book that started all these murders, was never finished.","Feb 17, 2017"
1805692,Amalia,"I've spent quite a bit of time debating how to rate this book- more than once it nearly landed on my ""May I please have these hours of my life back"" shelf, mostly because it moves so, so slowly and because (for me) the detail that Pamuk puts into it turns into nothing more than tedium.. However, parts of the story are so beautiful and well-written (see the chapters written from the perspective of the color red or the horse in the painting) that I don't feel that my time was entirely wasted.. Why this book was difficult for me:. -The book moves incredibly slowly; as best I was able to calculate, all 400+ pages of ""action"" occur in approximately one week.. -I found it absolutely impossible to connect with the characters at an emotional level. Esther, who is a bit player, was the one I found most interesting and would really enjoy learning more about.. -Did I mention that it's really, really slow-moving? Like molasses. In winter.. Why this book was wonderful:. -Pamuk's writing is lyrical, as it always is.. -The cultural tension of being Turkish and the implications of the Eastern and Western influences; this was something that going to Turkey gave me a much greater appreciation for..

3687216,Yelda Basar Moers,"""Painting is the silence of thought and the music of sight."". I adore this book, a love story and philosophical thriller immersed in the life of miniature painting in the Ottoman court. I found myself spellbound by its prose the first time I read it! And now even more so with the second read. Nobel-prize-winning Turkish author Orhan Pamuk has a style reminiscent of Borges, Proust and Nabokov. A soulful, dreamy quality emanates from his sentences and chapters, which read like an epic poem as much as they illuminate with vibrant storytelling. There are so many poignant and poetic phrases, such as ""I don't want to be a tree, I want to be its meaning,"" ""to paint is to remember,"" and ""time doesn't flow if you don't dream."". My Name is Red is set in the 16th century Ottoman Empire and chronicles the lives of a workshop of miniaturists who have been commissioned by the reigning Sultan to complete a book of paintings. Two of the members are murdered and the main narrative follows the trail of discovering the culprit. It is a philosophical thriller but also a love story. One of my favorite passages from the book is the following: ""Tell me then, does love make one a fool or do only fools fall in love?"". There are at times the most intricate details about miniature painting and multiple narratives that switch with each chapter (there are a total of twelve narrators, among them the main characters, but also Satan, Death, a Tree and a Dog). The book has its own original form, almost as a miniature painting in itself, and delves into the life of 16th century Islamic miniature art in a way that few books can do. Orhan Pamuk himself won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2008. His writing enchants and leaves me breathless every time! He's written a number of novels, essays and a beautiful memoir about Istanbul, the city my father was born and raised in. I've read several of his books and I look forward to reading the rest of his oeuvre!. Some critics say the novel is dead, but My Name is Red is an example of how the novel is very much alive.

5459072,Neal Adolph,"Let me be careful here, talking about this big and beautiful book. The three stars doesn't reflect the heights that it brought me to, the excitement it filled me with, the thrill of beautiful language and beautiful imagery, of endearing characters and of interesting ideas. No, the three stars doesn't capture that, and so I think you would be mostly wise to ignore the stars entirely; maybe you can even forgive me for having used stars. I like them. They are pretty.. But I can't give the book more than three stars in good conscience, and so I have settled on that worst of all the numbers - the one that spreads from the truly disappointing. The Human Stain. to the passable and pleasant. The Glassy Sea. to the endearing and enduring. Segu. - in the hopes that you will overlook the writing and give this book a chance one day. It contains a lot of gems.. The most prominent of those gems is, I would say, the writing, which at times is over-indulgent, but is almost always beautiful. When it gets going, when its pacing is just right, it reaches the heights of Garcia Marquez and Rushdie, the high romanticism of euphoria. When it isn't quite right it fumbles in search of some good editing.. The next most prominent is the theme, or the layers of themes, which fill this book. It plays with art, predominantly, and how that art should be informed by society or shouldn't be, and what kind of relationship we can have with art. It ranges from the obsessive, to the conservative, to those desiring mass changes to the standard to those hoping to protect. It tosses in colonialism, and the political battles between East and West at the end of the 16th Century. It discusses power, of course, as all things do. It really does all of these things wonderfully, beautifully, wrapping it all in the often miraculous words and sentences and images that I referenced above.. The next most prominent, for me, is the depth of the world that we are shown in this book. This is a strength, though I found it difficult for me to interact with it at times given my extreme ignorance of the region, the religion, the history and context. But it is lovely, and rich, in its representation here. I was often totally impressed by the meta-fictional references to literature from 450 years ago. I was often totally impressed by the body of parables that Pamuk brings to the table. This is clearly a world very different than anything I have ever experienced, and it is, in many ways, a beautiful place to let your mind explore for a bit.. The next most prominent are the voices. There are a lot of them in this book with each chapter having a different narrator than the one which preceded it. At times those voices are from inanimate objects which have some grand story about how they have come to exist, and that, in their way, add some kind of commentary onto the book. I love thinking of being told a story by a coin, a tree drawn on paper, a skull, the colour Red, but I also came to admire the intelligence of Black, of Osman, of Shekure, and, most of all, of Esther. The characters here are endearing, memorable, pleasant to witness and read the world with.. So the voices are great, and they make great characters. Except for those characters which are, perhaps, most important to the central murder plot. Butterfly, Stork, Olive, and Elegant are all difficult to differentiate from each other. I guess that is important as plot device, but it makes the plot seem like it is fluffy - a poorly disguised vehicle to explore some of the ideas which the author found more intriguing. And here is the cause of the three stars (everything I have said thus far would suggest that the book is worthy at least of 4, no?). The plot is difficult to make sense of as it develops and, when it does take on some kind of concrete form for the reader, it ultimately feels like it is borderline absurd or silly, and really not of any great consequence. It has its strong moments, of course, but it also had its weak moments - and unfortunately, it ends on a moment of weakness rather than power.. But I don't think anybody is really going to come away from this book feeling like they read it for the story or plotline - at least, I hope not. It contains something far more important to offer us, stories and ideas far more intriguing than the story we are witnessing. I would like to come back to it after learning more about Turkey and the Ottoman Empire, maybe after reading more by Pamuk. I suspect there are a great many secrets I have missed entirely. Illuminated scripts sound enchanting and this book may be as well.","Nov 15, 2016"

Hate: went on for way too long and after about 40% of the 20+ hours (count them!!!!) it devolved into a boring story of which miniaturist drew what in order to figure out who the murderer was, how they either went blind or put their eyes out because blindness was a source of pride, etc. etc. I was ready to poke my own eyes out!. But I persevered and listened to the entire thing. John Lee did an admirable job in voicing all the characters and I'm glad I read this even though I didn't like it as much overall as I did in the first part. It could have been exhilarating if the second 60% had been condensed.","Dec 17, 2016"

This was a mystery in a beautiful setting and beautiful language. I could not read this book too fast. Many paragraphs and chapters I had to re-read to make sure I was getting the full meaning. That's not too say this book was dense or hard to read. It is just that it is a book to be savored.. The mystery plot was well thought out and the use of multiple points of view - while frustrating at times - made for an excellent plot.","Dec 09, 2016"
7392004,Quo,"My Name is Red. is a novel on a grand scale, set in 16th century Istanbul, a tale that is complex, wondrous & at times humorous but which also represents an occasionally frustrating blend of Turkish history, autobiographical detail & ultimately a murder mystery that sweeps the reader into the late medieval Muslim world of miniaturist art & the lives of those devoted to creating it. Orhan Pamuk's masterful work of fiction can be compared to Herman Hesse'. Magister Ludi. (The Bead Game) and Umberto Eco's. The Name of the Rose. .. The first person narrative includes the primary miniature artists, including Olive, Stork, Butterfly & Black but also extended to their mentor & head illustrator, Osman, Black's beloved, Shekure, a tree, a horse, a dog, a corpse, Satan & two dervishes. The elaborate cast of characters stating their case even includes the color red, becoming akin to an active character in the novel. In an attempt to describe how these many divergent voices interact with each other, I would suggest that. My Name is Red. functions as a kind of morality play pitting opposed forces against one another--good vs. evil; east vs. west, with Istanbul as crossroads; traditional Muslim miniaturist art vs. the encroaching force of Venetian or ""Frankish"" (western) art that is more representational & more personal; and even Persian military strength & Chinese influence arriving via the Silk Road, viewed as a threat to Islamic art, to the Koran & to the Turkish interpretation of history.. However, of the many infidel or non-Islamic incursions, the greatest peril occurs when the sultan sends envoys to Italy to view Venetian paintings that are far different from traditional miniaturist art in terms of style, use of color, the manner in which the characters are personalized & even the employment of the artist's signature on the painting, all of which are seen by some as a distinct threat to Islamic values. For, traditional miniaturist art is representational only in a vague manner, most certainly never portraying specific or recognizable faces rather than generic figures. It is declared by a renowned Islamic historian from Herat in present-day Afghanistan that ""the greatest sin of the devil is to say. I. "". Alas, there are a great many ""infidel influences"", coffee among them. Here is just one view of the way in which the work of a miniaturist is viewed:. We mistakenly assumed that these stories arose out of words & that illustrations were painted in service to these stories. Quite to the contrary, painting is the act of seeking out Allah's memories & viewing the world as he sees it. A miniaturist united with the vision & landscape of Allah's immortal time can never return to the manuscript pages meant for ordinary mortals.. My Name is Red. is exceedingly dense at times, introducing Turkish history & rarefied words dealing with miniature art that have a particular meaning only in the context of the story, while at the same time conveying a rich tapestry of detail that with each page causes the reader to become increasingly invested in this amazing jigsaw puzzle of novel. One of the considerable allegorical tools used by Orhan Pamuk in. My Name is Red. is countering the illumination of visual detail via illustration with blindness. The author does this very adeptly throughout his novel. Miniaturists are so devoted to their craft that eventual blindness is seen as a gift.. They accepted the work, the endless drawing & staring at pages by candlelight for days without break, as the pleasurable labor that delivered the miniaturist to blindness, with some seeking out the most appropriate moment for this most glorious of approaching eventualities, either by purposely hurrying blindness through the painstaking depictions of trees & all their leaves on fingernails, grains of rice & even on strands of hair, or by cautiously delaying the imminent darkness by the effortless drawing of pleasant sun-filled gardens. Some of the miniaturists of the old style look upon blindness as the greatest virtue of Allah's grace & they are embarrassed by growing old but not blind.. Later in the novel, a miniaturist intentionally blinds himself in order to ""preserve his vision"" of art within his consciousness, while not being called upon to adjust to a changing style, while another artist is blinded by a rival. The questions arises as to whether the measure of a miniaturist's talent is to depict everything with perfection or to introduce into the picture that which no one else can see. Always, art is driven by an intense life-force which can either ""force the most devout man to renounce his faith or bring the most hopeless, unrepentant unbeliever to Allah's path"". For, if an artist draws a horse differently, he begins to see the world differently, with the ensuing personal style seen as leading to damnation.. What attracts us to writing, illustrating & painting in bound up in a fear of retribution. We also want those we have forsaken to see & appreciate the inspired pictures we've made, even if they should call us sinners. Genuine painting is hidden in the agony no one sees & which others will call bad, heretical or blasphemous. Oh the suffering this brings upon the painter of genuine talent, a frightful, nerve-wracking experience! The birth of a new style vs. imitation of an old one results in years of disagreements, jealousies & rivalries.. There is murder embedded within. My Name is Red. but to even hint at the complexity to this aspect of the novel might come close to revealing the mystery that is at the heart of Orhan Pamuk's master work. What constituted for me much of the beauty of this expansive novel was the author's attempt to have the reader see the world through the eyes of the characters in a miniature painting, to drop back in time as it were & to visualize Istanbul in the 16th century, with each element of this mosaic of characters having a distinct voice, even if the reader is a. Frank. (non-Islamic) spectator ""committing the error of looking at the world with his naked eye & rendering what he saw."". As with the title of the Pamuk novel, red is more than just a color in the miniaturists' palate but has a metaphorical & symbolic role to play, merging bloodshed with a dominant, forceful color, as when a character intones, ""we imagined how we watched with pleasure the slow spread of a deadly red seeping from a bronze inkpot that had cracked over a page 3 illuminators have labored on for 3 months."" Likewise, there are frequent references to the early 11th century Persian epic, the. Shahnameh. (""Book of Kings"") by Ferdowsi & to the tale of Husrev & Shirin, a 12th century Persian work by Nizami. There are elements in. My Name is Red. that bear witness to these classic stories & others that are drawn from the author's own life.. I have chosen to focus on the craft of painting & illustration in my review because it was through a long consideration of the process of painting that Orhan Pamuk was able to distill his knowledge of miniatures into the tale that eventually became the novel. However, in this way, I can also avoid dealing with spoiler alerts & leave the solution to the novel's great mystery component to future readers.. My Name is Red. represents a fusion of words & colors, of narrative tale & miniature art + the fairy tale-like material derived from classical Islamic literature, all in all, a magical blend.. *The author's very personal introduction in my Everyman's Library/Alfred A. Knopf version of the novel is extensive & stands as an overview of the gestation process for. My Name is Red. , 6 years in the process of writing but reflective of the author's lifetime of interest in painting in general & specifically the world of miniature art. The translation from the Turkish was by Erdag Goknar. **The map & historical chronology were also quite helpful.","Sep 16, 2019"
1207684,Bruce,"This novel by Orhan Pamuk, Nobel Prize in Literature-winning Turkish author, is creatively written and raises intriguing questions about the process of artistic production.. Using the chronology at the end of the book, I conclude that the book’s events are taking place at the end of the 16th century. The multiple perspectives - each short chapter reflects a different one - seem to be different characters. The setting is Istanbul. A murder has occurred. Who is the murderer? “Olive” or “Stork” or “Butterfly”? Woven throughout this fascinating philosophic and artistic treatise is an engaging mystery story. Another murder occurs; we know the murderer but not his name. Black and Sekure finally get married, an apparent resolution of sorts but too early in the book, just halfway through, to be convincing as the reliever of tension. And indeed, complications immediately begin to arise. Now the artistic argument is turned on its head, and Horse asserts that the painting of Generic Horse, or the Form of Horse, is idolatrous and that the painting of the particular as it simply is seen is preferable. The plot becomes more dangerous, the outcome unclear until the novel’s very end.. The main characters are artistic miniaturists, illustrators of manuscripts. Tiny hints in each chapter, often just a word or a phrase, provide linkages between chapters and clarify relationships between characters. These make the narrative comprehensible. A key issue or question involves the process of artistic creation, whether the perfection of creativity is originality or rather whether true virtuosity consists of absolute subjugation of the artist to tradition, without any evidence in the work of his own “style” or signature characteristics, ie keeping himself absolutely anonymous. There is initial discussion of the Islamic injunction against specific artistic representation of objective reality vs Venetian portraiture, representation of a specific individual person, thus identifiable. This issue is at the root of the issues to be explored in this novel. The desire for originality by an artist seems to imply the desire for personal renown, and that is to imply a fall from perfection, perfection in a work of art implying purity, without any reference to the artist. The perfect artist would create the same work of art again and again, precisely the same each time, doing nothing to draw attention to himself as creator. Representational painting elevates the importance of the object represented and runs the risk that the representation itself will come to be worshipped, a form of idolatry. By extension, all art - consider, for example, literature - becomes the product of a human creator imitating or even co-opting the office of the Divine. Art, like language, becomes not only an abstraction from and of reality, and thus “art-ificial” but also a temptation, the seduction being that it might be valued not only in and of itself but also above Reality. This argument of course has validity only if one posits a Creator outside Creation; if one denies that, then any creation has equal validity and value.. Again and again the narrative explores the nature of art, the differences in both technique and philosophy between Islamic and European painting. I am fascinated by the insights into Islamic illumination of manuscripts and miniature painting. Social customs are interesting, too. A recurrent theme is the waning of the artistic paradigm of the Ottoman region and era, that of ornamentation, in favor of the European (Venetian and Frankish) paradigm of representation, the former eventually succumbing to the latter. Neither really reflects reality but rather a frozen and static moment that presents emotion only with difficulty.. The conservative nature of established religion, considering anything innovative heretical, is certainly still with us. “Two styles heretofore never brought together…come together to create something new and wondrous…May (Allah) protect us from the will of the pure and unadulterated.” That is the liberal challenge. “A great painter does not content himself by affecting us with his masterpieces; ultimately, he succeeds in changing the landscape of our minds.” This is the promise, and this is the threat. Is there something about Islam that is fundamentally conservative vis-à-vis Christianity and Western Civilization? While that point is debatable, it is also probably too baldly stated. Both clearly have conservative and liberal elements, but one gains the impression in this book that Pamuk is asserting that the emphasis of the former is more conservative. I found this work fascinating and challenging, raising important issues and questions. Pamuk writes very well, and his style is engaging. There are hints throughout the book pointing to the often critical reception that his writing has received in his home country.","Apr 17, 2011"
41578933,Pechi,"Much like its heartland Istanbul known for its unique confluence of the cultures of East and West, My Name is Red is a fascinating junction of genres - thriller, mystery, literary & historical fiction, ekphrasis, and by a stretch, romance. The story is told in a refreshingly unique form - each chapter in the perspective of a character or an object or even a color. This slideshow of perpetually shifting perspectives is an enormous risk because it could all go awry way too easily and with a high probability, frustrate the readers into abandoning the book (The Spinning Heart comes to my mind). But Orhan Pamuk seamlessly breezes through this obstacle and the storytelling remains novel as ever for the complete length of the book.. Illustrations, illuminations, paintings, lives of the artists creating these works of art, their thoughts and struggles, the religious and political meteorology of their times, forces and desires influencing and giving shape to their lives - My Name is Red wafts through these subjects with a subtle ease and uncommon depth, and succeeds in leaving a lasting impression of the zeitgeist of the 16th century Turkey.. I've never given much thought to the evolution of paintings over centuries or the lives of artists living in extremely repressive religious circumstances and it was very interesting to delve into these spheres. Creation of art being chained to religious beliefs and moral policing with pious zealots acting as the ultimate arbiters of art (Satanic Verses much?) could either suppress all imagination or give rise to interesting and clever new works. Here, it plays a very important psychological role in guiding the miniaturists and their complex emotions, causing them to be entangled in a constant tug of war between faith and art. Any innovation and individual style is considered sacrilegious and the response of different artists to this attitude is interesting to observe. I would never have imagined that painting a face as it is would have been such a taboo 500 years ago!. While the abundance of fascinating detail holds us in rapture for the first half of the book, it backfires midway and injects a steady stream of tedium into our reading experience. I was most enraged by the chapter where Master Osman goes through hundreds of books in a library in search of the illustration of a horse. Similar sounding illustrations from most of these books are described in painstaking detail for pages and pages and unbearable more pages. It is obvious that a great amount of research went into the making of this book but cramming all the details into the narrative is plain unacceptable.. A brilliant book that could've been much better had it not been consumed by its own magnificence and dragged down by its very weight.. Btw, here are some random facts that surprised me:. *The existence of book arts! Does this still happen in our century?. *Taboo associated with painting in those times and the contempt for 'Frankish' portraits. We take so much for granted these days!. *Presence of slaves in Turkey. While black slavery is much written about, we don't frequently encounter many of these slaves belonging to other countries in famous literature. Are there any books about these forgotten people? Am I just being super ignorant here?. *The plight of intelligent women in the olden times.. *The very obvious current of homosexuality in such religious circumstances. *Chinese influence on Turkey","Jun 20, 2016"
2876105,Marc,"Pamuk has done his best to bring the reader into confusion. This book is composed of 59 relatively short monologues by different characters related to one another, but also from non-human characters (a coin, a tree, a dog and the book even opens with a corpse talking, yes!). Think Faulkner, but driven one step further. It takes a while before you can distinguish the storylines.. The place of action is Istanbul, late 16th century, the Ottoman empire at its height. The main storyline is the discussion and (deadly) fight between miniaturists at the court of the sultan about wether the eastern or western style should be followed when airing manuscripts. The oriental style stands for the idealistic representation of the classic stories (from a divine perspective; and mastery expresses itself in perfect imitation), the occidental stands for naturalism with recognizable faces (the individuals perspective; mastery lies in a very own special style). It's a discussion on the cutting edge, because murders happen, what makes the book seem a bit like ""the name of the Rose"" by Umberto Eco (with its references to Borges). The second storyline revolves around the graceful Sjekure which is coveted by several men after her husband has been missing for four years.. The short pieces, each with varying perspective give the book momentum and you regularly make new discoveries; and the many oriental tales give the work an entertaining, exotic flavor. And, of course, the fundamental debate (realism versus idealism in art) is extremely fascinating. But while reading I more and more got the impression that Pamuk was talking about something else than just a debate amongst artistic schools. The opposition Muslim-Western art is far too simplistic, because in Islamic art too there were more realistic movements, while idealism regularly resurfaces in western art. Pamuk seems to join the Orientalism representation ( ""East is East and West is West, and never the twain Shall Meet""), which is a completely outdated vision. Maybe he just wanted to expose fundamentalism (in this book represented by the godfearing illuminators), but then he did not do a convincing job. Moreover, the storyline around Sjekure really disappointed me: her character is very one-dimensional (like the other female figure Esther), so much so that I have serious questions about the female image of Pamuk.. All in all, an entertaining and sometimes fascinating read, but I had expected more. (2.5 stars)","May 24, 2016"
46365949,Ishaque A.,"Profoundly exuberant, this book is a piece of art in itself. It is deeply rich in history and culture and gives deep insight into the art of painting during the Ottoman reign in the 16th century Istanbul.. There are extremely minute and comprehensive details about the designs, colors, brushes, drawing styles as well as the jealousy and love among the painters, gilders, miniaturists and masters in the painting workshops that one feels like being a part of that era while reading this book. The author has taken the reader throughout the book in a unique style where each and every character and the objects, pictures and even colors communicate directly in first person to the reader and fascinate with their story and explain the context in their own point of view. There are in-depth details and stories within stories which will take the reader to a further deeper level in this colorfully rich tapestry and in parallel to this, there is a love story, and a murder mystery which is to be solved by the reader himself as every object and character gives a clue to complete the missing piece of the puzzle.. It was fascinating to read about an empire which was once the most powerful and was slowly coming to its decline. The unwritten dogma of blindness among master miniaturists was unknown to me until I have read this book and is really strange to know that natural blindness among them was perceived as an honour or even a gift of God, some miniaturists went too far to protect their style that they purposely either blinded themselves or pretended to be blind for the rest of their lives. I didn’t know that homosexuality was common among Muslims of that time, if in any case, it is true, especially using young boys for carnal desires is very disturbing.. I am amazed by the deep knowledge of art and history Orhan Pamuk possesses and is capable of not just imagining the story of that period but also to represent the intricate details in such a beautiful way that it felt like observing all of it as a master miniaturist examining an extraordinary work of art with his magnifying lens.. The art of painting is already lost and is not something which is found among Muslims nowadays, this quote from the book concludes sadly what we have lost:. “Just as the doors of houses are closed of an evening and the city is left to darkness, painting was also abandoned. It was mercilessly forgotten that we’d once looked upon our world quite differently”","May 17, 2017"

1798222,Shane,"A treasure trove of a book that provides rich insights into art in the Ottoman Empire and the conflict caused by the influence of god-less European styles on its evolution, while teasing the reader along with a murder-mystery plot and a love story to hold interest.. The central plot involves the murders of miniaturist painters by one of their peers. Why? These miniaturists are painting human and animal images to illustrate a book commissioned by the Sultan, at a time when imagery is frowned on by the Ottomans and is considered to be usurping the power of God. Only the Frankish painters of Europe have perfected the art of perspective, imagery and portraiture, which every wealthy person, including the Sultan, sees as his path to immortality. The secondary plot involves the long-suffering love story of Black and Shekure; he a writer commissioned to write the Sultan’s book, she the wife of a soldier gone missing in battle and who thus is not free to re-marry or divorce.. The novel is narrated by a myriad of voices: the miniaturists, the victims, the paintings, Black, Shekure, secondary characters, and the murderer. And this is the book’s weakness, for after awhile many of these first-person narratives blend into a single voice. But the breadth of the multiple voices provide a panoramic sweep of 16th century life in Istanbul: its customs, history, politics, religious and social divisions, and the various tools and environments of the artist’s trade. One narrator, a coin, traces its path through the hands and orifices of the many who have handled it in the last little while, and you could end up being squeamish of dealing in cash and coin henceforth! We also get a tour through the art collection stored in the Royal Treasury and it comes replete with legends and stories associated with the subjects depicted—rich lore similar to another Thousand and One Nights epic. Even the miniaturists associate their philosophy of life with legend and they recount their pet stories in interesting detail. Not all of these side stories are relevant to the central plot, but I sensed that the Nobel-Prize aspiring author Pamuk (he won the award a few years after this book was published) was seeking to infuse his novel with grand themes that build a hefty oeuvre deemed worthy of the Nobel.. The painter’s philosophy is explained: Style and Signature is the drive for individuality and differentiation, and Blindness is the ultimate goal of the miniaturist whose eyes succumb after years of work on fine detail, like painting on grains of rice. Some seek blindness voluntarily in order to paint from memory which is supposed to be better than painting from observation. God is supposedly revealed through Blindness.. The style of writing is classical and dense, and, while creating the right atmosphere, can impede the stagecraft during action scenes; it also lends to repetition as we hover over the same issues while different narrators offer their individual perspectives on them. The characters of Black and Shekure are unusual as lovers and stilted in their performance; Black comes across as a martyr while Shekure is a scheming, insecure woman. Both are pretty amateur in the sex department, perhaps reflective of the sexual behaviour of their restricted social class at the time.. There is a lot in the book, and it all cannot be commented on in a short review of this nature, and even though there are many off-plot digressions, these detours are interesting, for they enhance our knowledge of the Ottoman Empire and of human thought at that time. One thing is certain: ego, vanity, envy, pride, poverty and dedication were the lot of the artist then as it is now. And I never guessed who the murderer was and therefore kept reading to the last page.. This book is to be approached with respect and with a curiosity to learn about history and art, while allowing oneself to be entertained by the writer’s pet ploys (or crutches): the murder-mystery puzzle and the love story.","Jun 08, 2017"
42294189,Roger Brunyate,"No Miniature This!. My Name Is Red. is a huge and densely-composed novel set in late-16th-century Istanbul among the small closed circle of miniature painters, who work their whole lives until (and even after) they go blind, illustrating books which may never been seen again by any other than their rich patrons. Though clearly a masterpiece, it is by no means an easy read.. I came to this after reading Pamuk's later novel,. Snow. .. What the two have in common is a concern with Islam and an examination of its place in a secularized world; they also share a large scale and a certain sense of fantasy. But whereas. Snow. is set in the modern world (albeit a distant outpost of it) and is told from a single perspective,. My Name Is Red. takes the reader back to 1591 and proceeds in a kaleidoscope of short chapters written by different characters in the story—including Satan, a corpse, a dog, a tree, and (as in the title) a pot of red ink! Even the covers of the two books show their differences:. Snow. almost monochromatic,. My Name Is Red. a collage of brilliantly colored panels and borders from miniatures such as those described in the book. The color, lightness, and even sense of fun draw the reader easily into the book until he is either held or repelled by the intensity of its philosophical argument.. There are two main plot strands: the mystery of a master miniaturist murdered by one of his colleagues, and a love story. The latter, actually, is not dissimilar to the situation in Snow: an exile returning after many years, hoping to be reunited with a former sweetheart who has since married another man. But, as in much medieval and renaissance literature, the point is less the story than the many digressions within the story: lists, legends, historical precedents, parables and counterparables, and above all disquisitions on the nature and purpose of figurative art within a culture whose religion forbids it. Pamuk's handling of these sections is virtuosic, and they become the verbal equivalent of the miniatures and decorations in an illuminated manuscript, and the main reason why one opens the book.. I would have to say that Pamuk does not seem to put much emphasis on the delineation of character, or perhaps that he is not always successful at it. The major figures in the love story come over quite clearly: the writer Black, his beloved Shekure, her children Shevket and Orhan, and (to a lesser extent) her father Enishte. But the miniaturists—nicknamed Olive, Butterfly, and Stork—one of whom must be the murderer, are distinguished more by subtle differences in their attitude to their art than by qualities of character. So the reader has little alternative but to go along with the author in solving the mystery more as a theorem in aesthetics and religion than as an outcome of human nature.. The book's color and brilliance of linguistic invention reminds me a little of Salman Rushdie, though Pamuk is a much cooler writer. But the closest parallel that comes to mind (although it is a long time since I read the book) is Umberto Eco's. The Name of the Rose. —another murder mystery used to frame historical, religious, and philosophical disquisitions in the old manner. Readers who enjoyed Eco should certainly try Pamuk.","Apr 30, 2016"
3131238,Judy,"My Name is Red. captures the essence of an era of Turkish book illustration during the 16th century. It is a crafty murder mystery centering around the murder of Elegant Effendi, a gold giltworker employed by the workshop of Master Osman and involved in moonlighting for his father-in-law on a Shah-commissioned book.. What I liked:. *Pamuk conceals the murder exceptionally well. Although, I had suspicions I never quite knew for sure who the murderer was until revealed. He strings the reader along expertly. Well done!. *The uniqueness of telling the story from several first-person viewpoints including the perspective of a tree, dog and coin kept me interested, if for nothing else, to see if I would get tired of it, until the end of the book.. *Pamuk's writing style contains a spunkiness that I enjoyed.. *The reader is immersed in the history, religion and culture of the Ottoman Empire, particularly in regards to illustration.. Okay, what's not to like? Well, a lot:. *Pamuk does. too. good of a job of immersing the reader in the history, religion and culture. The narrators gushing over aspects of ancient illustrations got very tedious!. *This book as billed as a love story in addition to the mystery. IMO, its only a love story by loose definition. I admired Shekure for being a clever woman, but the ""love story"" angle seems to get lost (for the most part) in the last one-third of the book. There is a token chapter devoted to Shekure at the end of the book, but it seems anti-climatic and disappointing after the murderer is revealed.There is a lengthy section of the book between Shekure's last two chapters allowing the reader to forget about her problems.. *I found the frequent references to buggering young apprentices nauseous. Particularly, since the book treated it like the young boys were being done a favor by being buggered by the much older miniaturists and Master Osman. Also, none of the buggering figured into the plot of the story in the least. It was totally extra ""color"". Perhaps, it was an accepted part of Ottoman culture, I don't know, but one reference would have been sufficient to express this.. As much as I admired the style, knowledge of the subject matter and portrayal of Ottoman culture, the offensiveness of the buggering and the longwinded, dry narrations about details of the ancient illustrations negated most of my positive feelings about this book. The second star and a half is based solely on being impressed with the quality of mystery and the author being able to carry-off the multiple first-person POVs.. 2.5 stars","Dec 10, 2011"

1108123,Bettie,"Re-read via BBC:. BBC blurb -. The novel is a complicated mixture of murder mystery, fairy tale and exploration of the medieval world of the Turkish miniaturist painter.. The novel begins - surreally - from the point of view of the murdered man; his body thrown down the bottom of a well, he waits for this death to be discovered. The story is then taken up by a myriad of characters, which include a coin and a horse, as well as the colour Red itself. They recount a chapter at least each - in fact this book has twenty narrators and yet, as James Naughtie and readers testify, it is a page-turner.. My Name is Red is the most popular of Pamuk's in the English speaking world, due he says to the whodunnit element, but also to the global appeal of the art.. Orhan Pamuk discloses how as a young man he longed to be a painter, and so as a successful writer, it was a natural progression to write about the joys of painting, and to explore how an artist feels as their hands move across the page.. His reputation as the funny man of his family is also in evidence. Despite his intellectual credentials, humour is an important tool for him. He says he doesn't like writing a serious book, and if the reader isn't smiling when he reads his work, then he feels guilty.. It doesn't work so well outside of the paper version - it is the footnotes that hold the clues, so I urge you to engage in the traditional manner: comfy chair, fireside, glass of wine, and the paper book on your lap.","Apr 23, 2008"
33119635,Neil,"The main theme of this book is the threatened ""westernisation"" of Ottoman art, but it also includes a murder mystery and a love story. There are some long passages about the differences between the two artistic movements and some long philosophical/religious discussions. But these are interspersed with chapters that progress both the love story and murder mystery. For me, the middle of the book got a bit weighed down with the art discussions, but it is undoubtedly a book that gives someone like me from a western background and with little knowledge of eastern art plenty to think about.. It's not the simplest book in the world to read. Each chapter is narrated in the first person but by one of, I think, 12 different narrators. It is also self-consciously a book in several places with the narrator directly addressing the reader. Some of the narrators are not human. So, it can be difficult to keep track of exactly who is talking, but if you keep on top of that, then the format works well in giving you a variety of perspectives on the developing stories. I like the almost throwaway comment towards the end that we maybe shouldn't rely completely on the person who has pulled the story together!. A though-provoking read that was only spoiled for me by being a bit long-winded in the middle section.","Nov 06, 2016"
28134808,Nabilah Firdaus,"Work of art. A remarkable postmodern novel about late middle age Ottoman Empire, specifically in art. This book wasn't easy to read, honestly. It's richly written, multi-layered, full of philosophical and historical discussion. It is a curious mix of overaching murder mystery, religion, Islamic art and its miniaturists, and Western invasions of art and technology.The differences between Western Christian and Islamic perceptions of art and aesthetics covered in this book were certainly interesting and beautiful. It's also a tale of love in its various hues - between a father and a daughter, a mother and her children, a master and his students, and between friends. I especially like the way the story is narrated. It uses the first person view from different characters and even objects in the story. The tree, the dog, the coin, the horse, the Satan (I love this one the most). Elegant and fascinating symbolism. Recommended; this book would primarily appeal to admirers of art and historical fiction.. P/S: Need to read Umberto Eco's The Name of The Rose because I have been told that My Name Is Red bears many resemblances to the book.","Jun 23, 2018"
5041353,Jim,"I read this book over a period of several months. I don't think it is a book to be read quickly but one to be sipped slowly like a good cognac. Pamuk's style is very different to Western authors. This is a dense, atmospheric book, which demands a high level of patience and attention from the reader, perhaps mirroring the patience of the Turkish miniaturists illustrating the book celebrating the Sultan's life. Black Effendi, newly returned from exile, is set the task of finding the murderer of one of the illustrators by his uncle, for whom the victim was working when he was killed. Written in the first person, with multiple narratives, this is a book full of unreliable witnesses, the first narrator is strangely a corpse at the bottom of a well (Elegant Effendi) and as the various stories of the narrators unfold, the truth slowly emerges. It would have been nice to have some illustrations in the book, though the pictures Pamuk conjures in the reader's mind are vivid.","Aug 25, 2011"
115473,Siria,"A triumph of hype over substance, I thought. I'm not sure whether this is because of Pamuk himself, or whether the astonishingly stiff and formal style of the narrative can be attributed to the translator, but I was very much underwhelmed by this. The aspects of the novel which covered the differences between Western Christian and Islamic perceptions of art and aesthetics were certainly interesting; there were also some moments of true inventiveness and creativity, such as the chapters which were narrated from the point of view of a sketch of a dog, or the colour red. For the most part, though, I found the characters unengaging, flat and irritating, with Pamuk liking to show off, almost, through them. It's a very uneven mix of dialogue, plot, history and theology, and while not a bad novel, per se, I really don't think I'll ever be coming back to it.","Jun 05, 2007"

59510944,Anima,"‘Four years after I first left Istanbul, while traveling through the endless steppes, snow-covered mountains and melancholy cities of Persia, carrying letters and collecting taxes, I admitted to myself that I was slowly forgetting the face of the childhood love I’d left behind. With growing panic, I tried desperately to remember her, only to realize that despite love, a face long not seen finally fades. During the sixth year I spent in the East, traveling or working as a secretary in the service of pashas, I knew that the face I imagined was no longer that of my beloved. Later, in the eighth year, I forgot what I’d mistakenly called to mind in the sixth, and again visualized a completely different countenance. In this way, by the twelfth year, when I returned to my city at the age of thirty-six, I was painfully aware that my beloved’s face had long since escaped me.. ..... The pickle seller who passionately informed me about the cleric from Erzurum said that the counterfeit coins—the new ducats, the fake florins stamped with lions and the Ottoman coins with their ever-decreasing silver content—that flooded the markets and bazaars, just like the Circassians, Abkhazians, Mingarians, Bosnians, Georgians and Armenians who filled the streets, were dragging us toward an absolute degradation from which it would be difficult to escape. I was told that scoundrels and rebels were gathering in coffeehouses and proselytizing until dawn; that destitute men of dubious character, opium-addicted madmen and followers of the outlawed Kalenderi dervish sect, claiming to be on Allah’s path, would spend their nights in dervish houses dancing to music, piercing themselves with skewers and engaging in all manner of depravity, before brutally fucking each other and any boys they could find.‘","Mar 31, 2019"
5571752,Hafizz Nasri,"This book is lengthy and freaking detailed- I honestly had to re-read few chapters at the beginning cause I'm quite clueless with the story line at first.. In love with the writings anyway. Love how Pamuk separated each character to each chapter. I got myself a different vision every time, perspectives and those feels (especially during Shekure's chapters). Question and puzzle, a corpse lying inside a well memorizing his life and the murderer who did it to him, and how the story goes revealing details of each, vividly.. Story telling was done impressively, quite imaginary actually, I didn't expect myself to love reading about master miniaturists past and current (to the book scene) history-- those stories of Hüsrev and Shirin and the famous Persian painter Bihzad were really magnificent. I love the part where Black went to visit Butterfly, Stork and Olive asking them questions and got himself a bunch of stories about signature and style, painting and time as well as blindness and memory (this was my favorite). It was lovely to know few secrets and scandals and the exploration of these miniaturist's artworks.. Most interestingly, Pamuk gave life to certain objects/drawings during the story ride it gave me chills when I read it. My most favorite would be the gold coin and horse (and you get 'death' and 'Satan' as well). As non-human narrators it gave soul to this book, along the journey I could see how it was all related to each other, in such a way, so beautifully.. A living picture of Istanbul in year of 1950s, rich representation of Ottoman Empire, story of miniaturists, a murder mystery with love and friendship in between, and its astonishing finding. I was actually right about the murderer but later I thought I was wrong cause the story suddenly playing hints and such that I go ah damn it who the heck are you!. What a great reading journey (minus the clueless me at the beginning), my first Pamuk anyway and love it. ""I bring my color to the page, it's as if I command the world to 'Be!' Yes, those who cannot see would deny it, but the truth is I can be found everywhere.""","Jul 26, 2017"
11351200,Leslie,"John Lee gives an excellent narration for this historical fiction novel.. I knew a small amount about the 16th century Ottoman Empire so found the dispute between traditional Islamic artistic style and the 'new' Frankish style of more realistic imagery fascinating. Some might not care for the way the story is told from many perspectives (including a corpse in the opening chapter, a dog and a counterfeit coin) but I liked the way each narrator gives a different side of life at this time in Istanbul. And being a mystery buff, I liked the way the murderer gave his parts with subtle clues but I was still guessing right up to the end!. What was less to my taste (but an important part of the book) was the sometimes lengthy discussions about various famous (?) artists and their works & how art fit into the Muslim religion. These sections would have been better for me in written (rather than audio) form - the Arabic and Turkish names were sometimes difficult to identify and remember (and I can't flip back and refresh my memory with a digital audiobook the way I could in print or even ebook form).","Nov 13, 2016"
31789152,Sikata,"I am so fortunate to be red! I'm fiery. I'm strong. I know men take notice of me and that I cannot be resisted. Any art lovers out there? More specifically, art historians? Then welcome to your next read. Set in sixteenth century Istanbul, this book elicits the power and significance of art and books. The capability to illustrate something that incites love, sadness, happiness, devotion, lust, jealousy and anger that provoked wars and what not. The work of many renowned illustrators like Bizhad have been laid out in detail.. The book starts a tad slow for my taste but then it had me wrapped up in it's pages. The book keeps you guessing who the murderer is till the very end even with the author taking us on a stroll into the very dark crevices his of mind (maybe the multiple unrelated stories served the purpose of keeping us off track? 🤔). Contrary to what is commonly believed, all murderers are men of extreme faith rather than unbelievers. The inference of religion by people and tarnishing them altogether isn't new. This way the book connects history with present day too. The book is quite detailed to be an illustration in itself only through words.. I admired Shekure's strength and wit. Though she does come across as harsh at times, she just didn't have any other choice. The hardship of being a widowed mother in a patriarchal society is understandable. While Black was just a poor lady caught in the web of murder and deception to attain the love of his life. It's very 'channa mereya' in the beginning 😁 (me being Desi). That's basically all I can say for now having just finished this book. I took off a star for certain parts which didn't deem necessary. It caused the story to drag a bit.. An illustration that does not complement a story, in the end, will become but a false idol. Since we cannot possibly believe in an absent story, we will naturally begin believing in the picture itself","Apr 14, 2019"
4277669,Caitlin,"“My Name is Red” is a remarkable postmodern novel about the late middle age Ottoman Empire. It is told in a claustrophobic way through the personas of some 14 narrators. Pamuk weaves an intricate murder mystery through these narrators to tell a somewhat incestuous story of Islamic miniaturists, Western invasions of art and technology, a tortured love story and the overarching murder that ties everything and everyone together.. There are four artists working on a secret book for the Sultan in celebration of the 1,000th year of the Hajj (the start of the Muslim calendar). Elegant, Stork, Olive, and Butterfly. Elegant is murdered in the first chapter and the rest of the book is about discovering why he was murdered and who the murderer was. The only thing the reader knows is that it is a fellow artist because the murder says so in his chapters. Some of the narrators are extremely unreliable by telling lies and then admitting that they were lying, etc. It is frustrating at times but adds to the mystery.. There is also a love story. Aside from the miniaturists, the other main characters are Enishte, who the Sultan hires to make the book, his daughter Shekure and his nephew Black. Black is in love with Shekure and wants to marry her but she has a husband who is presumed dead as he did not come back from the Persian war, four years previous. I had sympathy for Shekure’s situation, because of the conservative nature of Ottoman law and Islamic law, she is considered the property of her husband and she cannot get a divorce because there is no proof he is dead. This is keeping her in the grips of her creepy brother-in-law who is obsessed with her. But I could not sympathize with her as a person. She may have been in an impossible situation but she plays with Black’s heart and manipulates him, as well as everyone else around her. Still, the argument can be made that her feminine wiles are the only thing keeping her and her children safe. At times her story is moving, at other times it is distracting from the rest of the novel.. The heart of the novel is not really about the murder or detective work at all. It is about art, its value, its meaning, how it should be made, etc. The brilliance of Pamuk’s novel is that it reveals explicitly but poetically why there is a clash between Western and Islamic mores when it comes to freedom of expression and art. The Ottoman and Islamic way of life is threatened by the encroachment of the “Frankish” way of art. Enishte had seen Venetian paintings and wanted to learn art their way. But to the Muslims this is abhorrent. This is the source of the strife in the novel, the very reason Elegant is murdered.. It brings to mind the murders that have happened in recent months and years when Mohammad is depicted, particularly when he is being mocked. Pamuk uses his characters to explain to the Western reader why portraits, the use of perspective, and having a distinctive style are considered blasphemous to the Islamic mind. It is a true culture clash, the West has always surrounded itself with true depictions and material objects, the Muslims see that as man being arrogant, trying to outdo Allah, the only true Creator. For the Persian artists that the Ottoman artists admire and copy, the highest form of art is when they inevitably go blind and then paint from memory, that is when they are closest to Allah’s vision of the world. It is a way for them to be inline with their God. This mystical idea of blindness was intriguing and terrifying, I fear going blind, I could not imagine craving it, or even deliberately causing it because of a spiritual connection. But that is how much their cultural style of art means to them. While it seems insane in the modern day West, understanding the true significance of what a representation of Mohammad means to a Muslim, explains why violence erupts when individual violent-minded people are provoked.. Pamuk is not condoning this, nor am I. I think he is just explaining it. The deeper I got into the book the more sardonic the tone seemed. He is critical of the Western way and the Islamic way. This book feels like the beginning of a conversation about the way Muslims gets meaning out of art and life. It is also a historical novel about how European influences really were one of the downfalls of the Ottomans, they couldn’t keep up technologically or with the modern way of thinking.. It is a very entertaining novel with a satisfying, if somewhat melancholy, ending. But the real treasure is learning about a whole different way to look at the age old question, “does art imitate life, or life imitate art?”","Apr 19, 2015"
1758411,Lisa,"My Name is Red. is another book that indulges my interest in illuminated illustration. I bought it ages ago when it won the IMPAC prize in 2003, but although Pamuk has since become one of those authors whose books I try always to read, until now I had never got round to reading the one that made him famous to ordinary readers in the Anglosphere. It’s taken me ages to read it, because I as-good-as read it twice, backtracking over the chapters as I fitted the pieces of the puzzle together but also as I formed a more coherent understanding of the principles of Ottoman art in the 16th century.. The novel is a murder mystery in the style of Umberto Eco’s. The Name of the Rose. or Iain Pears’. An Instance of the Fingerpost. but it’s also a love story and a meditation on a transitional period in Ottoman art. At the same time it also explores one of Pamuk’s central preoccupations: the contest between modernity and tradition; and between the West and Islam. He does this through an exploration of the Islamic art of miniatures, setting his novel among master miniaturists under the leadership of Master Osman, a character based on the real life Nakkaş Osman, the chief miniaturist of the Ottoman region in the 16th century.. When I visited the Alhambra in Granada, I wasn’t all that excited about Islamic art because representation of the human form was not allowed and my interest waned after a few chambers of what looked to me like endless repetitions. But actually Ottoman art covered a vast area, and it was influenced by Persian and Chinese art, as well as the Franks and the Venetians with whom the Ottomans were consorting as they conquered bits and pieces of Europe. There was also a significant difference between public art, and the exquisite. private. artworks commissioned by successive Sultans who liked, as rulers do, to acquire self-aggrandising artworks that feature their importance. So it’s not at all surprising that when the Sultan of Pamuk’s novel caught up with the idea of Renaissance portraiture from Genoa and Venice, he liked the idea of a portrait, accompanied by items significant in his life as a demonstration of his power and majesty..

Invitation to World Literature. , which dedicated an entire lesson to this book. Several university literature professors as well as the translator and the author himself enthusiastically talked it up and, after 30 minutes, I was more than eager to read “My Name is Red”. I was certain I would LOVE this murder mystery set in 16th-century Istanbul with a cast of characters consisting mostly of artists.. The literary devise of having the story told by a number of different characters, beginning with the corpse of the murdered artist and including a dog, a picture of a tree, a coin, Death, Satan and even the color red, seemed to be a winning formula. The writing was beautiful and I immediately began highlighting sentence after sentence so I could come back to read them and share them with friends. For example:. “I don't want to be a tree; I want to be its meaning.”. “Painting is the silence of thought and the music of sight.”. “A letter doesn't communicate by words alone. A letter, just like a book, can be read by smelling it, touching it and fondling it. Thereby, intelligent folk will say, 'Go on then, read what the letter tells you!' whereas the dull-witted will say, 'Go on then, read what he's written!”. But, although I was in awe of the profound snippets of philosophy and social commentary, I soon lost my enthusiasm for the “story”, and at the 40% mark, I still didn’t care about any of the characters.. I’m not giving up on “My Name is Red” completely, because there are parts that are brilliant. Maybe I’m just not in the proper frame of mind for this right now, so I’ll shelve it for now and give it another chance in a few months.. P.S.

My name is Red is all the more philosophical than it is mysterious, all the more informative than it is entertaining..or one more than the other. The book deals with the life of miniaturists who struggled between adopting the styles of their old masters and Venetian artists and how this very conflict led the miniaturists to succumb to a slow death of their art leaving the remnants to be left forgotten in the realm of time. Apart from many reasons why this book has been more than an exciting novel for me is, being a contemporary work as it is, it has helped me to refresh my faith in a beautiful, inspirational way. I couldn't have had a more liberal experience of relating Koran's verses in many life long situations as described by the author. My favorite being the narrative of a dog who sounds out from Koran his miseries and sorrows especially since dog is generally abhorred in an Islamic society as a filthy animal. The tout ensemble of characters has been as usual astounding and the protracted narrative as directed by the author individually for each character led to a verisimilitude of courtroom where reader is the judge or in a similar way God judges us all..

1927524,Nick,"I have been late to join the Orhan Pamuk bandwagon. In fact, I suspect I never will. I approached “My Name is Red” with an affection for the historical novel, as well as for novels with many narrators. “My Name is Red” makes me question both. Technically, it is virtuosic. It effectively evokes fifteenth century Istanbul, and makes an important plot device—and more important, makes intelligible—the complex debate of Islamic belief and art, especially regarding the representation of human beings. It asks big questions about art and history and religion. There is even a murder mystery, although an anemic one, and the fulfillment of a great lost love hangs in the balance. It has modernist tricks galore—chapters or parts of them are narrated by death, a coin, by the color red (hence, the title), a tree, a dog, a horse (rather, the idea of a horse, since that particular narrator ruminates on being depicted over the centuries), Satan, and a severed head.

This book has the capability to take the readers from ""wow"", with its sheer brilliance ,to ""duh"", thrusting them into plunging ennui, in matter of pages.. What this book is about - a passionate love story or just a tale of lust and selfishness, a suspenseful murder mystery or a predictable drag, on art and artistry or painter's dilemma - is hard to decide.. Undoubtedly, it created an impact on my mind with its unique narration style, where men, animals, objects and concepts, each become a different voice to tell the tale from their 'vantage point'. Also, it introduced me to the Islamic world of the medieval period and Istanbul (how I wish to visit that city now) in particular.. But it failed to ignite a spark in me to have great appreciation for art and miniatures, which probably was one of its intent, courtesy of its dry and repetitive writing..

Very odd to have someone proclaim his praises to God or Allah in this case, and then recall how lovely it was to bugger the pretty boys.. The book is told through the eyes of several narrators - the miniaturists, their master, some of the subjects of the illustration, a matchmaker, the love interest of one of the Black, her father and the murderer (who is also one of the above). Thank heavens for the sections from Esther, Shekure and Satan et. al because the others are so tedious with their bantering about whether an artist should have a style and about blindness that I wanted to take an elaborately jeweled pin and jab it in my (well, maybe not mine - but somebody’s) eyes.","Oct 02, 2007"

1188122,Kara Babcock,"This is the second work of historical fiction I’ve read in a month that has a colour in its title and features art as a significant component of its story. The other,. Sacré Bleu. , was an irreverent “comedy d’art” by Christopher Moore.. My Name is Red. definitely isn’t that. Good thing I like to read widely!. My Name is Red. opens with the voice of a dead man. Elegant Effendi describes the sensations of knowing he is dead, of his spirit decoupling from his body. He hopes his murderer will be found and brought to justice (the more creative the better). From there, Orhan Pamuk goes on to hop perspectives every chapter, weaving a story of magic and mystery in sixteenth-century Istanbul. Centred around a workshop of miniaturists who are working on a somewhat controversial book for the Sultan,. My Name is Red. dips into some of the questions raised in the sixteenth century as the Ottoman Empire continued to coexist uneasily next to the Christian nations of Western Europe. The time is the past and the setting is, as always, that battleground between change and tradition.. This book reminds me a lot of. The Name of the Rose. . Superficially they have so many similarities: both are translations, one from Turkish and one from Italian. Both are set in the past and involve a murder mystery. Both are written in a style that is, if not challenging, then definitely demanding of one’s full attention. Beyond the surface, though, the striking similarities continue: both of these novels are about the tension between different schools of thought. In. The Name of the Rose. it’s the growing chasm between science and religion, between the empirical principles of Bacon and Occam and the spiritual communion of the Franciscans and Dominicans. In. My Name is Red. it’s the clash between the older, traditional ways of depicting people in Islamic art and the new style imported from Venice—a style that, some worry, comes too close to the real thing. And in both these novels, the murders are inextricably linked to these questions of style, change, and tradition.. I can see why many people express frustration over this book’s narration. It’s not the easiest book to read. Translated from Turkish,. My Name is Red. doesn’t always have the same kind of unity and coherence that a novel originally written in English might have. Moreover, Pamuk has very little time for dialogue. Most of the book is either description or introspection from the narrator to the reader.. My Name is Red. reminds me of a stage play. In each scene, several actors would be in tableaux while the narrator of the scene delivers an extensive monologue. Then, with a flourish, he or she triggers the action, the other actors unfreeze, and the plot drags forward for a few minutes before the narrator re-assumes control. Although i understand why some people see the narrators as flat, I thought the moments when they comment on their actions, their drawings or letter-writing or courting, were quite confessional. Just the character and I in a musty, dark room, as the character hurriedly scribbles out the journal of their last days. One of them is a murderer ….. Thanks to the way Pamuk structures the novel, attempting to discover the identity of the murderer is half the fun. The murderer narrates both as himself and as his ordinary miniaturist alter ego, always careful never to reveal anything about his actions as a miniaturist that would shed light on his identity. So, for example, Pamuk has each of the three suspect miniaturists tell three parables labelled Aliph, Bet, Djim, allowing the murderer to refer to these stories without revealing which miniaturist he is. But the clues are there, getting louder as the novel approaches the climax and the identity of the murderer is revealed. I was sure it was one miniaturist pretty early on—and I was wrong. So it goes.. The miniaturists’ chapters are also very interesting looks at the ongoing debate regarding Islamic versus Western art. Is it sacrilege to paint in the Frankish style? What. is. style, anyway? Is it sacrilege to have one’s own style, rather than labouring to faithfully reproduce the old pieces as flawlessly as possible? True flawlessness, of course, just like true creativity, is the domain of Allah and not something a mere human artist could achieve. These questions spill over beyond the miniaturists’ chapters, however, and into the concurrent love story between Shekure and Black and the murder mystery itself. The ideas Pamuk juggles are particularly appropriate to the context of the story, but they are timeless and still relevant today.. Above all else, Pamuk manages to convey how. personal. the process of making and rendering art can be. Making art is a thoughtful, time-consuming activity that can be as emotionally draining as it is physically. The crises of faith experienced in. My Name is Red. are all too real. They happen as a result of the expression of self necessary for art to be possible: what you make, and how you make it, says something about yourself and your convictions, what you believe and the values you hold dear. To set that down on paper, in ink, in stone, on canvas, for others to view and discuss and rip apart … it’s a little terrifying. Worse still, in the act of such creation, you begin to think about these beliefs and sometimes even question them—or, through the influence of other creators, you realize that there are other sets of beliefs out there. Which ones are true, better, practical, enriching, etc.? Does it even matter?. So, you know, art is serious business. Serious enough in this case that someone was willing to kill Elegant Effendi for questioning if what they were doing was compatible with the wishes of Allah. On one hand, such actions seem like the same old, same old internecine and destructive effects of organized religion—but that would be a disingenuous and uncharitable evaluation. For on the other hand, the conflict in. My Name is Red. is less about religion and more about personal values that hinge upon the intersection of history, politics, faith, and art.. It took me a while to read. My Name is Red. , partly because I did so while moving to another country and partly because of its heavily stylized narration. But read it I did. While it did not necessarily excite me or enthrall me in the same way. The Name of the Rose. did, its meditations on the nature of art and artistry, style and sacrilege and sacrifice, are still interesting. It is a deep and thoughtful book; as long as you are willing to spend the time and effort on it, it is also a rewarding one.","Aug 23, 2012"
8604691,Steve Middendorf,"I took me two full 3 week loans and an email saying we're about to start discussing our next book to get me to finish it. Why? I’m a fast reader. This is favoured subject matter and an author who made me fall in love with Melvet, the Boza seller. Why couldn’t I stay with this book? Was there a message I didn’t want to hear?. I have been of the mind that much that is wrong with the East can be blamed on the West. Exploitation, colonialism, hegemony, militarism, orientalism, Sykes-Picot, the Balfour Declaration, the Mordad Coup, the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq and other forms of meddling have been in my diet.. Now a little known Turkish art historian, Orhan Pamuk (who also writes books) has opened the door marked c-d. Cognitive dissonance. Pamuk introduces us to the world of the Islamic court painters. It’s 1576. Suleyman the Magnificient had laid siege to Vienna and had captured Baghdad from the Persians. Istanbul was at its heights, but a cultural war was raging. Whose art was best? The Franks (Venetians) on the left, or the Persians on the right? Pamuk is very crafty-- he studied to be an artist after all. And like the professor who preys on college sophomores, he makes us fall in love with Islamic miniature art. This is art history in words. He shows us no paintings. Our fellow travellers will supply… or google it. And we do fall in love.. While a murder mystery goes on in the background, we see a society of artists, dominated by faith, confront their enemies of the easel. Because we are in love, we are greatly sympathetic. Pamuk the subversive! We do not see the work of Leonardo or Raphael or Michelangelo. No one supplies it! But we do get the local reactions: to Bellini and Titian and the portrait artists of Venice, the infidels who:. “...had discovered painting techniques with which they could distinguish any one man from another—without relying on his outfit or medals, just by the distinctive shape of his face.”. I noticed ReemK10 liked Fionnuala's review of Alison Cole's Italian Renaissance Courts: Art, Pleasure and Power. It was a lovely review wasn't it? I was struck by the connections and the overlaps between the two books. Both deal with art of course, but come at their subject from competing cultures and ideologies. (Rebecca Johnson's Foreword to Leg Over Leg describes an active, seesaw, cultural competition.) Alison Cole’s author page lists two books: Color and Perspective. How much fun it would be to technically compare the art of Turkey and the art of the Italian Renaissance for the same period. Edward Said, cover your eyes. As we trace the murderers of Black Effendi, the architecture in the story gradually deteriorates, and so too does our perception of Islamic art. The author seems to say that while Persian art may be better than the Turkish art, Italian art is of a different, more advanced nature. There is no competing with Renaissance man, freed from the strictures and politics of religious belief. I had the thought that my enjoyment of this book would have been much improved by the inclusion of examples of miniaturist art. Then I went to ReemK10's review of the book and found all these sublime miniaturist plates. How lovingly crafted! Thank you. Some reviews are as beautiful as their subject matter. I am in awe of the valuable content my friends leave behind here.","Nov 15, 2018"
220791,Lena,"My Name is Red is set in sixteenth-century Istanbul. There, a group of master miniaturists have been secretly commissioned to create a book using painting techniques from Western art. The book is nearing completion when one of the miniaturists suddenly turns up dead.. The story of the murder investigation unfolds slowly alongside that of a romance between another miniaturist who is trying to solve it and the daughter of the man responsible for commissioning the book. Each chapter is told in a different voice, beginning with the corpse of the murdered man and moving through many characters including all of the other miniaturists, the daughter, her lover, and several of the illustrations that populate the books themselves.. This is an ornate, elaborate read, one in which the author spends a great deal of time meticulously describing the paintings that are being worked on and viewed throughout the course of the story. There is also a fair amount of philosophical discussion about the nature of visual art and in particular the differences between the Islamic styles in which the miniaturists were accustomed to working and the new ""Venetian"" style that many considered blasphemous. These latter sections were among the most enjoyable for me in the book.. While some parts of the story were quite interesting to me, I found that overall this book was not to my taste. At first, the author's meticulous attention to detail felt luxurious and opulent. As the tale progressed, however, I found myself losing patience with his pages and pages of elaborate description; there are only so many ways to describe a painting, and his insistence on doing so repeatedly slowed the story down considerably. In addition, the constant changing of voices left me feeling detached from the events described, as no sooner had I gotten involved with one character's perspective than I was forced to change to another. This might have worked better if the characters themselves had been more sympathetic, but for the most part, the people who populated this story were not individuals I particularly liked.. I finished the book mostly to discover the resolution of the murder and the love story, which was satisfying enough. But I ultimately didn't enjoy the journey as much as I'd expected to given the book's promising combination of elements. If Goodreads had half stars, I'd probably rate it 2.5; as it stands, I'd recommend it mainly for readers with an interest in visual art, Turkish history, and a great deal of patience.","Oct 24, 2008"
6491886,Sarah Goodwin,"Worst book of 2014 so far.. I had to read this for class and found myself wondering what the point of it all was. The so called 'thrilling murder mystery' element is drawn out and dull, because we don't really know the murder victim, or the killer sufficiently well to be invested in justice or understanding. Black, who is pretty much the main character, is dull and fairly two dimensional - he wants the girl of his dreams and doesn't want to get executed or tortured.. The book would also be half the length if it wasn't filled with repetative 'lessons' on style, blindness and the drawing of horses. Obviously someone thought that was worth it winning the biggest prize out there, but for regular readers, all this 'meaningful' stuff is just a delaying tactic for a semi-interesting story. Especially when you know that there are 3 artists, who will all be telling three stories in the next few chapters, my attention wandered far away.. Aside from all this, there is something basically uninteresting about the prose style, which is monotonous and often uses repeated words in the same sentance.. In the end, the reveal of the murderer left me thinking 'so what?' there is no 'love story' to speak of, and I'm starting to think whoever wrote the blurb never finished, or even picked up the book.","Mar 06, 2014"
53055819,Abbie | ab_reads,"This month Alex and I headed to Turkey with Orhan Pamuk's 'My Name Is Red', and I think it's safe to say we weren't particularly enamoured with this book.... But I don't want to be all doom and gloom because there were some parts that I liked about the book! The narration was fun, as it flits from several different perspectives with short chapters, which helps alleviate the heaviness. Some of my favourite chapters were narrated by a coin, a tree, and a corpse, and I also liked the chapters narrated by the women of the story. There were also some gorgeous details about the art and culture of 16th century Istanbul.. Unfortunately, too much of this book was detail, so much so that the story was just lost in a sea of excruciatingly precise descriptions of illustrations and art techniques. It dragged. I found myself skimming so many passages just to get back to the story, which isn't what you want. I also found it difficult to overcome some of the cultural differences that came with the time and country, such as how women were treated as possessions and had little or no voice.. Overall, I think I'd recommend this book to you only if you had a specific interest in Turkish history or the history of illumination and illustration.","Sep 14, 2017"
4810137,Arda,"Work of art.. I am a corpse.. I am a dog.. A tree.. A murderer.. A silver coin.. A woman..... Miniturists, Islam, death, after-death, murder, mystery. The book is a MYSTERY.. Other themes: Blindness, East/West, Signing name.. Loaded with stories especially from Turkey and Persia. It has some funny parts too. I especially enjoyed the dog's defense from animosity towards dogs in Islam, the coin's perspective, and Satan's ideas. The ending was strange/daring (a blow-job?!) and Shekure - one of the characters, turns out to be talking about her second younger son Orhan: ""For the sake of a delightful and convincing story, there isn't a lie Orhan wouldn't deign to tell."".

14943717,Indrani Sen,"A book I feel ill-equipped to review. I loved the story about the daily life of miniaturists in Istanbul. Their dedication to their art, the conflict of their work with their religion, their day-to-day competitions with each other are extremely well depicted. The love story left me slightly cold though it is real enough, being full of frailty and manipulations. The mystery again was, for me, not that gripping.

900800,Inderjit Sanghera,"‘My Name is Red’ is an exploration of the aesthetic differences between Western and Islamic art and culture, masquerading by that most Western of literary concepts; the detective story. ‘My Name is Red’, however, constantly subverts murder mystery tropes; the murder victims form two of the many narrators yet they never reveal who the murderer is, the murderer is also a narrator and he constantly talks to and goads the reader-Pamuk is able to synthesise post-modern literary techniques such as metafiction and unreliable narrators with a story that explores the art of Ottoman miniature, an antiquated, though sophisticated, form of art, though one which rejected the ideals of realism and individuality of Western renaissance painting, in favour of a kind of religious abstraction which would allow the viewers to glimpse how god conceives the world.. The novel is set during a harsh winter in Istanbul and Pamuk is able to capture its verdant atmosphere, the steady somnolent fall of snow which engulfs Istanbul echoes the iridescent beauty of Istanbul; from the incandescent moonlight to the suffocating alley-ways, many of Pamuk’s descriptions read like miniaturist paintings;. “Every detail, the finely wrought wall, window and frame ornamentation, the curves and circular designs in the red rug, the colour of the silent screen emanating from your clamped throat and the yellow and purple flowers embroidered with incredible finesse and vigour on the magnificent quilt upon which the bare and vile foot of your murderer mercilessly steps as he ends your life, all of these details serve the same purpose: while augmenting the beauty of the painting, they remind you just how exquisite are the room in which you will soon die and the world you will soon leave. The indifference of the painting’s beauty and of the world to your death, in fact of your being totally alone in death despite the presence of your wife, this is the inescapable meaning that escapes you.”. Pamuk not only captures the other-worldly and fantastical nature of miniaturist paintings, but also the symbolised which is deeply rooted in them and which branches out via the myriad of colours which form the basis of the paintings; from the green, blue and reds which dominate the miniaturist paintings, the contours and shades of colour form the basis of the surreal beauty which blazes forth from the miniaturist paintings, the colour red is resplendent with meaning, with mellifluous and yet murderous, it even serves as a narrator in the novel;. “Colour is the touch of an eye, music to the deaf, a word out of the darkness. Because I’ve listened to souls whispering-like the susurrus of the wind-from book to book and object to object for tens of thousands of years, allow me to say that my touch resembles the touch of angels. Part of me, the serious half, calls out to your vision while the mirthful half soars through the air with your glances.”. Colours beautify the world bringing us closer to Allah’s vision of the world, not via the naturalistic recreations of the world which dominated Western painting, which the Ottoman miniaturists felt were a simulacrum of superficial impressions, an insult to the munificence of Allah, but via the intensely emotional and spiritual messages behind the miniaturist paintings, paintings in which the miniaturists would possess such perfect memories and technique that they could recreate paintings even after going blind.. “Oh how might I adequately describe the hues I saw during this exquisite journey? The whole world was made of colour, everything was colour. Just as I sensed the force separating me from all other beings and objects consisted of colour, I now knew that it was colour itself that had affectionately embraced me and bound me to the world. I saw orange-hued skies, beautiful leaf-green bodies, brown eggs and legendary sky-blue horses. The world was faithful to the illustrations and legends I’d avidly scrutinised over the years. I beheld creation with awe and surprise as if for the first time, but also as if it’d somehow emerged from my memory. What I called “memory” contained an entire world: with time spread out infinitely before me in both directions, I understood how the world as I first experienced it could persist afterward as memory. As I died surrounded by this festival of colour, I also discovered why I felt so relaxed, as if I’d been liberated from a strait-jacket: From now on nothing was restricted, and I had unlimited time and space in which to experience all eras and places.”. Repetition and memory formed the cornerstone of miniaturist paintings, paintings were rarely signed as one painting was often the collective effort of several miniaturist painters, and individuality and originality were frowned upon as being discordant with the principles of Ottoman minitaurism, which emphasised the achievement of technical perfection via the endless repetition of the works of old masters. How then, does Pamuk reconcile the originality and individuality of his own art with the ossified and parochial nature of Ottoman minitaurism? Perhaps that is not his purpose, in many ways he wishes to bridge the gap between Western and Arabic art and uses a Western art form to celebrate and give voice to the unique and fantastical beauty of minitaurism, whose beauty was in danger of being lost forever in the vestiges of time, but which Pamuk is able to immortalise, just like the miniaturist painters were sought to immortalise the love between Hüsrev and Shirin.","Apr 10, 2013"
5541253,Amgad Muhammad,"CHAPTER 60. I’M NOT A DOORKNOCKER. Even though my label states that I am, I am definitely not! Another lie by those who see only through their own I’s, but a man who realizes how truth doesn't need to be proven will surely understand the difference between me and a doorknocker. See, my silver disk, coated with a carefully chosen shade of copper and embroidered with a delicate Arabic calligraphy that circulates my center as if it was humbly doing. tawaf. around my flower-shaped handle, might give you the idea of a doorknocker. And from where I’m fixed now, upon a white plain wall, I can understand how a thought like this might come to be. But let’s put me back in my original context.. I don’t belong to a museum wall, I belong to an Islamic complex door. I was fixed to a gorgeous copper door that got shipped to another museum. We all knew this day was coming, that after hundreds of years of unity and cohesion we would get ripped apart by western scholars exactly the way the gold-and-blue. Meshkahs. were ripped from the gold-and-blue ceiling of the Sultan Barquq’s. Madrasah. next door. I've heard my friend got shipped to the museum of David Collection, apparently he was accused of being a doorknob in Sultan Barquq’s Madrasah. I pray for him.. My complex had a Madrasah where gifted Muslims learned Islam and medicine, opposite to a. Bimarestan. were patients got utmost care. With a mosque in between, Muslims would lean on me to take off their worldly needs, as well as their shoes, before they meet Allah and ask for his forgiveness. How I miss the scent of Musk in the old men’s hands when their touch used to glisten my day. But everything went black in the 20's when I got locked in a box and shipped here to Saint Louis art museum. My question to you is this: If I’m truly an exquisite doorknocker, how come no one noticed when I was gone? How come Al-Hajj Abdullah didn't notice that he could no longer hang his Sebha on me while he takes off his shoes?. On your way to the Islamic section you must have passed by the American art gallery. There, you must have stood mesmerized by the talent of a painter in depicting a vase of corn lilies and heliotrope. Remember what the tree said in the 10th chapter about the Venetian painting? “if you depicted one of the trees in this forest, a man who looked upon that painting could come here and, if he so desired, correctly select that tree from among the others”. The painting is not meant to provide you with the joy these lilies bring to butterflies or the love that this heliotrope gives to a new bride. The paint serves only one purpose, to make the painter exceptional and to make society praise its uniqueness. To worship success and achievements and to inspire others to be as unique, successful and worthy of individuals as this painter.. But a flower growing on the borders of Ibnul Qayim books is not meant to be a praise for its artist, rather a praise to the love that nourished the flower to grow. It’s a statement of how enlightening words like those of Ibnul Qayim can harness seeds of faith and turn them into flowers that remain forever grateful to the creator. While a western mind would paint as a lily the most accurate representation of a given existing lily, an eastern heart would draw, with blind eyes, the inward devotion to purity and innocence that a lily, anywhere and anytime, ought to depict.. So am I a doorknocker or am I the representation of the devotion that calligraphers, painters, craftsmen working on copper, glass and wood, architects and other hundred or so artists have come together to create? Am I a doorknocker or your first encounter to a space that cares for the wounds of bodies on the left, while on the right embraces the vulnerabilities of human intellect, and in between, embodies the peace and tranquility that a prayer in his right mind and body will experience once between the hands of the almighty healer?. When the west captivated me in this glass-box they claimed their right to narrate my story, in which they will say that I was “purchased” not stolen, and that I was waiting for my indisputable end if I was kept on that door in Cairo, that here, suffocating in this glass-box, and with the accurately adjusted air conditioner and constant brushing, I’m in a better place. What they refuse to accept as truth and arrogantly wants me to prove, is that when an eastern makes a doorknocker he sublimes to become the doorknocker.. So I’m not a doorknocker, nor its meaning. I’m my artist’s gesture to the truth.. ** 8 months later, I give the book 5 stars **","Dec 15, 2014"
2201886,Mike,"This book was fantastic; it deserves an unqualified ""5"".. I head about this book on the PBS program ""An Invitation to World Literature"" and was intrigued by the description of it and by the fact that it was modern and the living author was brought into the program. Since I knew other books in the series such as ""The Odyssey"", ""The Epic of Gilgamesh"", ""The 1000 and One Nights"", and ""Candide"" I thought it must be very good indeed. Often times such high expectations lead to a disappointment in the actual reading. I am happy to report that ""My Name is Red"" avoid such a fate.. There are some rare books that I as soon as I finish them I think about how the next time I read them I will be able to savor more of the story; its nuances, its details and off-center plots and tidbits. I was anticipating the next reading of this book even while I was only two-thirds of the way through it. It is an incredibly unorthodox book in organization and ""voice"", but at the same time a perfect tale of mystery, human feelings and history. Where else can you find a book that has a talking dog illustration, not to mention a coin or a color? I kept thinking that the word ""lavish"" would be one way to describe it. And it is lavish - it has deep passionate descriptions of illustration (aka Eastern painting) and art. Long and highly specific passages bring to life the craftsmanship and skill that went into legendary books created during the first 1,000 years of Islam.. Whether these books exist in whole or in part today does not matter. Whether the author is or is not an artistic himself does not matter. Indeed, he could have made them up completely; it does not matter. Ultimately it is only the story and how it draws us in and holds our attention that matters to the reader. I, for one, hope that much of what he presents is based in solid historical fact. To my mind that would make the tale even more poignant and compelling. But if every word was make-believe, as we once thought the Iliad was, would not diminish my respect and admiration for Mr. Pamuk. It might even increase them.. I know that not everyone will share my rating this book as a superlative work. I will look at the aggregate rankings after posting this ""review"". Sometimes I am right there with the averages, this time I can image other people not ""getting it"" and giving threes or even twos. For those people I would encourage them to give it a second chance. For every one else, I urge you to get a copy and start reading.. In the theme of ""what have I learned from this book"", I must admit that I knew that Western artists had developed the theories and techniques that created realistic portraiture and perspective. I also knew that early art (Western or Eastern) was ""flatter"" and resembled Chinese painting and illustrations (which I had become more familiar with during the past 15 years or so). What I did not put together (no matter how logical it is) was how Chinese painting and methods moved into neighboring areas and then into the ""core"" of Islamic civilization. Sometimes two plus two just does not compute.. Likewise, the ways in which Islamic artists created their own forms and format (the high horizon and drawing what Allah sees, not the ""real"" thing) were new and very interesting to me. (I am trusting here in the research and historical accuracy of the author. At least the ""Chronology"" gives weight to my belief in him.) I may not seek out a book on Miniaturists or their works any time soon, but it is a very colorful topic.. NB: I carried this book out to Wales on my last business trip and started it on the flight back (after completing two other books despite the 16-18 hour days). I have finished it (and one more if my luck holds) before flying off again. Haven't decided what's making the three week trip, yet. But if I can be ensnared so thoroughly while completely exhausted, then any normal person (book lover) will succumb by just opening the cover!","Jan 29, 2011"
708858,John,"(Apologies – this review didn’t load, somehow, a few days ago when I first posted. All that went up were the stars.). Pamuk tucks together his origami expertly. His narrative skeleton itself emerges as a fascinating combination: there's the murder of a master artist for the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople at the end of the 16th C., folded together w/ the slowly-reignited romance between the widowed Shekure & the man once infatuated w/ her, the Sultan's newly-summoned & more radical painter “Black.” Each 1st-person fold in the tale – for this is historical fiction without the usual Authorial control, historical gone subversive; everyone here speaks for themselves, & everyone slips some new piece of story as the origami goes through additional bending & creasing; there are four or five recurring speakers & a few anomalies – anyway, each protagonist, each visit & revisit to key events, contributes to the creation of cosmopolitan Constantinople (itself a storied meeting-place of the world's far corners), & to the astonishingly intense art history. “Art” in Ottoman Islam proves something over which men might kill each other, & a woman might reinvest her heart. At RED's moment in Islamic history, the hegemony of stylized miniaturism had produced masterpieces, allegories-in-paint re-dramatized by Pamuk thrillingly & wittily, but it was up against a fresh threat, namely, the naturalism out of Renaissance Italy. Even the storyteller in the local coffee-house, he & his bracing new drink as well, looms as a threat to the conservatives among the Believers. So Pamuk extends the folds of his narrative to include himself & his 21st-C. reader, since the struggle in RED between freethinkers & fundamentalists, a struggle that casts its shadow across every clue to the mystery, foreshadows the crisis within contemporary Islam. Not that the connection suffers any galumphing obviousness; it's all brilliantly tucked together. Every story-within-story contributes to resolutions quite perfect in their way, even as they leak a good deal more blood, some of it (as ever in the clash between what’s next & what’s past) innocent blood. Yet I’d say such formal elegance & intellectual grasp, praiseworthy as it is, can be found in less significant books from this man. Pamuk brought off the same sense of the wheel of history turning, & the same unsettling impression that every concluding scene is only another sliding panel, in THE WHITE CASTLE. Yet that novel doesn’t have the impact of MY NAME IS RED, not nearly, & the essential change element is the latter’s book’s powerful woman character. I’m talking about Shekure: daughter, mother, lover, poet, housewife, oracle, widow, Shiva, Savior. And more: the woman's conflicted but willing, confined but worldly, deeply pragmatic yet determined to believe in better. Shekure is the vessel by which Pamuk transcends his brainy command, his structural & stylistic gifts, to achieve a novelistic power at once postmodern & classic. And more: through Shekure he challenges the misogyny that still cripples so many believers in the religion he was born to. He urges his culture towards a more inclusive cosmology.","Aug 04, 2009"
5283293,Cbj,"*** SPOILERS ALERT ***. My Name is Red’s structure reminded me of Chaucer’s poem “The Canterbury Tales”. Each chapter is narrated by a different person or an animal or an object. While “The Canterbury Tales” involves the narration of stories that are not really connected to each other, My Name is Red is a murder mystery where the stories are interconnected and the different narratives help move the story forward.. The novel is set in 16th century Turkey where the miniaturists and religious fundamentalists are concerned about the increasing influence of Venetian and Frankish perspectives of art and life in Turkey. When the Sultan commissions an album of paintings to be made in the Venetian and Frankish styles and appoints Enishte Effendi (an artist who is sympathetic to the European style) to head the project, there is mistrust and paranoia among the miniaturists. The arrival of Black, Enishte’s nephew and his affair with the beautiful and frustrated Shekure (Enishte’s widowed daughter) leads to more intrigue and sexual jealousy. The authorities get involved when a miniaturist involved with the project and the Enishte Effendi are brutally murdered.. I was enamored by most of this novel. But like a better reviewer than me pointed out, the narrative is often paused for the verbal description of art and detailed discussions about the different perspectives of art. I found the long discussions, descriptions and perspectives of art to be repetitive and boring after a certain point. Every single narrator (except for the two females) articulates his point of view on multiple occasions about how every painting need to be made from the perspective of almighty Allah and there is no scope for individuality or signature of the artist in his work. Are these repetitive discussions meant to foreground the theme of the novel? Or are they supposed to emphasize the paranoia of the characters towards European culture? I don’t know.. While it is a murder mystery, every narrative point of view is couched within the perspectives of the different points of view about art. Even the scurrilously funny narrative from the point of view of a fake gold coin. The tone is conversational with some of the narrators addressing the reader directly.. I enjoyed the novel mainly due to the characterization of Shekure. She is a scheming but sexually frustrated woman who hugs and wrestlers with her boys when she feels lonely (there is more than a hint of incest here). Pamuk’s description of the inner life of a socially repressed 16th century Muslim woman is deliberately provocative. Some of the parables were very entertaining and meaningful.. A lot of reviewers on Goodreads seem to be of the opinion that “My Name is Red” is about the conflict between Eastern and Western perspectives about art. But I interpreted it as Orhan Pamuk’s humorous and irreverent castigation of Eastern (in this case Turkish Muslim) perspective about art which was formed by a sense of supremacism, insecurity and paranoia.","Feb 28, 2017"
33440429,Ashish,"Reading this book, my first by Orhan Pamuk, was a long time coming and the company of a read along finally made me take the plunge. What really drew me to the book in the first place was the narrative structure and the interesting first person perspective which keeps switching every chapter. It is a really amazing way to tell a story, especially one which is set in the world of art and speaks a lot about perspective in itself.. On first look, the book is a murder mystery, one which keeps tracks of a bunch of characters and follows them to unravel the murderer in the 3rd act which he has committed in the 1st act. However, as you read it, you see its much more than that. It is a wide-eyed and an in-depth look into the world of art, the miniaturists, the region and time period that was the Ottoman Empire, the cultural and religious idiosyncrasies and how indelibly intertwined that are with the art of the time. It is a really interesting perspective into what art actually means to people and how it is the representation of much more that people and animals and scenes on paper. The book provides tremendous insight into the mystical world of Islamic art and the conflicts that are at the heart of it.. More importantly, the book is a study in character work. It has some of the best and well-fleshed out characters that I have read, they are flawed and conflicted and hence very human. The presence of multiple narrators and their individual perspective helps to draw a fuller character portrayal which is one of the strengths of the book. It also manages to hint at a lot of local mythology and folklore which provides it the air of mysticism and a shroud of the exotic.. The book does a magnificent job at the use of the unreliable narrator and has excellent transitions between time and people, especially by the use of an inanimate narrator in between chapters, which provide a fly-on-the-wall, a wallflower like narrative. My only tiny grouse with the book is that it could have been edited a bit as it tends to get a bit repetitive in its tangents. Maybe it is a limitation of translating a huge book and it does actually add to the aura of the lore, but it is nonetheless an excellent read. I am eagerly waiting to pick up another book by the author to see if he can recreate the magic.","Jun 15, 2017"
51003559,Tamara Agha-Jaffar,"My Name is Red. by. Orhan Pamuk. is a whodunit mystery set in sixteenth-century Istanbul. Pamuk, the 2006 Nobel Prize Winner in Literature, takes us on a labyrinthine journey with interlocking threads of intrigue, love, rivalry, murder—all of which are interspersed with philosophical debates on the function of art and its intersection with religion.. The narrative progresses through the first-person point of view of multiple narrators, some of whom are startling. The opening chapter is in the voice of a corpse. The narrator has just been murdered and thrown down a well. He tells us he is an artist—a miniaturist who paints and embellishes books. Although we learn his murderer is a fellow miniaturist, the identity of the culprit is not revealed until the last pages of the novel. Other speakers include the murderer, fellow miniaturists, their mentors, a matchmaker, lovers, a storyteller, the image of a horse, a dog, a tree, a coin, the color red, death, and Satan. Some of the speakers address the reader directly as if extending an invitation to participate in the debate.. As the narrative gradually unfolds, we listen in on debates about the merits and demerits of eastern vs. western art; the nature of art; the perspective adopted by the artist; whether certain images are idolatrous/anti-Islamic; the artist’s anonymity vs. personal style and self-aggrandizement; artistic styles that have been passed down through the centuries; and vibrant descriptions of beautifully illuminated manuscripts alongside the stories they tell. Weaving in and out of these threads is a love story, a murder mystery that keeps one in suspense, and lamentations for a dying art form. To add complexity to an already complex tapestry, many of the speakers express themselves and answer questions on philosophy, religion, or art by telling stories derived from the cultural fabric of their society.. This is a great novel with a broad sweep that sheds light on a particular period in history while addressing some of the same philosophical, religious, and aesthetic issues we struggle with today. It is a challenging read but well worth the effort.. Highly recommended.","Dec 23, 2017"
3640547,Victoria Evangelina Allen,"~WANDERING THE STREETS~. The beauty of the language enchanted me and I was lost in descriptions of Istanbul, the city I love dearly, the city which is today, in my eyes, is one of the capitals of Islamic Art. The stories of the murdered one, seeking justice; of two love birds, wishing to unite and the history of miniaturist art and apprenticeship of the 16-century Ottoman Empire (now Turkey) and other story lines, narrated by some 10 story-tellers, are masterfully woven in this elaborate, yet easily engaging masterpiece. No wonder that it greatly contributed to Pamuk's Nobel Price winning!. My Name is Red. references a number of books illustrated by famous miniaturists and it was quite a joy for I had seen some of them in museums in Central Asia and elsewhere; and the Khosru and Shireen's love story, which forms the central idea behind the love story in. My Name is Red. , is written by the greatest romantic epic poet in Persian literature: Nezami, who is greatly appreciated, widely-known and much loved in my home-country of Uzbekistan.. Special gratitude to the translator Erdag M. Goknar: the English translation of the book won the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award in 2003. But this beautiful writing is not a quick read: imagine looking at the finest work of miniaturist art with thousands of tiny brush-strokes, relying onto each other in such a way, that if even one of them was missing it would bring the whole great structure down onto its knees. The same with Orhan Pamuk's most talented writing; but once you let yourself free to wander the streets of imagination, vividness and passion of the Ottoman Empire's great city, you'll be smoothly guided to the very end of this suspense murder mystery full of ideas and meditations on the East-West..

181682,Miguel,"Exactly... if I can somewhat parrot what Eric said, I was surprised and disappointed by the reviews of this book on this site. I really have not read a historical fiction that was written in such a stylistically pleasing and creative way; from all kinds of perspectives (My name is death, I am a gold coin, etc etc). It also really reminded me of the Name of the Rose in that the quality of the epic struggle is so finely encapsulated in this book. Struggles over the quest for knowledge, what it means to have a style, coping with resentment and the meaning of faith, as well as the difficulties of the transition from the old paradigm to the new. I believe when you are endeavoring to write a historical fiction you really have to start a new school of thought, and I think great authors (i.e. Eco, Pamuk) just go with it, and interpret history in such a way that they try to create day to day events or a story that takes place within a minute time frame in the expanse of vague historic knowledge. I loved this book.","Sep 06, 2007"
39192152,Ed Yong,"Before selfies, there were portraits; before Facebook, there were diaries. This is a book about the innate egocentrism of humans perfectly reflected in the abundant use of metafiction. It is also rather critical about certain beliefs in Islam. Its depiction of homosexuality and gender invites judgement more than imposing one. The central discussion concerns realism and style in painting and immortality/mortality of painting/style which is also a vehicle for various exploration of humanity. It also talks about influences between artists which is begging for an application of Harold Bloom's theory (which investigates how writers influence and attempt to differentiate from each other).. The tree, the dog, the coin, the horse. Fascinating symbolism. This book is a treasure trove that is worth multiple revisitings. Another big success of this novel is how it justifies the titular inclusion of ""red"". Red is love, Red is death.","Oct 02, 2017"
40889078,Rado Baťo,"Brilliant and stylish take on tensions in a society caused by never ending battle between traditional and modern, the East and the West, local and global. It is set in Ottoman Istanbul of the 16th century, the capitol of the most powerful empire of its time westward of China. Drama is created by the invasion of ""Venetian style"" of painting into the traditional art of Muslim miniaturists who for centuries had been trying to depict reality from ""the perspective of Allah."". This set-up of the book might be medieval (and beautifully sketched) empire, but challenges described by Pamuk are as valid as ever. Maybe history is not repeating itself regularly, but our gut reactions to perceived external threats caused by foreign culture, religion, modernization and globalization are pretty much predictable.","Jan 24, 2017"

1628041,Book Concierge,"Book on CD performed by John Lee. Set in 16th-century Instanbul, this is a murder mystery, an art history lesson, and a love story all in one. The Sultan has commissioned a new book and directs Enishte Effendi to appoint a group of acclaimed miniaturists to illuminate the manuscript “in the style of the Franks.” But figurative art can be seen as an affront to Islam, so it’s a dangerous commission that must remain secret, and no one in the group knows the full scope of the project. When one of the artists disappears, the Sultan demands answers within three days. Was this the work of a devout follower of Islam, or is this a case of jealous rivalry for the hand of Enishte’s beautiful daughter Shekure?. I’ve had this on my tbr for a long time. I really enjoy reading international literature, and this one puts me smack dab into the world of historic Istanbul. But I found it difficult to follow because of Pamuk’s unusual style. Each chapter has a different narrator – including not only the major characters (Black, Shekure, Esther, Butterfly, etc), but a corpse, a tree, a dog, an ancient coin, and even death. Each chapter is written in first person giving the reader only that narrator’s perspective.. When he focuses on the murder and the investigation, the story is quite compelling. However, Pamuk also includes long passages on art, the history of Turkey, and the teachings of Islam. Some of these helped me to understand the culture and the references, but mostly they interrupted the story arc and sometimes had me scratching my head wondering what I had just missed.. The audio book is masterfully performed by John Lee, whose voice reminds me of Jeremy Irons. He really had his job cut out for him, given the style of writing and the many characters. There were times when I had to read the text to be sure I hadn’t missed something. Still, Lee was definitely up to the task. I would rate his narration at 5 stars. Bravo.","Mar 14, 2018"
36586786,Shaima Faisal,"Winter days in Istanbul, the Ottoman Empire in 1591, during the reign of Sultan Murat III.. The Sultan assigned the task of commissioning a book to Enishte Effendi, the father of beautiful Shekure and maternal uncle of Black. The book is supposed to depict the victories and powers of the Ottoman Empire and the Sultan himself, and will be released to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Prophet’s Hijra.. A mysterious murder coincide with the arrival of Black, after 12 year of exile. Now, Enishte Effedi who needs to complete the book before the deadline, assigned Black to replace the murdered miniaturist. In order to gain back Enishte’s and Shekure’s trust and love, Black accepted the challenge.. With the rise of the Erzurumi movement, a group of religious people that oppose illustration altogether considering it as a form of blasphemy, and the confusion and greed that Enishte’s team of miniaturist face because they are used to and was trained to illuminate using the Ottoman style but asked to adopt the Frankish style in illustrations within the book, another crime occurs.. A parallel line in the novel is the love story of Black and Shekure, a reflection of the tragic romance story of Hüsrev and Shirin, borrowed from the famous epic “Shahnameh Dear ” written by Ferdousi and elaborated by Nezami in his “Panj Ganj/Khamsa”. The tragic ending of Chief Miniaturist Master Osman emulating the blindness of the legendary miniaturist Bihzad represents the end of the Ottoman miniature because after that, the miniaturists follow the Frankish style.. The novel is heavy and dense with details and metaphors. I felt sorry for myself because I should have read the “Shahnameh” beforehand. Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading it. Pamuk reminded me of Eco in “The Name of The Rose”. Ok, this is my first experience with Pamuk, and surely will not be the last.","Jul 22, 2018"
3007716,Meg,"My Name is Red. my first stray into Turkish fiction so I'm not sure if the resonance the themes had with me had more to do with Orhan Pamuk's personal preoccupations or Turkey's wider preoccupations as a society and culture. Probably both, since by dint of geography and history, Turkey becomes the stage for competing influences from Europe and Asia. I wonder why I never realized before that Turkish literature might be the best place to find works expressing this existential angst of being caught between East and West, which is kind of the basis of my identity, if we're getting armchair psychologist here. I gotta to say to all these characters in. My Name is Red. being torn apart having to deal with the friction between eastern and western traditions and struggling to re-negotiate their identity: I get it. I feel y'all. It was so nice to see this played out in literature!. The murderer in. My Name is Red. --a miniaturist painter who kills two other artists over a book threatening to introduce the western philosophy of painting to Turkish painting -- is especially fascinating. He's of course driven by feelings of superiority and rage, which are emotional motives. But his intellectual reasons are fascinating: both wanting to cling to tradition and wanting to discard it, wanting to be part of a society that values the collective ( which he grew up in) while secretly wanting to be part of society that places the individual above all else. Who doesn't want to believe they are unique and special? Such is the siren song of individualism. A tempting enough creed to anyone with an ego; but even more tempting to a gifted artist wanting to be lauded as a master, but slavishly bound to a workshop's and culture's orthodoxy.. Denial of style, of his identity, leads him to murder-- I can't help but thinking of that amazing scene where he tries but fails to draw an accurate self-portrait of himself, in the style of the Venetians. Now, I don't know if anyone actually has been incited to murder (I hope not) over miniaturist painting, or because they can't resolve the tensions between individualism and collectivism and east and west. (Most certainly they have due to the sparring between traditional and modern concepts). Of course, in real life a murderer driven by these motives would be ghastly indeed, but put it into a novel, intellectualize and make it literary, by having a character be so tormented by these discordant philosophies: it's really brilliant. The other intellectual murderer I thought of while reading this novel is Dostoyevsky's Rodion Raskolnikov from. Crime and Punishment. ; one of literature's greatest character studies. What I'm trying to say is I've realized I dig intellectual murderers at the center of a plot in novels, as a way to explore societal pressures, and as a character's futile attempt to remake or understand oneself. I wonder if these tormented literary murderers tend to be male characters, however. The murderesses I've read in literature tend to kill as an act of protest or desperation after a lifetime of degradation. So, if anyone knows of an intellectual woman murderer in literature--someone who commits murder because they are trying to understand their identity or test their personal philosophy-- do recommend!. Another thing I wanted to note about. My Name is Red. : I think it's helped me view painting in a different way. I happened to be visiting a lot of art museums during spring break while reading this book, and I found myself looking at paintings in a different way because of it. Crossing from adjacent rooms dedicated to the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th century European painting, I finally understood on a deeper level how revolutionary the theory of perspective was at that time. What more can you ask of literature? If it can change or enrich the way you observe or interpret things in the smallest way, or make you re-evaluate or better understand a concept, it has been successful. Also, I don't think I've ever seen Turkish miniature paintings in person, but now I'm super curious. According to Pamuk, Muslim artists were attempting to paint the world as God perceived it, not as humans did, and artistic perfection was the flawless imitation of old masters. It's a philosophy of art that I hadn't thought of before, but no less valid than the western tradition I'm familiar with.. This is a novel of ideas. With the exception of a few instances, Pamuk presents his themes in an adept way--not too overbearing. There's definitely a lot of things he raises in the novel that I want to chew over still. To paraphrase: is style merely imperfection, not individualism? Are all pictures only possible through memory, even if what you're drawing is in front of you? Does a painting achieve legendary status for its nature or what is said about it? Is beauty really just the eye discovering what the mind knows already?. Right now I'm rating this book four stars, partly because I struggled to stay engaged at a few points in the novel--in particular, I'm thinking of when Pamuk took us away from the plot and made us read nine parables in a row (""Alif,"" ""Ba"" and ""Djim"") and then told us how we should interpret these parables-- quite tiresome. Still, I suspect this book might come to have a special staying power for me, so don't be surprised if I eventually upgrade it to 5 stars.. Some quotes I liked:. ""I don't want to be a tree, I want to be its meaning."". ""Painting is the silence of thought and the music of sight."". ""A great painter does not content himself by affecting us with his masterpieces; ultimately, he succeeds in changing the landscape of our minds. Once a miniaturist's artistry enters our souls this way, it becomes the criterion for the beauty of our world."". ""But as with all lovers of color, he gets carried away with his emotions and is fickle."". ""It was Satan who first said 'I!' It was Satan who adopted a style. It was Satan who separated East from West."". ""I now understand that by furtively and gradually re-creating the same pictures for hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of artists had cunningly depicted the gradual transformation of their world into another."". ""Books, which we mistake for consolation, only add depth to our sorrow.""","Apr 23, 2017"
44046886,Nafees Ahmed,"Orhan Pamuk does a rare thing with 'My Name is Red' - he patiently weaves artistic philosophy to voice the cultural difference with a murder mystery to keep passive audience engage. Venetian painting - conferring the immortality to the humans through deftly painted self-portrait causes the ruckus among the miniaturists of Istanbul who believe in imitating the work of their masters without the scope of subjective interference. Eastern art is governed by the perspective of Allah and Western art is governed by the of humans. Eastern style doesn't give scope for artistic exploration. Any form of individualistic style or originality is considered as blasphemy. A secret project is commissioned by the Ottoman Sultan that borders in imitating the Western style and thus results in the mysterious death of one of the miniaturists. It's a breezy read but beware, the subtexts are complex and allegorical nested stories, recurring in Pamuk's novel, make the story layered and intellectually gratifying.","Feb 26, 2019"

Sometimes I used to feel overwhelmed by how dense the story was yet I was not considering putting it down. I decided to let myself enjoy this volume on my own pace. I was always picking it up with curiosity, interest and ready for a mind pleasure. Huge advantage of ""My Name Is Red"" is in my opinion the way it is structured. It is written considering different characters points of views. I was astonished how Pamuk could write a text from the perspective of a tree, gold coin, satan or death with the same artistry. It seems mind-blowing. The plot itself is not very complex. It is a story about love-obsession, art, skilled miniaturists who devotes their lives to illustrating books from the earliest years under the strong, demanding but also very affective eye of their master. It is also about death, life, ways of seeing, rebellion and revenge. It is about what could we give up for the things we believe in or love. The highest point of this book is definitely the way it was written. Masterpiece. I cannot wait to explore other creations by Orhan Pamuk.","Apr 14, 2019"

To be sure, the writing style was enjoyable and the discussions were elegant, but given the complexity of Pamuk's project, it's awfully hard to integrate as a whole.

263205,Matthew,"Someone or other once said that ""self-confidence is knowing what you can't do well, and avoiding it."" While that perspective sounds like a recipe for a fairly limited life, there's an element of truth to it -- particularly when it comes to writing.. There's a kind of writerly skill that almost never gets mentioned in book reviews, because it precedes anything that appears on the page. It's the process of choosing a plot and structure for the as-yet-nonexistent novel: part inspiration and part calculation, a kind of half-conscious gestation during which the writer chooses a quarry that matches their particular strengths and weaknesses. We can call this the. cunning. of the author, which consists of (to revisit the maxim above) knowing what you can't do well, and avoiding it -- or better yet, turning that shortcoming to your advantage.. My Name Is Red. is possibly the best example of ""writerly cunning"" I've ever encountered. Ostensibly, the plot is a kind of stylized murder-mystery: at the Ottoman court in Constantinople, a miniaturist (manuscript illuminator) is killed while working on an innovative, possibly blasphemous book, and everyone scrambles to find out whodunnit. Within this ""frame story"" however,. My Name Is Red. is something much more: narrated by something like seven primary characters (with voices from a few secondary characters, and even inanimate objects, chiming in), it's a debate about individuality vs. tradition, and the nature of selfhood.. According to Ottoman tradition, a miniaturist should not have a recognizable painting style, and should not even sign their own work: they should function as anonymous clerks, revealing God's creation. Contact between this tradition and Venetian (western European) painting, in which individual style was highly valued, inevitably led to upheaval within the Ottoman artistic world. Each of the characters in this novel is torn between the ""old way"" of doing things, in which the significance of individuals (both in art and in life) is minimized, and the tempting (but perhaps blasphemous) idea that individual style has value and should not be hidden. In a reductionist sort of way, we might call this a tug-of-war between group- and individual-based notions of identity.. All of this is interesting enough, but Pamuk's stroke of genius is this: he simply cannot (it seems) convincingly write from multiple distinct points of view.. Brilliant.. By writing a novel told by multiple characters, each of whom longs to have an individual style --. but all of whom sound exactly the same. -- Pamuk illustrates dramatically the pathos of these characters, and the cognitive distance between the worlds they hope to bridge. This is a feat of writerly cunning and ingenuity that left me, quite simply, in awe.. On the other hand, as a reader, much of. My Name Is Red. left me cold. The sameness of all the voices in the novel does begin to grow tedious after awhile, and the stories-within-a-story told by various characters felt like contrived digressions. This is more a writer's book than a reader's -- but as a work of authorial architecture, it is a masterpiece.","Jan 07, 2009"
4037122,Tarfah,"Let me preface this by saying that from the get-go I felt that this book was just not my style; the author's style was just too convoluted, and the prose too high-brow. Having said that, I took this book as a personal challenge which I just could not put away unfinished.. The intrigue surrounding the book commissioned by the Sultan around which the entire story was based, and the murders that occurred due to the book's supposedly blasphemous content, were, in my opinion, really just an excuse to go on and on about the history of Arab, Persian (generally Eastern) artistry (calligraphers, illustrators, illuminators, etc.). Lovers of art and history would most likely be enraptured by My Name is Red.. Also, the never-ending repetition of the Shirin and Husrev love story was truly irritating. When I first started this book, I had never heard of them. By the end of it, I didn't want to hear any more! Same goes with the tale of the Whitesheep and the Blacksheep. I kept on thinking ""not this again!"". I also did not like the heroine Shekure in the slightest: hated her manipulative and conniving nature, and thought she was a terrible role-model for her sons, who, as the whim struck her, and as they suited her convenience, she could be cuddling one minute, then cruelly slapping the next.. The highlight of the story for me was the chapter ""I am a gold coin"". For someone who doesn't enjoy overly descriptive novels, I thought the imagery and the reader's imagination were truly captured in telling the story of the coin- truly wonderful.. My favorite character was that of the Jewess, Esther, whose colorfulness and busy-body meddling were truly entertaining, and whose character was the most relatable.. In short, I truly felt this book could have been ALOT shorter than it was- basically the entire story surrounding the Sultan's book and the associated murders could have been told in under 200 pages were it not for the over descriptive nature of the author's writing style and his continuous re-telling of the same/similar tidbits of artistic history.. I can understand why readers would enjoy this book, but it definitely isn't my style.","Jul 21, 2010"
4356644,Hira,"It is seldom that one picks up a book that bypasses any and all genres, and comes alive in your hands and speaks to you. Such is the kind of book Orhan Pamuk has written. Part love story, part murder plot, part commentary on all things spiritual - it is a beautifully written book with a great many multi-faceted characters.. Pamuk uses various different characters to narrate his book - some of the chapters even narrated by unusual characters such as the murdered corpse of Elegant Effendi, ""Ink"", a ""Coin"", Satan, two dervishes and the color ""Red"". It is especially the voices of these characters that become emblazoned upon your soul.. The plot lies in the murder of Elegant Effendi, the reason for which is stated to be his working on an illustrated book commissioned by the Sultan. 'Black', who is in love with late Elegant's daughter Shekure, is striving hard to uncover the murderer and win widowed Shekure's hand in marriage. Also, we hear from his fellow artists/miniaturists ""Butterfly"", ""Stork"" and ""Olive"", with their views on the West influencing Eastern arts. Thus, Orhan Pamuk is able to masterfully entwine a mystery, a romance, and allegory to the clash of Eastern and Western culture all in one wonderful book.. In his book, Pamuk writes ""An artist should never succumb to hubris of any kind, he should simply paint the way he sees fit rather than troubling over East or West."" - and that is precisely how Pamuk offers his progressive perspective, richly Eastern in nature, but pleasantly influenced by Western ideologies as well. He creates an amalgamation of both cultures, in which the values of each one are preserved and respected, and does it quite successfully. Olive, one of the miniaturists, offers his perspective on art as, ""Through our colors, paints, art and love, we remember that Allah had commanded us to ""See""!"" - and that is what Orhan Pamuk so craftily presents in this book, a chance for the reader to see beyond cultures and races, similarities and differences and be completely enchanted by the mystical, lyrical and awe-inspiring realm that ""My Name is Red"" is, as a novel.","Sep 29, 2010"
5603048,Jeruen,"This is a complicated read. It took me a month to read this, which was somewhat unexpected. So, what is this book about?. My Name is Red is a story about a murder, set in 1600 in Istanbul. An illustrator is found murdered, and the book weaves a story where the reader is kept guessing as to the identity of the murderer. Along with it is woven a story of love and sex, and family relations in the Islamic world.. The book is written in a post-modern style, and after reading this, I understand why the author garnered a Nobel Prize for this book. Every chapter has a different narrator, so the story is told through various points of view. Even atypical narrators are utilized in this story, including a gold coin, a corpse, a picture of a horse, and so on. With that I am impressed with the creativity of the author.. However, it took me a long time before I grew to like this book. Several factors came into play, for this to be the case. First of all, I am not at all familiar with the cultural references that the book has with respect to Istanbul and the Islamic World in the Middle Ages. The fact that there are several narrators also made things complicated, since I had a little bit of difficulty keeping track of who was who in the stream of events. It was after I finished half of the book that I started liking this novel, when the possible murderers were narrowed down to three.. No matter how I do not like the story, however, praise should be given to the structure. This is not just a simple airport novel. This is literature. I had to make full use of my brain when I was reading this. This was no simple read, and it required me to analyze and exercise some critical thinking in order to understand this novel.. All in all, I believe this is a very mature novel. People who only want some swooning mystery or romance will not find this enjoyable. Only people who want something that stimulates the brain will find this a great read. If you're one of those people, then by all means pick this book up.","Jun 09, 2011"
56111743,Roman Clodia,"Firstly, despite the way Faber have decided to promote this book, it's not a murder mystery in the way those words are usually understood: so if you're looking for a thriller with clues, twists and turns, this definitely isn't it. Partly for that reason I think the reviews which compare it with Eco's The Name of the Rose are off-point. That was a book which playfully refers to the intertextual nature of all reading; reading isn't what's at stake in Pamuk's book at all.. Instead it is a profound and engaging meditation on the contrasting and sometimes conflicting views of eastern and western aesthetics of art, especially visual and religious art: or, rather, the religiosity of art.. Yes, there is a murder which kicks off the story, and another one mid-way through (very brutal and disturbing) but who did it really isn't either the point or the driver of this book. There's also a love story at its heart, but one which draws on the Persian epics that it constantly refers to and so half invites and half resists comparisons with western love stories.. Other reviewers on Amazon have complained about the narrative voices all sounding the same, and that is the case, but I assume because Pamuk isn't interested in writing a character-driver novel. Also don't read it if you're expecting a lush historical full of exotic detail as that's not the type of book it is.. In summary, this is an intellectually-accomplished and brave novel that deals with hard subjects. It's not a difficult read but it is a slow one, one that you need to take your time over and digest, not a page-turner where you can't wait to find out what happens next. I think it's an important book but it won't be to everyone's taste.","Jun 09, 2016"
4056626,Shreerag Plakazhi,"What is the meaning of art? Is it meant as entertainment, is it meant to please the masses or answer a higher calling? These are some of the questions that will be brought to you as you read this book. Answers, as any good philosopher knows is not important, but the questions are there for you to interpret as you choose. The questions are inevitable if you spend a lifetime reading books of this nature.. Reading My Name is Red was for me quite labourious. The prose style is something I haven't encountered before and I had to force myself to keep reading for at least the first 20% of the book. Once I got used to the varied points of view and the inherent unreliability of narrators, I started seeing the writing from a higher perspective. I was now the observer to this carefully carved universe of illuminators and calligraphers in Ottoman times. Pamuk does a great job of simulating what I like to call the Rashomon narrative - allowing us to be judges to multiple perspectives of a flowing story. The result is Nobel worthy.. The simplest explanation of plot for My Name is Red is that it is a murder mystery. The most complicated explanation for it is that it is so much more than just a simple murder mystery. Like many such books, the plot really is not very relevant to any discussion. It's just a means of exploring a world that feels like it has been created just for us. A world that exists just for us to make sense of the time period it was written about.. My Name is Red is an astounding piece of work. My biggest takeaway from the book is a renewed sense of belief in art and its importance in our lives. What greater gift can come from Turkey?","May 13, 2017"
335159,Ruth,"I'm not sure how to rate this book. On the one hand, Pamuk is an important writer and I should take advantage of what I can enjoy/learn from him. On the other hand, all the time I was reading I had to convince myself of this in order to keep marching on.. On the one hand, as an artist, I found the bits of information about the miniature arts and artists fascinating. On the other, would that they remained bits, instead of veering off toward treatises that interrupted the flow of the story.. On the one hand, it could have been a gripping murder mystery. On the other hand, it wasn’t. Part of the fun of a mystery is being able to guess at some of the possible solutions as you read. I was way, way, way too confused to guess.. On the one hand, it could have been an absorbing love story. On the other hand, it didn’t seem that either of the protagonists really gave a damn.. On the one hand, the multiple viewpoints thing worked brilliantly. On the other, it completely confused me in the beginning, and later I began to find it a tiresome gimmick that interrupted the flow with endless digressions.. On the one hand, I would have probably gotten more out of the book if I hadn’t skimmed in quite a few sections. On the other hand, I did skim or I’d still be bogged down in graceful if seemingly unending verbiage.. On the one hand, if I were rating on how important the book is I'd give it 4 stars. On the other, GR defines these stars as to how well one liked the book. Using that reasoning, I'll have to give it two.","Jun 04, 2008"
29209,Desiree Koh,"MP bet me $20 that I wouldn't like this book. The Brats were enthralled by this, because they can't remember the last time I whole-heartedly liked a book we read.. I liked and enjoyed the book, right until about page 350 (of 500) when I absolutely did not want to read any more about the philosophy of 16th century Islamic art nor flowery speeches about famous Turkish miniatures. Pamuk does himself a lot of injustice by making the book twice as long as it needs to be. I stopped caring and analyzing, which is a pity, because it's a very smart book that skilfully employs literary devices so proficiently it could teach a creative writing course. You could follow the carefully embedded clues to uncover the culprit of the murder that's central to the plot by detecting nuances in each character's narrative and his painting style. It's interesting to note that by the end of the book, Pamuk has placed himself as the true narrator, while challenging you to whole-heartedly believe what he has said. You realize that you've just examined a piece of literature a la CSI the way curators may a work of art.. If that work of art was a mosaic the size of the Great Wall of China. I’m giving MP $10.","Mar 28, 2008"
271946,Jaspreet,"I picked up My Name is Red by Orhan Pamuk to fulfill the November destination of the World Party Reading Challenge. It took me much longer than expected to finish the book. While the story was interesting, it is a murder mystery with many possible suspects, I found it hard to get through in the beginning. I was confused by the cast of characters, but I grew to enjoy the subplots as well as the main plot. Looking at paintings and artistic style to determine a murderer was very intriguing. I learned a lot about the connection between art and Islam.. The format of the book also drew me in as each chapter is told from a different perspective, including objects like coins and colors like red. The book one many awards and while I appreciated the story, I felt like I was not fully grasping all of the historical information. In spite of my slight feelings of inadequacy, I did appreciate the longing of the miniaturists to protect a practice which they had spent their whole lives perfecting.. For me, the character of Shekure best represented the tension between the modern and traditional world. She navigates societal norms and expectations in order to secure a place for herself and her children. It is impressive that she manages to create a life with one of the men she loves.","Apr 01, 2011"
15236138,Reem Ghabbany,Where should I start with this amazing book! I bought this book while I was on vacation in Istanbul last March.. This is literally a master piece! An absolutely well written book.. I don't think I've read a book this complicated and this detailed.. I never guessed who the killer was until the very end when it was super obvious.. Okay let me tell you a bit about this book.. It a story from 400 years ago. Based in Istanbul. About a group of miniaturists who devoted their lives to painting. They breathed art and because of their obsession with art it drove them to commit foul murderers.. There's also a beautiful love a story and talks about Islam.. I gave this book 5 starts because it definitely deserves 5 stars! If there were 10 starts I'd give it to that book cause I never read a book like this before so well depicted and beautifully written.. Although this was a hard read for me cause it's different from what I usually read and to be honest I think only someone who's very smart would enjoy this book which is why I didn't enjoy so much cause I didn't understand a lot of the things in it lol.,"Mar 17, 2016"

I did like it, despite the length, despite all those details referring to names of shahs, miniaturists and all kind of Persian and Turkish art references I wasn't familiar with. Speaking of that, the (excellent) Romanian edition has a very useful glossary at the end of the book, plus the footnotes (did I ever mention I'm a sucker for footnotes?).. The story is quite captivating and it has a little bit of everything - romance, murder, mystery, good VS evil, old/traditional VS new and a huge amount of info about Ottoman culture, art and lifestyle. And, another interesting thing, each chapter is told from a different perspective, whether it's one of the characters or a detail from the miniatures (a tree, a dog or a colour)..

35112891,Naddy,"Plot : At once a fiendishly devious mystery, a beguiling love story, and a brilliant symposium on the power of art, My Name Is Red is a transporting tale set amid the splendor and religious intrigue of sixteenth-century Istanbul, from one of the most prominent contemporary Turkish writers.. The Sultan has commissioned a cadre of the most acclaimed artists in the land to create a great book celebrating the glories of his realm. Their task: to illuminate the work in the European style. But because figurative art can be deemed an affront to Islam, this commission is a dangerous proposition indeed. The ruling elite therefore mustn’t know the full scope or nature of the project, and panic erupts when one of the chosen miniaturists disappears. The only clue to the mystery–or crime? –lies in the half-finished illuminations themselves. Part fantasy and part philosophical puzzle, My Name is Red is a kaleidoscopic journey to the intersection of art, religion, love, sex and power.. I think Historical fiction is new genre which i am devouring off-late, My Name is Red is part thriller, part romance and part philosophical. It opens with Ottoman Sultan commissioning the making of illustrated book rendered in Venetian style to be presented as a gift to Dodge. A miniaturist called Elegant is so appalled by the blasphemy of this realistic depiction that another miniaturist kills him out of fear that he will incite the wrath of the ones who follows the stricter version of Islam against all miniaturists.. To sumarise, My Name is Red is a philosophical thriller constructed around the clash between these two views of artistic meaning, which is also a chasm between two world civilisations.. The writing is something very unique, each page starts with I am then character name, I really liked the way it has been written. Orhan is my new favourite. To me this profound book with deep roots.. “I hear the question upon your lips: What is it to be a colour?. Colour is the touch of the eye, music to the deaf, a word out of the darkness. Because I’ve listened to souls whispering – like the susurrus of the wind – from book to book and object to object for tens or thousands of years, allow me to say that my touch resembles the touch of angels. Part of me, the serious half, calls out to your vision while the mirthful half sours through the air with your glances.. I’m so fortunate to be red! I’m fiery. I’m strong. I know men take notice of me and that I cannot be resisted.. I do not conceal myself: For me, delicacy manifests itself neither in weakness nor in subtlety, but through determination and will. So, I draw attention to myself. I’m not afraid of other colours, shadows, crowds or even of loneliness. How wonderful it is to cover a surface that awaits me with my own victorious being! Wherever I’m spread, I see eyes shine, passions increase, eyebrows rise and heartbeats quicken. Behold how wonderful it is to live! Behold how wonderful to see. I am everywhere. Life begins with and returns to me. Have faith in what I tell you.”","Jul 20, 2020"
2634423,TheGirlBytheSeaofCortez,"Orhan Pamuk’s exquisite novel,. My Name is Red. , is set in Istanbul in the late 16th century, during the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. Sultan Murat III, however, stubbornly refuses to face reality and persists in believing the Empire is at its zenith, instead. Wanting to celebrate a thousand years of Islam, he listens attentively to one of his miniaturists who has just returned from a trip to Venice, both impressed and obsessed with the ""new"" style of painting he observed there.. The Sultan is a man concerned with making an impression, and he commissions a book, a very special and secret book, that, when complete, will be sent to the Doge, in Venice. Breaking with tradition, the Sultan orders Enishte Effendi to gather together four celebrated miniaturists to decorate a book in the Frankish, or Venetian, style of painting, complete with perspective and portraiture, something not found in Eastern painting.. Miniaturists depicted scenes of battle, scenes of everyday life, scenes of love and more, in a rigidly prescribed manner. The leaf of a tree, or a blade of grass, was given as much importance as was the face of a person. And when persons were depicted, they were never representational; a man could be any man, a woman, any woman. Perspective remained always the same, and the miniaturists painted as if they were viewing the scene from the vantage point of Allah.. The Frankish style of painting, because it glorifies the individual, goes against strict Islamic dogma and is considered an insult to Allah, himself. Thus, the miniaturists selected to work on the new book must work in the strictest of secrecy, and not all of them agree that the Frankish style of painting is the path an artist should pursue. It isn’t long before one of the miniaturists, Elegant Effendi, a master gilder, is found dead. Indeed, he is already dead when the book opens, but Pamuk, who is an innovative author, allows Elegant to speak to us from the grave.. There are three miniaturists left working on the book, and one of them, Enishte believes, has to be Elegant’s murderer.. In an effort to solve Elegant’s murder, Enishte recalls his nephew, Black, a civil servant who has spent the last twelve years working in ""the provinces,"" to Istanbul. Black’s mission is really twofold: he wants to solve Elegant’s murder, and on a more personal level, he wants to win the heart of Shekure, Enishte’s beautiful daughter, something he failed to do twelve years previously. But, before he can solve Elegant’s murder, yet another murder occurs, this one hitting far closer to home.. So, is. My Name is Red. a murder mystery or is it a love story? Well, it’s a little of both, and yet, it’s also neither. I do think the voices of Shekure and Black are the book’s most compelling and the characters with whom the reader feels the most empathy. As a Moslem woman, Shekure is confined to her home with only her sons, Orhan and Shevket, for company. Her efforts at letting Black know she’s open to his advances are expedited by Esther, a Jewish seller of fabric and an inveterate matchmaker. Esther is, I think, one of the most colorful characters in the book and she certainly adds a bit of comic relief.. My Name is Red. is told in fifty-nine short chapters and from the viewpoint of about a dozen of the book’s characters, including Black, Shekure, a sketch of a horse, a counterfeit gold coin, a tree, the corpse of the murdered Elegant, a dog, the color red, Satan and the three remaining miniaturists: Olive, Stork and Butterfly. Although one might think that a book containing so many point of view characters would be ""choppy,"" this isn’t the case with. My Name is Red. . It. is. difficult to get involved with the characters, however. We know their thoughts, true, but many of them are unreliable narrators, and as the persistent reader will discover at the book’s end, Pamuk has been playing a little literary game with us. All is definitely not what it seems.. Although. My Name is Red. is not, in any way, choppy, Pamuk really doesn’t give his characters, other than possibly Black, Shekure and Master Osman, distinct voices. The three remaining miniaturists all sound exactly the same. With the exception of one concluding chapter, the reader could switch their names around at will and it wouldn’t make the slightest difference. This makes it very difficult to care who killed Elegant and why. Truthfully, I didn’t care who it was. I didn’t want it to be Butterfly, simply because I liked his name the best, and that’s really not a very good reason.. My Name is Red. is a very densely plotted, convoluted book, chock full of detail. Many people have compared it to Umberto Eco glorious. The Name of the Rose. , and it’s quite obvious that Pamuk used the latter book as his inspiration. Both books contain seemingly unsolvable murders, both involve interaction between intellectuals and the community to which they belong, both involve social commentary and both are, as I mentioned above, very densely plotted.. The Name of the Rose. , is, I think, more atmospheric and, in addition, it’s a roman-a-clef, something. My Name is Red. is not.. My Name is Red. is, of course, neither plot nor character driven, but thematically based. It’s a meditation on East-meets-West (which makes it highly fitting that it’s set in Istanbul, since that’s the only city in the world that geographically, straddles two continents...Europe and Asia), art, and the age-long tendency of Islam to simply self-destruct. To Pamuk’s credit, he never slips into polemic. He tells his story and lets his readers draw their own conclusions.. While some sections, in particular, the sections narrated by the three murder suspects, can be quite dry, for the most part. My Name is Red. is beautifully written. The book contains some beautiful and unforgettable set pieces. The set piece in which Master Osman blinds himself rather than paint in the Western style is unforgettable, and the set piece detailing the book’s second murder, during which red ink and crimson blood mingle and become one, is exquisitely written and really, not at all gruesome.. Although Pamuk never gives us a clue as to which type of art he, himself prefers, Black, his creation, does say this:. Everybody secretly desires to have a style. Everybody also deserves to have his portrait made, just as Our Sultan did. Is this affliction impossible to resist? As this plague spreads, none of us will be able to stand against the methods of the Europeans. .. That, I think, remains to be seen.","Aug 19, 2009"
58543750,Aditi Chikhale,"Amidst the lockdown during coronavirus, I had run out of physical books to read. My sister’s friend came to the rescue and brought over a few from her collection. That is how I came to read. My Name is Red. , a book I didn’t know anything about. The blurb seemed very interesting and I started with this book set in 16th century Istanbul.. Elegant Effendi is murdered. The book opens with his corpse informing us about how he was murdered brutally over a dispute regarding a secret book. A secret book commissioned by the Sultan and managed by Enishte Effendi. He is responsible for the illustrations in the book and he has hired three miniaturists for this highly secretive and important job. Elegant Effendi is the gilder, a person who makes the borders of a page with gold, for this book. When he is murdered, the completion of this special book is in turmoil and it becomes essential to catch the killer.. Sounds interesting right? Well, it is but it was not really my cup of tea. You have to have a lot of patience to get through this book. The book is narrated from different perspectives and the reader is often included in the narrative, breaking the fourth wall. It is amusing. The plot is great, at its centre a clash of philosophies, and many short fables defending one point of view or another. The book speaks a lot about style and individuality and the way it is narrated emphasizes these points. It’s like looking at a kaleidoscope through a kaleidoscope, a meta-reading experience. There is no doubt that Orhan Pamuk is gifted to have written such a book. I can see that it is a work of genius but I didn’t like it much. The book stayed by my bedside for four weeks, wishing I could finish it quickly but not being able to read more than a few pages at a time.","Jun 10, 2020"
69332753,Jared Gibson,"An intellectually stimulating and entertaining murder mystery, My Name is Red presented me with something I have never encountered before: the philosophy behind medieval art. Not only is it a murder mystery and a love story, but it discusses the motivation behind the two styles of painting at the time: the European style and the Ottoman style. Set in Istanbul, most of the characters adhere to the Ottoman style and its philosophy lest they be labeled infidels for painting like the Europeans do. However, this does not prevent them from discussing why the Frankish style (or even both styles) are blasphemous. The result is a philosophical conversation that delves into nearly every aspect of painting, including “style.”. If you are not one for a debate on medieval art, you can still appreciate the components of the book that are more to entertaining. The narrator changes from chapter to chapter, and the reader sees the world as if in the mind of one of the characters of the novel. Although some may find this chaotic, Pamuk does a great job at jumping from narrator to narrator while preserving the coherence of the story. In this way, it is almost like relay race. Each character carries the baton as far as they can and when they can run no further, they hand it off to the next character. Although you may prefer not to think about it, this provides another layer to the philosophical discussion about “perspective.”","Jun 05, 2019"

181878,Natalie,"Complicated review.. I loved a lot of this book. The opening chapter was amazing. I loved the combination of love story and murder mystery and art history. I loved the rotating narrators, which could be a cute, cheap trick with some authors, but which Pamuk pulls off in the best way possible. I loved how the different narrators addressed the reader directly, and how that lent an element of distrust to the whole thing. My favorite narrators were Shekure, Esther, and the murderer. Shekure's character was fascinating--I loved watching her wring power out of her miserable, limited circumstances, her ingenuity in tenaciously pursuing her family's interests while awash in the sea of misogyny and violence. I loved how aware Esther was of all of Shekure's ploys (like when she sits crying in Hasan's house so that she doesn't have to make a decision about where to go, while making sure all the pieces are in place so that the outcome she wants will come about without her being held accountable for it). That was probably my favorite part of this book--seeing how two women worked together creatively to have as much autonomy and power in this society as possible.. And I loved what I thought. at first. was a tongue-in-cheek mockery of pretentious, highfalutin artists and philosophers. All the artist characters make absurd comparisons between things like drawing a horse and murdering a person. They go on ridiculous, loquacious tangents about art, and different art patterns, and how manuscript illumination was the real motivation behind all major historical events, and how it revealed so much about life, yadda yadda yadda. And they are arrogant, greedy, self-important, and patently ridiculous. I actively enjoyed every page; I couldn't get enough of Pamuk's words and characters.. But somewhere in the last third of the book, I felt like that mocking tone disappeared. (Or maybe I just misread the earlier parts?) It was no longer about laughing at the characters bloated sense of their own significance, and enjoying seeing how silly their narcissism and art-obsession made them. Without that tone, the pages and pages and pages about art styles and history and what-not became a bit of a drag. It started to read like an old Russian novel, with too much extended dinner-table philosophy. (Don't get me wrong, I love old Russian novels, but that style just wasn't working in this context.) After so much of the first half of the novel was written with really engaging dialogue and very down-to-earth narration, the more sedated narration towards the end just blew the momentum to pieces. The self-aware feeling of the narrative was the best part of the book to begin with, and I definitely enjoyed it less when it diminished.. I am in general not very into super philosophical approaches to art, and wordy treatises about how art reveals the depth of the human soul blah blah blah. That's why I enjoyed the portrayal of the artists as people who had all this narcissistic pretension about the importance of their work, while also just being self-serving assholes. (It was interesting, however, to juxtapose them against Master Osman, whose perspectives on art seemed a lot more important and real and meaningful.) So when the loooong paragraphs about art ceased to feel mocking, they mostly just became boring.. Also, Pamuk could have taken out fully 50% of the references to ""pretty young boys"" and still have gotten the point across perfectly. It came up so frequently that if just felt like he was trying to hit you over the head with it. I get it. Miniaturist society included a helluva lot of child molestation. It doesn't have to be mentioned every 5 pages.. Reading this made me remember that in the other Pamuk book I've read,. Snow. , color seemed to be important but unexplained--a notable character was named Blue, for example. It makes me want to research the symbolism of different colors in Turkish culture, because I feel like there might be another layer of meaning there that I'm missing.. Overall, 4 stars, because I reeeeally enjoyed a lot of this, and the bulk of it was just pure brilliance. I was bummed that parts of it ended up disappointing me.","Dec 10, 2013"
16737952,Jelena,"Although there is the challenge to unmask a murderer, „My Name is Red” is about as much a murder story as “The Brothers Karamazov”. It is also no mere love story and not just a historical novel. Not a theological dispute. More than an essay on art and even more than a question of identity, of the universal and individual. It is all of the above.. Naming the plot of this novel is very difficult, since ‒ apart from the protagonist trying to solve a murder case, to get the illustrations for a secret book finished and to win over the love of his life ‒ there are the personal stories of all the supporting characters and their connections and relationships, as well as contributions to several theoretical problems.. I was very intrigued by the sense that this is not a novel of action with a layer of contemplation underneath, but that the reader is much more focused on the discussion than on the actual ongoing in the fictional world. Or to speak just for myself: I cared much more for the metaphysics than about who did it and whether the hero gets the girl (somewhat like in “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” and again the “Karamazovs”).. Perspective and style are the origin of everything contained in this account. Taking place in the Ottoman Empire of the late 16th century and featuring a guild of master illustrators and everyone in connection with them, the basic question raised is whether to stick to the old, traditional ways by all means or to be open to something different allowing it maybe to change what one is accustomed to. But there is no need to have any kind of background in art history (or religion, for it gets close) for this one. It suffices to follow the question of what makes us what we are and if it is natural to wish for some unique feature that would distinguish an individual from the group or if modesty is the one virtue most difficultly achieved. There is also the question of whether what one sees is always what there is. If a thing changes with perspective, can a momentary view in all of its accuracy be of greater value than the steady and universal idea of the same thing? And even though it is never explicitly political, there is the lingering question of Go East vs. Go West, quite modern given the circumstances, but also a very good historical setting.. The structure of this novel alone is so fascinating that it contributes very much to the overall impression. There are about a dozen narrators, all characters in the novel, but of different age, gender, origin, social status etc, and about equally many that are neither alive nor human nor do they exist for that matter. We never hear the same story twice, for every narrator continues where the previous one had stopped or shows us scenes where the other characters are not present. The whole picture is put together piece by piece, like a puzzle. It is so perfectly orchestrated that you can feel someone pulling the strings and presenting a show. And there are always those fantasy narrators showing you how they know that you know about the conductor in the shadow, speaking directly to the reader (I have a thing for methods like that) etc.. And in case you do care about playing detective, look for some personal features that will reveal the murderer soon enough. This is a matter of style after all.","Mar 14, 2013"
12433059,Samuel,"I really wanted to like this book as much as other reviewers. It was not easy getting into Pamuk’s tale because of how much it reminded me, on the surface at least, of Eco’s. The Name of the Rose. (the title perhaps subtly recalls this debt, but most professional reviewers prefer to ignore the obvious and point out Pamuk’s indebtedness to Borges).. My Name is Red. weaves the clash of eastern and western culture, between Islam and modernity, into a tapestry of 16th century Istanbul when it was a superpower. The Turkish school of illuminators struggles with the influence of renaissance European portraiture then aflourish with individualism and perspective. Part of the irony of this depiction of the “anxiety of influence” is the degree to which the Turkish miniature school itself was influenced by Persian miniaturists, who in turn were influenced by Mongolian and Chinese artists, and going back even further, by Byzantine Christian miniaturists. The title presumably also alludes to the European word “miniature” which comes from the red lead paint border around a small painting to illustrate a text; only later did it come to mean small in size. Pamuk’s approach, creating verbal miniatures himself—the narrative of a dead man, a dog, a gold coin, a horse, two dervishes, the color red, the unidentified murderer, along with the major characters—is delightful, and I loved this creative use of the unreliable narrator. Passages of the book are quite beautiful, but unfortunately most of his characters, except Shekure and the city Istanbul itself, are weakly drawn. The perspectivism of this device pretty clearly shows which side Pamuk is on, even if some characters make a strong case for traditional representation consistent with a conservative interpretation of Islam. But the story devolves into too many repetitively similar philosophical and allegorical discussions of style for my taste (and I love art and philosophy). And as a murder mystery, the book disobeys the basic rule of allowing reasonably attentive readers to figure out the murderer at least by the time you nab him, instead preferring to give misleading clues presumably for the sake of surprise right up to the end. But instead of surprise, the ending just seems contrived. Or perhaps it ironically proves the fundamentalists’ point—that perspectivism destroys one’s ability to find the truth and lets one get away with murder? A rereading might show that I was not attentive enough or just don’t know enough about Turkish culture or certain aspects of Islamic religion to get the clues, but I’m not sure the book, despite its several beauties, will get that rereading. If you are going to read the book, you may be interested in this web site with discussions by art historians that includes some great examples of miniaturist art:. http://www.learner.org/courses/worldl.... or should at least consult a collection of images of Turkish and Persian miniatures, as that time will be better spent. For a different perspective, John Updike gives the book a much more positive review:. http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2001...","Dec 22, 2012"
55749466,Jaimita,"I met a Turkish girl on a plane. We clicked and there ensued an enthralling two-hour conversation on culture, spirituality and religion in Istanbul, India and New York. Fuelled by the curiosity to know more about the Turkish culture, I asked her for a book that might be worth reading. And that is how I got introduced to Orhan Pamuk. Not really knowing what I am getting into, I picked up 'My Name is Red'.. My Name is Red is a colourful infusion of mystery, religion and romance - all set in the times of Pashas and Sultans and miniaturists, when the magnificent and rich cities were Samarkand and Bukhara, the popular ruler was Tamerlane and the great master of Herat was Bihzad and the most romantic tale was Firdausi and Nizami's Husrev and Shirin.. Orhan writes every chapter with a new lens. 'I am Black', 'My Name is Shekure' - with names like this for each chapter, the story shifts perspective among Shekure, Black, Esther, a corpse, a dog, a tree, olive, butterfly, stork and more. I loved reading the perspectives of Shekure and Esther because they presented the emotional lens of women otherwise stifled with a largely male presence.. A miniature is killed, another one is killed, there are three suspects and there is commotion.. And there are stories boxed within this main story. To justify and prove and sometimes to just intellectualise, characters dive into parables of their magnificent kings, of the cities that were, of the lovers that were, of the supreme masters that were, of the pure religion and devotion that was and how painting was now getting degraded by the individualistic style of 'Franks' and 'Venetians'.. Painting for the old masters (old masters originated from Persia, the supreme master Bihzad of Herat was from Persia) was a means to become closer to god, to paint to catch a glimpse of how god perceives the world to be, to try and depict the reality was a heresy (a painting can never be the reality but only a depiction) and a thing of ""Franks"" and ""Venetians"". And that is mostly the dilemma that every character goes through. They see that their own culture is on the downward trend, they know that the portraiture which 'Franks' and 'Venetians' are doing, is the next coming thing. Should they earn good money by imitating the styles of Franks at the cost of losing self-respect and committing 'heresy'? Or as some characters ponder deeply upon whether it really is a heresy?. It is hard for me to rate this book. Because it is not just a book, it has been an experience!. And personally for me, I was blown away when amidst reading all of this, I found the immense cultural exchange between Persia and India. Persian poets and artists trickled down to India under Timurid and Mughal dynasties. Amir Khusro - a beloved and well known Sufi poet in India, has Persian descent and called himself Indo-Turk. The ghazals and qawallis which I listen to every day originated from Sufism founded by Rumi - a Persian poet/Sufi/mystic again! How wonderful it is to know that I, an Indian, am a product of the conglomeration of so many cultures. We have really soaked up every thing that came our way and in the best way possible. Cheers!","Nov 25, 2018"
2327087,Neha,"I have only good things to say about this book. The most unique style of writing, with the story told by multiple narrators in sets. From people to animals, from living to nonliving, from real to symbolic characters - the story develops so many dimensions and point of views, that it nourishes and intrigues you as a reader. The narrators vary from the main characters Black, Esther, Shekure, Butterfly, Stroke, Olive, Orhan, Master Osman, to a corpse, a random Dog, color Red, a painted Horse, the unknown Murderer, to Satan, or just a Woman. Most books have either a protagonist or a third party unbiased narrator of events, but here you have more narrators than characters in the book. The story flows smoothly with each narration, giving others point of view to the same events but without forcing you to take sides or form opinions.. It's a culturally rich book explaining the complex and extinct art of Miniature painting, Royal patrons, religious connotations and conditions, aspiring artists, politics of the workshop and the underlying competition and jealousy. Pamuk's writing takes you straight to the streets of ancient Istanbul and you can visualize the story unfolding in front of your eyes. You are there, when the murder happens, when the murderer is running, when others are being questioned, when people are talking, at the secret wedding, when the masterpieces are being created. But you still can't figure who the murderer is? Pamuk holds your curiosity till the last page.. The book was deep and complex based in an unfamiliar age, genre and setting. Every time I got back to the book I had to choose a silent corner and read at least three to four pages, before its soft sensation warmed my palette. It was like drinking the warm Qahwah (Kashmiri Tea), it had to be warm and steaming to have the soothing effect you wanted. The book too can't be read in a hurry or even warmer.. Hence, a marvelous book.. mystifying and demystifying the ancient world of Miniature art, politics, crime and religion. Some beautiful lines from the book as a food for thought. Each word tells a story.. Read more on. Storywala","Sep 16, 2013"
33592940,Anirban Nanda,"A few observations:. 1. A meditation on the religious, artistic and philosophical conflicts between the East and the West. Whereas East encourages to find happiness amid harmony, West encourages to establish individual identities('style' or 'voice' in other words). Interestingly, for all the 51 chapters of this book, there are separate first person narratives corresponding to different characters. This not only gives the events and views many different perspectives, but also contributes to a completeness of analysis. In other words, by combining so many different voices the book emerges with a singular, harmonious voice, giving a sense of unity or general aspects common to both the worlds; a target the book set out to achieve.. 2. Frequent allusions to legendary artworks during A.D. 1500 give us an idea of that time, their culture and above all their sense of artistry. Cleverly, Pamuk weaves the history intricately and naturally, never allowing it to overshadow the emotional dynamics of the story.. 3. This is a book that focuses on the relation between East and West in a time when Illumination and Illustrative work was at its peak. Hence, it is understandable and quite apt to write book that follows the tradition and essence of a Miniature work. Like an extravagantly detailed work of a master miniaturist, this book is very intricate, detailed, such that you would find a story at any corner.. 4. The easy existence of homosexuality, the natural depiction of sex make it an excellent example of a book that treats sexuality as a book should.. 5. Also, the narrators directly interact with the reader, sometimes creating a diversion, sometimes telling a lie and later confessing (and even apologizing) evoke the old tradition of story-telling (as depicted in the book in coffeehouse) and thereby giving it a quality that every book aspires to have: to be able to become a friend of the reader.","Feb 01, 2017"
4922926,Elise,"I thoroughly enjoyed escaping to mysterious and enchanting 16th century Istanbul in this beautifully written and intelligent murder mystery, love story, adventure tale, and so much more. While this story was told from several characters' perspectives, the format did not take away from its pace, suspense, or appeal. Pamuk is a master at moving the story along and losing nothing but gaining a great deal through the multiple perspectives which were, as one critic described this story's telling, ""kaleidoscopic."" I can't think of a more fitting word for the way Pamuk brings this colorful, richly textured and remote world to life for his readers. However, I will admit that the plot did drag at times when Pamuk was explaining the intricacies (through his character, Master Osman, for example) of miniaturist art and its intersection with Islamic religion, culture, and aesthetics during this period in history, but I enjoyed this too because not only was I emotionally invested in Pamuk's characters and their plights, but I also learned so much. This book is at once a puzzle (which will have you flipping back to previous chapters for clues about each character's painting ""style"" to bring you closer to figuring out who the murderer is) and a page turner, although not a fast read. I don't recommend ""My Name is Red"" for readers looking for a light read. This novel is for intellectually curious readers, thinking people who enjoy being transported and transformed by the books they read.","Jun 22, 2013"
4012900,Azhar,"This is easily my favorite novel this year.. It isn't the first one I've read where each chapter unfolds from the perspective of a different character. But the diversity of perspectives was charming. You see the world as a murdered man, a love-struck Romeo, a murderer, a master artist, a gold coin, the picture of a tree, the color red - life and the afterlife, living and the inanimate, all traditional barriers to storytelling are mashed up in this liberating narrative experience.. Diversity of perspectives is also central to the plot, as it depicts the deep rooted conflict between classical Middle Eastern miniature art and the rise of European art styles. Indeed, the dividing line is so sharp that it leads to murder - and the delightful part is, throughout the novel you know that one of three possible characters are the murderers, and then you go through a number of chapters from the eye of the murderer, yet the author withholds enough information in those chapters so you don't discover till the very end who the murderer is.. Love, too, is a central element in the play, as the unwavering force of Black's love a la Mejnun duels with the volatility of Shekure's affections, torn between her dead husband, an unstable brother-in-law and the hopelessly infatuated protagonist.. It is not an easy read, especially for those of us unacquainted to medieval artistic movements, yet this is what makes it worth coming back to contemplating upon.. Looking forward to more works of this delightful craftsman.","Nov 26, 2014"
231580,Isabelle,"This is a very smart novel: set at the critical time where Western Renaissance art has started to infiltrate and threaten the traditional miniature art of Turkey, the book is at times a mystery, at times a memoir on art, at times a love story, and very often a running commentary on Turkey. I am sure that I do not know enough about Turkey, past and present, its history, its politics and its art to fully understand the depth of the book. It was a challenging book, and I did find myself re-reading certain passages to make sure I was getting most of the nuances. I also liked the construction of the book: small chapters, each narrated by one of the characters, often going over the same event from a different point of view. Needless to say, I was not able to solve the crime, or should I say the murder, as there are many crimes committed throughout the book, most of them moral, artistic, mystical and religious. There was a whole sequence taking place in the sultan's treasury that I found disturbing and almost scary in a fanatical sort of way.. I was so thrown off by the book and challenged by Pamuk's thinking that I cannot wait to read another of his books. I do think I will pick a more contemporary setting as it might be easier to bridge the cultural gap.","Oct 02, 2007"
55523193,Mila,"“To God belongs the East and the West. May he protect us from the will of the pure and unadulterated.”. Set in 16th Century Ottoman Empire, “My Name is Red” is concerned with the conflict between eastern tradition and westernization. This conflict is expressed through a series of murders around a mysterious book which subverts the codes of the pictorial art of miniature by introducing western techniques and therefore challenging an undefiled conception of islamic religion.. If the questions raised by the books find a strong echo in our 21th Century world, it seems logical to see them penned by a Turkish author, Turkey being the gateway between East and West and a country divided between its progressive inheritance and the weight of fundamentalist Islam.. Pamuk shares with Eco the ability to write a book with best-seller potential that is yet demanding and sophisticated. My Name is Red is simultaneously a gripping murder mystery, a historical novel, a thoughtful meditation on art and a playful modernist novel interweaving different narrators, calling out to its reader.. “Open your eyes, discover why the enemies of the life in which you believe, of the life you’re leaving, and of Islam, have destroyed me.”","Feb 10, 2017"
4999879,LindaJ^,"Red is the color of blood and quite a bit of it was spilled in this literary thriller. But, for me, Red was the name of a color used by the miniaturists in their drawings, and an interesting color it was. This book is a thriller, starting with a murder. But while it had sufficient action related to the thriller plot line, it also felt like a dissertation on Eastern art and how, at the time where the story takes place - the late 16th century - how Western art was starting to influence Eastern art. The style was unusual - no two adjacent chapters had the same narrator and sometimes the narrator was an animal or an inanimate object.. What made it drag for me was the repeated discussion of Eastern art and its masters. I did not know the historical figures and books being referenced, so found that hard to relate to. And I wasn't motivated, as I sometimes am when I encounter new-to-me history, to do any research. (If it had been ceramics and the painting style used, I might well have spent sometime doing homework.) Also, the characters, especially the younger ones, were mostly caricatures. I wouldn't have wanted any of them as friends.","Nov 09, 2016"
2006699,Tariq Mahmood,"Orhan is a master story teller.. 'Does love make one a fool or do only fools fall in love?' His prose read like poetry. I was taken on a mythical journey to a world where calligraphers and miniaturists reigned supreme. A world where every artist dreams of becoming a master. Where every master secretly dreams of rivalling God, the ultimate creator master of all. And where blindness achieved through hard work and dedication is a natural outcome of hard work and dedication. This book is an absolute must if you want to really understand the object of Islamic art of the Ottoman, Safavid and Moghul (Indian) eras. Why are idols derided in Islam? What can love teach us? Why is there so much focus on beauty in symmetry?. The story reads like a modern crime thriller, complete with a righteous serial killer and lovely independent women whose fate are intertwined with the frantic guild of the artistic ethos of the time. This makes the novel extremely easy to read.. Time doesn't flow if you don't dream.","Sep 17, 2013"

The mystery was intriguing and was what kept me reading, I certainly did not work our who done it. The love story was not that interesting and I did not like Shekure, she was very manipulative and did not seem to know what she wanted. It read like a art history book a lot of the time and although interesting to start with, I soon tired of it, if felt like this book could have been a lot shorter. It would have been great if this book had some illustrations to help with the descriptions of the pictures, but then I guess that would have made it even longer!!","Mar 08, 2012"

The love story was better I suppose, but Shekure is deliberately written 'not quite as she was', so I can't believe in her either.. My stars are for the trip into book-art. Ottoman art cast its eyes back and to the east, to the 'masters of Herat' and the great illuminated manuscripts of the Persian Book of Kings. We have tales from the 13th-15th centuries when Turks and Mongols roiled and book-arts flourished: I read on for these. Any novel that mentions Mehmet Black Pen, painter of demons and the everyday (from Turkestan, 15thC) needs stars..

27606335,Horia Bura,"Pamuk is a very good writer and the Nobel Prize won was one worth it, there's no doubt here. I think the most relevant element one could notice when reading this novel is the author's perfect ability of mastering phrasing, that unique way of choosing the right words in the right places (a thing that I could also say about Julian Barnes' writing). Moreover, this Turkish author is a complete artisan of building his novel, giving much attention to its structure, characters and narrative line. In my opinion, ""My Name is Red"" brings into question the eternal disjunction between old vs. new, sacred vs. profane, stability vs. change, inflexibility vs. adaptation. Although it took me a while to finish it and I had some bottlenecks in reading, I must admit that the world of miniaturists as described here is kind of fascinating and the parts about God, art, style etc are some of the best I have ever read in a work of fiction.","Feb 03, 2014"

But if that was all there was to this book my enjoyment would be severely limited. Instead there is more including a story of an oriental mystery: In Istanbul, in the late 1590s, the Sultan secretly commissions a great book: a celebration of his life and his empire, to be illuminated by the best artists of the day - in the European manner. But when one of the miniaturists goes missing and is feared murdered, their master seeks outside help. There is also embedded within the miniaturists and their stories and digressions the wonder of literature itself, of the nature of books and of their impact on life, culture and history. This makes for a great book that I would recommend to all.","Jan 15, 2009"

I realised it was more philosophical in nature, exploring art and its place in Islam and the nature of love and all that. I knew what I was going to read and I enjoyed what I was reading but it just wasn't enjoyable enough.. My rule of thumb is, if a book cannot keep my attention away from other books in my ""to-read"" pile, then it's not worth the time to finish it.. My Name Is Red. is such a book.

In the Faulknerian (Faulkner-esque?) tradition, it paints a narrative in layers, with each chapter an account from the point of view of a different character. Everyone has a voice, from incorrigible gossips and forlorn lovers to a painting of a tree and death itself.. Here's a gem from Pamuk:. ""A city's intellect ought to be measured not by its scholars, libraries, miniaturists, calligraphers and schools but by the number of crimes insidiously committed on its dark streets over thousands of years. By this logic, doubtless, Istanbul is the world's most intelligent city.""","Aug 01, 2007"

This book, in contrast, really drew me in, though I suspect I didn't fully appreciate its subtleties. Pamuk seems to be making a point about closed societies and taboos here, and there's ostensibly a murder mystery at the center of the tale, which is told from multiple perspectives. This layered telling builds up a nuanced picture of the society, and there's considerable intellectual heft to the material, which ranges through art history, court life, religious doctrine, and a host of other subjects.

I say sort-of, because although the plot definitely features a murdered artist, and his group of colleagues, one of whom killed him - which one, we do not find out till the very end - the book as a whole is more concerned with the differences between Western and Eastern traditional art, which in turn reflects on the differences between cultures - and with the culture of Turkish Islam, in general. And - I found it to be a bit surprising - I also found it to be subtly but viciously critical of that culture..

35648135,Nidhi,"It's a Turkish novel on the time frame of Ottoman empire in 1591, the story set in Istanbul. The combination of mystery + art + religion + love story + historical fiction. Well let's just say not everyone will like it considering the length to which it was discussed with philosophical theme about how a person perceives different topics.. There are various narrators and the absurdity with which they would directly talk to the reader will catch your attention. Also the fact that the narrator thinks the reader just didn't read last few pages to understand what's going on, so they have to clarify their intentions in case the reader(you) take matters in your own hand. Religious basis with idolatry play a very vital part in some narrator's way of living and thinking which shapes the discourse the story takes.. .. Regarding the story - the illumination art is the basic life of the characters- 'the minisaturists'- in which they are spending their lives to create the work for the Sultan, refuge of the world. In which 1 artwork is all about circumcision ceremony of the prince, which was referenced numerous times. The other major artwork is which causes all the fuss, since art is the way of reaching to the one and only. So if it is to be messed with, then you get a long 671 pages book. The fuss includes how western culture is taking a prominent shape in minds of people hence destroying the image of the illustrating art which is being taught and practiced throughout the lives of miniaturists.. .. Well that was the story. The other things which were a character sketch were, wait for it, obviously men who shape everything around them. Who attains wisdom of the world and apply it the lives of each and every living/dead/inanimate things on earth. Somehow apparently many have huge crushes on their apprentice in which the age gap toxicity reaches to a point where a 119 year old is in love with a 16 year old. So there's that to vomit about.. The women are the only real thing with whom you will see as an outsiders. They are there as slaves and non slaves -belonging to the father, husband or the family of dead husband. Still -Shekure takes her decisions in the little space she was allowed to have + her manipulative love story where the man claiming to love her will behave viciously for not performing acts he wants + her being a mother figure to 30+ grown ass man. There is Esther who is infact the most independent of all and is a part of everyone's lives with some actual human knowledge and qualities.. Everyone distrust everyone. Everyone somehow are all gossip mongers. Sometimes you will think you are reading an art illustration. Sometimes the absurdity of the devil taking all dark actions which were actually conscious human actions, but you know what i mean. Its an interesting read with many things still commonly seen as humans are constant, just times have changed. The thing you won't like are the philosophical parables which are meant to explain things but just are there. Fast read, translation is good, some readers will see the writing style read somewhere and you won't feel out of place with the theme.","Jul 28, 2018"
54686045,Sam,"I was recommended to read this book by a shop owner when I was in Selçuk, Turkey, in 2018. We were discussing Kurdish history in Turkey, and I learned that Pamuk was charged for the public denigration of Turkish identity due to his remarks made in an interview regarding Armenian and Kurdish genocide. Completing this novel had a lot of significance to me because of the shop owner's passion for this book and the conversation we had. Unfortunately, this book took me very long to complete and had a few difficult areas. In addition to this, if you are someone who cannot stand ""men writing women"", you will dread a few moments in this book.. Regardless, I thought that. My Name is Red. was beautifully written. The amount of detail for each character's perspective never came off wordy. Details had meaning and it was very easy to become immersed in Istanbul's Ottoman court.. I don't want to be a tree, I want to be its meaning.. It's all about perspective. Is the subject of an illustration depicted the way it was at that time? Can we trust what is in an illustration to be true? I find it very interesting that the possible inaccuracies in how subjects are portrayed can alter history, even in today's mediums.. Every chapter will make you question the murder mystery. Who will you sympathize with? I'm still contemplating.","Nov 18, 2019"
20234777,June,"The opening narrator is called The Corpse who is suitably angry at the man responsible for his death. This setup captivated my interest and attention. It becomes clear that his work as a miniaturist is key to solving the crime. But instead of a straightforward whodunnit, the bulk of this novel explores miniaturist art and religion, mainly Islam. The bulk of this book is about art, religion and the philosophy of art. We get a view of afterlife based on two murdered characters. There are even unusual narrators which was fascinating and appealing for me. But this book was became a challenge as I know nothing about art, or Turkish history. I was willing to persist as the writing is good. But the coarse sexual content was too much for me. This accompanied by the repetitive content of some characters which didn’t add value to the story for me. Overall, I thought there was great potential to learn about Turkish culture and a bit about art. But this was not the book for me.","Apr 02, 2019"

What amazes me is the amount of research Pamuk did on the art and culture of this period especially the miniaturists. Each chapter is written from different angles of individuals in the book. So you get to read the different angles of the same situation from different individuals. I have never read a book of this sort of presentation.

89242656,Diana,"My Name is Red [1998/2001] – ★★★★★. “Why does man not see things? He is himself standing in the way: he conceals things.” “What are man’s truths ultimately? Merely his irrefutable errors“. (Friedrich Nietzsche). In My Name is Red by Nobel Laureate Orhan Pamuk, murder of one miniaturist – Elegant Effendi – was committed within the circle of miniaturists working for the Sultan in medieval Istanbul. At the same time, thirty-six year old Black returns to his hometown of Istanbul after his twelve years’ absence to seek once again the hand of his beloved Shekure, an opportunity that was denied to him twelve years previously. Unwittingly, Black becomes entangled in the intrigues of miniaturists working under Enishte Effendi, Black’s uncle and Shekure’s father. Masterfully, Pamuk takes us deep within the art circle of medieval craftsmen who labour to produce a mysterious new book, a circle repleted with professional jealousy, narcissism, hidden love and, above all, differences as so the proper way of painting and representing pictures under one strict religious canon. In this historical novel, Persian art-forms clash violently with rising Venetian art influences as Black starts to realise that, in order to find the murderer of Elegant Effendi, it is necessary to go deep into the worldviews and art opinions of each of the three suspected miniaturists – “Stork”, “Olive” and “Butterfly”, testing their loyalties and beliefs. It is impossible not to get swept away by this novel of great insight and intelligence. My Name is Red is like a rich, tightly-woven exotic tapestry whose secrets lie in elaborate details, red herrings and in the depth of the soul of its maker, celebrating the beauty, imagination and intelligence of ancient artworks and methods of painting.. First of all, My Name is Red is an intriguing murder-mystery that plays with the reader, challenging him or her to identify the murderer before they reach the end. There are some clues as to the identity of the murderer scattered about in the narrative as we read about secrets that harbour the four great miniaturists – “Stork”, “Olive”, “Butterfly” and murdered Elegant Effendi – while working for the Sultan through both Master Osman and Enishte Effendi. These two masters have different views about the rise in popularity of Venetian art-forms and their influence on their traditional methods of painting. Who could have killed Elegant Effendi? Another jealous miniaturist? Or maybe a religious fanatic dissatisfied with the way the four miniaturists started working on a new book in secrecy? What is the nature of the new book commissioned by the Sultan? Was it really designed to depict images that go contrary to Islamic faith? Black soon finds himself tasked not only with winning Shekure and her father’s affection, but also finding the murderer as another murder is committed soon afterwards and Shekure feels torn between her allegiance to her brother-in-law (as matrimonial law dictates since her husband has not been declared legally dead) and her devotion to her father. Black realises that, to know the identity of the murderer, it is necessary to go to the earliest foundations of Persian art, its inspirations and consider the nature of its relationship with its western counterpart. Pictures start to speak volumes in the book as Black discovers how past artworks shaped the present miniaturists’ styles and it is here that the answer to the murder puzzle may lie.. Two previous books that I reviewed – Mohsin Hamid’s Moth Smoke [2000] and Elif Shafak’s 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World [2019] can be compared to My Name is Red since the three most likely drew inspiration from a common source/literary tradition. “Coincidentally”, Shafak’s book 10 Minutes 38 Seconds begins the same way as Pamuk’s My Name is Red – one spirit of a dead person starts talking to us, explaining their curious position and seeking retribution. In My Name is Red, the spirit of dead Elegant Effendi, whose corpse was thrown into a well, starts to recall his life and we get to know his professional circle. Also, as in Mohsin Hamid’s Moth Smoke, My Name is Red presents its story from the multitude of viewpoints, each competing for our attention as we read on and each trying to convince us with its rightness. If in Moth Smoke, there were only three or four other perspectives, in My Name is Red there are perspectives of Black, Shekure, Esther, Enishte Effendi, Master Osman, the three remaining miniaturists, not to mention the perspectives of inanimate objects and animals. The book results in a psychologically-intense ride that presents curious (sometimes black humour) situations that are recounted from different points of view. It is as though Pamuk does not let us see the wood for the trees – as we read on, we are blinded or diverted by different subjective opinions which do not let us see the broader picture or “objective” truth. Paradoxically, we, as readers, are both omniscient as to what is going on and “blind” at the same time because, even though we are cognisant of what is going on in the minds of each of the narrators, we are not told the most important thing and get lost in numerous details of the narration.. Secondly, My Name is Red is a deep reflection on the nature and the making of art – on its outside influences and development. Pamuk pits the Eastern tradition of art presentation (that puts emphasis on repetition and on the anonymity of artists) against the Western influence (including signatures and portraiture). Many characters in the novel lament the growing “westernisation” of their art, fearing what will be the final consequence regarding their religion and traditions. Something is being lost in their loyalty and devotion to Allah as art starts imitating life too closely (only Allah can be the source of all true creations) and certain unworthy personages take the central stage in paintings. There are also fears of Ottoman art’s historic roots and old masters’ methods being forgotten and ignored through the vanity of certain miniaturists who want to leave their own signatures or new styles behind. Thus, amidst the murder-mystery, there are also fables told on painters’ styles being equated with mistakes and on the admirable nature of blindness for artists as Black tries to make sense of this paradox of the trade of making pictures in a Muslim city, hoping it will lead him to the murderer: “the sincerity of the miniaturist….doesn’t emerge in moments of talent and perfection; on the contrary, it emerges through slips of the tongue, mistakes, fatigues and frustration” [Pamuk/Göknar: 1998/2001: 243]; “what exposes us is not the subject, which others have commissioned from us…but the hidden sensibilities we include in the painting as we render that subject” [Pamuk/Göknar: 1998/2001: 422]; “a great painter does not content himself by affecting us with his masterpieces; ultimately he succeeds in changing the landscape of our minds” [Pamuk/Göknar: 1998/2001: 258]. Pamuk lets us step within the beautiful paintings of the old masters of the Ottoman Empire and we walk through the armies and lovers gazing at each other across the distance, enabling our imagination to fuse with the best paintings made in the Middle East.. There is a third aspect to My Name is Red. We get to know Shekure, the beautiful daughter of Enishte Effendi, quite well – her husband is presumed dead after he marched to war four years ago and she is left with her two young sons. The arrival of Black disrupts her brother-in-law Hasan’s courtship of her and we realise that Black has always been passionately in love with Shekure…or has he? Here, art creeps in once again and life starts imitating art. The subjective nature of love is linked to the subjective viewing of artworks, and Black and Shekure’s courtship is linked to one of the oldest Persian fables – Hüsrev and Shirin by Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi, as well as to the falling in love with the presentation of the image of one’s beloved first: “love…must be understood, not through the logic, but through its illogic” [1998/2001: 658]. The colour red subtly creeps in and repeats itself where we find ourselves closer to truth. Red stands for blood and violence, but also for passion as Black’s lust becomes uncontrollable even though his heart remains “pure” like that of a child: “for if a lover’s face survives emblazoned on your heart, the world is still your home” [1998/2001: 49]. Satan and Death both have their say in this book too – “what we essentially want is to draw something unknown to us in all its shadowiness, not something we know in all its illumination” [1998/2001: 202], and, by the end, the book becomes one unforgettable adventure into the mysteries of art, life, love and death.. The conclusion is that My Name is Red, translated from the Turkish by Erdağ Göknar, is an evocative, richly-layered and vivid murder-mystery with one unusual structure that immerses us into the mysteries of Ottoman paintings and in the atmosphere of medieval Istanbul. It is a true page-turner steeped in the history of the Ottoman art where fables and reality, as well as life and art, inexplicably merge to produce a one-of-a-kind story.","Mar 31, 2020"

4146169,Karishma,"My Name is Red is a book I've owned for nearly seven years and not got around to reading till recently. It was fitting that it had come out when it did, soon after the Twin Towers fell and the American war on terror began.. Of course, the book is set in Istanbul at the time of the European Renaissance and when Emperor Akbar of India, poised as a patron of all art ensured a time of peace and prosperity that attracted artists from far and wide.. The book within the book is commissioned by the Turkish Sultan and is supposed to demonstrate his power to the Italians and the miniaturists preparing it in secret, are assigned to mimic the individualistic perspectival style of the Renaissance masters instead of the classical Islamic miniature painting style where pictures were accessories to words in books, a mere extension of the text, almost like border engravings.. This is the source of much conflict and contemplating within the book and also the subject of its most moving passages.. There are the miniaturists devoted to their art of painting by attempting perfection like the old Persian masters practiced, but also craving distinction, they envy the Europeans their individual style, which placed subjects at the centre of the universe and allowed the artist to become ambitious and pioneering, then there are the master miniaturists who try and fail to walk a line between the new and the old, the East and the West, their persecutors the hardline preachers and clerics who claim that Allah does not condone painting, or music or even, coffee and there's the Sultan who like all political leaders in history , cares more about showing off his power than any actual stylistic revolution in art.. The book itself is written in the individual style the Turks anguish about. Each chapter from the point of view of a different person, which means some chapters are profound and others hopelessly mundane - an effect that makes one wonder if it was intentional.. I did enjoy the book but somehow felt it would have been better in the original and loses something in translation.. Istanbul or Constantinople as it was once called, is a fascinating place, located at the intersection of the East and the West, torn in two directions and enriched by rivaling civilisations, as it struggles to balance the modern with the traditional. It's an interesting conflict, more than familiar to someone of my nationality and age.. To paint as one sees, or as God sees. To paint the object or its meaning. To follow the East or the West - these are questions the people in the book pose to themselves and each other till a character quotes from the Koran - to God belongs the East and the West.. And never the twain do meet.","Aug 13, 2010"
4174950,Elizabeth Sulzby,"I have just finished reading My Name is Red and am now going back and tracing the murderer character through his/her strands (his/her so as not to spoil the mystery for other readers). Then I want to use the chronology at the end of the book to compare with the stories that the various characters tell about the development of illumination of texts within the development of Islam as Pamuk puts these strands together in this book.. I had a hard time getting into the book and had to reread the first 4-5 chapters to get started. Then the book grabbed me and I read straight through. I listed it as fiction but also as philosophy/religion. I should list it as art history as well. While I read it I was listening to audio CD's of Proust's Swann's Way which I had read in hardback when I was in college. Both books are very complex in weaving together the stories of a number of characters embedded in culture and memory.. I have read The Museum of Innocence, Snow, Silent House and next will read Other Colors, all by Pamuk. I read the first three before I went to Istanbul this past September. Turning to My Name is Red which is set in Istanbul in the 16th Century let me re-vision Istanbul back in history. Some of the events happen near the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, and the Hippodrome, for instance.. I was fascinated by the time that Black and the Master Illuminator Osman spent in the archives of the Shah in the Treasury at Topkapi Palace. These archives contained a huge collection of illuminated books from across centuries--within which Black and Master Osman search for clues to solve the mystery around which their innocence depends. If Black in particular cannot prove his innocence by finding evidence of the guilty murderer, then he and the other artists will have to be tortured to lead to ""the truth"" of the guilty party. I was struck by Master Osman's fascination of a collection of paintings of forms of torture which Pamuk describes in gruesome length. Then the Master reflects that he and his fellow apprentices were tortured by their masters in order to keep their art pure and becoming more proficient!. There is a love story which I found strange, annoying, and still intriguing. One of the comments on the back of the book compares Pamuk's writings to Borges but I compared this love story more to Marcel Marquez in 100 Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera.","Sep 15, 2010"

15024040,Jenn,"This is a most curious and fascinating thriller, vividly portraying 16th century Istanbul at the height of the Ottoman Empire. It’s many stories in one – a murder mystery, a portrayal of the claustrophobic world of the miniaturist and the tensions between east and west, a love affair, a description of the sumptuous and terrifying court of the Sultan and a tribute to dazzling Istanbul.. I loved it, confusing at times because it is such a distant world to a 21st century westerner, but if you want to be transported away into another place this is your book. It could be described as a Muslim `Name of the Rose’. The story revolves around the conflict facing the Miniaturists when their traditional and very stylised method of art comes up against the European Renaissance. Miniaturists would be selected from boyhood and then would spend an arduous period of apprenticeship learning their craft. They would devote their lives to their art, following strict protocols and traditions and probably ruining their eyes in the process. It helped I like art anyway, so was very open to hearing about the intricate techniques, colours and the stories of artists across the Islamic world.. Apparently the Sultan of the time was an art lover. His name was Sultan Murad III, 1546-1595 – roughly contemporary with Elizabeth I of England (and in fact they mention a present from the English monarch at one point). The Ottoman Empire was the gateway to the East, immensely powerful and juxtaposed to maritime Venice. I read somewhere there was expected to be a showdown during this period between East and West, Islam and Christianity. Erasmus predicted the total destruction of one party or another, but it never happened, each side settling for rivalry in trade instead.. The story centres on the murder of one Miniaturist – was it done by a religious fundamentalist? Or was it for professional jealousy? Parmuk writes each chapter from a different viewpoint, even having the murderer’s viewpoint on a few occasions. Interspersed with this are descriptions of Istanbul – which personally I loved, a most interesting city. He really takes you back to the narrow courtways, the linden trees, coffee houses, the Jewish quarter - I do like books when you can immerse yourself in the place being written about, and `My Name is Red’ certainly achieves that.","Nov 22, 2016"

29160274,Czarny Pies,"It is August 20, 2014. I had an ""Orhan Pamuk"" at lunch today when I decided to go to neighbourhood Shawarma joint for lunch. My purpose was to practice my German with the owner who is a Kurd who had been educated in Munich. Today, however, he was too upset to have any patience for my feeble efforts in German. Instead he was very upset by the plight of the Yazidis in his homeland.. He explained to me: ""Something needs to be done to protect the Yazidis. We were all once Zoroastrians. The Iraqis should not be attacking these people. They should respect them and leave them in peace."". This is essentially the big theme of ""My name is Red"". Muslims who have chosen to live in Western society ask themselves to what extent their identity derives from the fact that they are Muslims given the fact that they were once before something else. There are in fact no indigenous Muslims. Those in the Middle East had been Christians prior to the rise of Islam whereas in Iran and much of the neighbouring territories, they had been Zoroastrians.. The second question facing the Westernized muslim is what to do with the Muslim component of his or her identity in a secular society. What should be retained and what can be dropped without compromising fundamental principles.. My Name is Red examines the confrontation between an non-Islamic artistic style and a strain of Islam that wished to imposes its views on art whether or not God really wanted as much..

39033898,Gohar Khokhar,"for me this was the first time reading a novel written in a style in which every character is speaking to you, and i liked this style, as it helped me in building a better connection with every character.. i believe this is not a book which you can finish in two days, it requires time and careful reading and as in my case where i am not at all familiar with painting and other related stuff, i had to keep my focus to absorb the fine details.. To enjoy the book you should picture yourself as someone having a cup of coffee and listening to a friend across a table. This is a must read novel for all those who have interest in painting/ sketching etc. Specially young artists growing up in central Asia, middle east and south Asia must read this. I am sure they will understand few things quicker than many other.. This book introduces reader with Islamic style of paintings and how that is different from western style or as in the novel it is called Venetian style. Before reading this, i saw miniature art many times but i never realise the depth in them, i never thought about the reason behind the development of this form of art. i never thought the stories hidden in them, it has introduced me to a wonderful form of art and for that i am grateful to orhan.. In addition to a book on art, i also consider this a book in which the concept behind the use of certain color, certain way of sketching, certain style of painting and use of certain tools is explained in a different way.. after reading this i realised that majority of artist across globe now follows Venetian style which was presented as something substandard and against the Islamic principle throughout the book.","Sep 08, 2015"
4903281,Philippe,"I read this book a couple of years ago in rather unusual circumstances. I was on a ski expedition in a very remote area in the Himalayas. For weeks our small group was completely cut off from human civilization. I didn’t bring the book but my tentmate did. It was my first encounter with Pamuk. Initially I was captivated. The author’s deftness in conjuring up a strange, exotic world made a deep impression. But as my reading progressed I became nervous and very frustrated. The narrative’s labyrinthine quality and the opulence of its setting oppressed me. There may have been an unanticipated interaction with the extraordinary environment we found ourselves in. We had been in this glacier basin for weeks, steadily climbing to a high pass. It was a landscape unlike anything I had seen. Also the rarefied air caused me problems. I slept fitfully, plagued by persistent nightmares. At one point I dreamed about Pamuk’s ‚Red’. Not literally, but there was no doubt in my mind that the novel had worked its way into my subconscious. The dream was a visceral experience of Derrida’s ‚infinite play’: disorienting and exhausting, but in equal measures philosophically insightful. Since I have been thoroughly apprehensive of reading another book by Pamuk. But it is also true that very few novels have had this kind of impact on me. The mere association with Pamuk stirs strong emotions. At one point I will have the courage to break the spell. But not quite yet.","Aug 11, 2014"
56111782,B Sarv,"I started reading this Nobel Prize winning novel with a bit of apprehension. Lately, since I’ve been writing reviews of a lot of books, while I am reading I try to picture what it is I will write as I am going along. But it was a little intimidating to think of how I might review a novel which had won the highest accolade in modern literature. For me the approach to telling the story is one of the main things that gripped me. In addition, it has a murder mystery, romance and intrigue. By the time I finished I realized that it was a novel that captured and illuminated many aspects of human behavior and it had piqued my curiosity.. While the idea of “breaking the fourth wall” generally refers to performances in theatre or movies, Mr. Pamuk employs this device throughout his novel. In every chapter characters and even inanimate objects (which are sometimes the main character of the chapter) address the reader directly. And so we hear from the corpse, the murderer (even though his identity is not immediately revealed), a coin, death, a tree, the love struck, and other characters critical to the story. Perhaps it was the way the reader is directly addressed that, in part, attracted the attention of the Nobel Prize committee. As I mentioned above, it is certainly one of the things that captured my attention. The story is set in the late 1500s in Istanbul, Turkey. This setting and era may set up challenges to the reader; more on this later.. One example of “breaking the fourth wall” is when the reader is addressed by a coin; a coin which happens to be a counterfeit. The coin describes all of its adventures since it was minted; a description which makes me want to wash my hands every time I handle money. As it is reflecting upon its existence the coin tells the reader, “Many of the people who hold me want to be rid of me as soon as possible, especially if they discover I’m fake. Nonetheless, I have yet to come across someone who’ll warn an unsuspecting buyer that I’m counterfeit. A broker, not recognizing that I’m counterfeit, who has counted out 120 silver coins in exchange for me, will berate himself in fits of anger, sorrow and impatience as soon as he learns he’s been cheated, and these fits won’t subside until he rids himself of me by cheating another. During this crisis, even as he attempts to repeatedly swindle others, failing each time on account of his haste and anger, he’ll continue all the while to curse the “immoral” person who originally conned him.” (p. 105). Here the author not only captures the perspective of the coin in an imaginative and creative manner, he uses the opportunity to make a humorous commentary on human behavior. This is but a small of example of the intriguing nature of this novel.. A character named Black Effendi is the protagonist of the story. (Effendi is a title of respect in Turkey) The action of the story centers on his efforts to renew his courtship of his younger cousin, who was married and widowed during his 12-year exile from Istanbul (for proclaiming his love for her). In the story he is also tasked with identifying the murderer of his uncle (the second murder in the story). In the opening of a chapter entitled “I am called Black” the character reveals something of himself: “Maybe you’ve understood by now that for men like myself, that is, melancholy men for whom love, agony, happiness and misery are just excuses for maintaining eternal loneliness, life offers neither great joy nor great sadness. I’m not saying we can’t relate to other souls overwhelmed by these feelings, on the contrary, we sympathize with them. What we cannot fathom is the odd disquiet our souls sink into at such times. This silent turmoil dims our intellects and dampens our hearts, usurping the place reserved for the true joy and sadness we ought to experience.” (p. 245). I was so struck by this passage that I re-read it several times. I reflected how profoundly, to me, this author had captured such a relatable aspect of life.. Later, when confronted with the murderer Black engages in the following exchange:. “God willing, one day, we will fearlessly tell the story of our own lives that way we actually live them.”. “All fables are everybody’s fables,” said Black. “All illumination is God’s illumination too.” I said, completing the verse by the poet Hatifi of Herat.”. Two aspects of this exchange merit comment. First, is the idea that “All fables are everybody’s fables” struck me at the time as being an important truth. That in every story there are threads that link all human beings with every other human being. And perhaps that is the appeal of novels – the extended stories that we read appeal to something in ourselves – how our own story connects or diverges from the story we are reading. The second is the murderer’s reference to a poet from Herat (a city in Afghanistan). This reference leads me to one of the other main points of interest to me that arose while reading this book.. This is a work of historical fiction that is remarkable to me for its detail. Throughout the story, like the reference I comment on above, the author makes frequent allusions to events in the history of the Ottoman Empire and nations, peoples and empires surrounding it. In the process I realized that there is an enormous gap in my knowledge of world history. I tried not to spend too much time researching the events the author alluded to because I knew that if I did that I would probably spend the whole year reading this book. Still, this did pique my interest in learning more about that history. I simply dislike being completely unaware of the subject.. In addition, the author made frequent allusions to, poetry, literature, myths and legends, apparently well known at that time, from the perspectives of the characters in the book. One which made frequent appearance was the legend of Husrev and Shirin. Its repeated appearance in the novel compelled me to read something about this legend in order to become familiar with the allusion. I was glad that I did so, as it was an interesting story. Still, I was left with many other allusions to legends that would be familiar to the people in that setting which I did not pursue. My curiosity is not dimmed, so I need only time, energy and resources to learn more. I think this novel has something for anyone who enjoys murder mystery, romance and a new and different way of looking at oneself and the world we share with others. I recommend this book.","Oct 30, 2019"
107133539,Teagan Cameron,"Overall, this book was intriguing and brilliantly executed. I learned a great deal about the Ottoman Empire by reading it while reading a beautiful novel. Admittedly the structure of the novel is a bit odd, but I got used to it very quickly and it only enhanced the reading experience. The first chapter, written from the perspective of the corpse, hooks the reader from the very first sentence and reveals the main conflict of the novel very early on. The conflict, that between old values and those of the European world, still resonates today; however, the setting of 1591 Istanbul provides added dimensions to this conflict. The subtle details of the novel from the historical reality allow the reader to inhabit the world in which the characters live and bring it to vivid life. The reader is permitted to use this context as a mirror to view the central tensions in their own life, gaining insight on its form through the perspectives of different characters.. As I read it for a class, my focus was largely on the novel's historical qualities and details, which only enhance its message. I have recommended this to others and will continue to do so, both to lovers of literature and to students of history.","Dec 27, 2019"
7278262,Sher,"This book gets a 5 for creativity and innovation, but it was a chore to read. Each chapter is short or long and titled ""I am called Black"" or ""I am a woman, "" or ""I am called Butterfly."" Each chapter is a different voice and a different point of view, And some of the narrators are noticeable unreliable, which is part of the art form of the writer. It's a mystery, but not in the normal sense. The book is about traditional art forms (art that copied the great masters and did not show any innovation) compared to innovation and personal style being reflected in art. It's about this conflict present in illustration and miniaturist painting before the Renaissance. Each chapter has something to do with this theme, and all around it are the lives of the master engravers, their lovers, their opinions on this highly charged topic. I read this during a time of being forced to read various other dense books for school, so I was hoping for something a little lighter. It's a real work of literary art, but it's a chore to read, and for me - it was just okay. I still may try another Pamuk-- later in the year","Jan 09, 2014"
36030,Kecia,"Dense and lush. It's a murdery mystery. It's a love story. All set against a backdrop of a changing world.. While Europe was in the dark ages the Islamic world flourished. Then came the Italian renaissance. This story is set against the tension of this changing world. The conservative Turks holding desparately to their art tradition. Looking to their relegion to justify their position. All the while they are seduced by what the more progressive West had to offer. They fully understand that the art world has shifted and that they are being left behind, but they are not ready to fully embrace this new idea of a personal style.. This book is not for everyone. It's long and can be dry from time to time. But the plot does move along quickly. Each chapter is told from the POV of a different character which keeps it interesting to me. I enjoyed reading about Eastern vs Western art from the Eastern perspective, but some people may not.. I'm looking forward to reading more from Pamuk after this one.","Apr 09, 2012"
2338568,B. Asma,"People who like art will like this novel set in 1591 Istanbul. Based in history, this fictional account of conflict between traditional miniature painting and innovative perspectival representation recreates the late-sixteenth-century Ottomans. Other people preferring an uninterrupted narrative without an artistic or historical partiality will find several chapter-hopping narrators and an unreliable narrator a bit of a stop-and-go and a constant reorienting. For all that, the characters captivate by their illogical, fiendish, human weaknesses and their blissful joy in the worlds of miniaturization and love.. This is a who-done-it without the clean, crisp edges of Sherlock Holmes. It is messy and indirect getting to the heart of the matter, but Pamuk applies his unlimited imagination, literary technique, and period knowledge to excellent effect. It all seems very real-to-life.","Mar 07, 2012"

This is one really complicated novel. Set in sixteenth-century Ottoman Empire, it opens with a corpse speaking from the bottom of a well, wondering if anyone's noticed his disappearance yet. Orhan Pamuk uses numerous first-person narrators, including a dog, a tree, a gold coin, and the color red. When a second murder occurs, the dead man's daughter agrees to marry a childhood friend, but only if he'll find the murderer.. It's a book that lends itself to discussion, in part just to figure out what's going on, and to share in the research of religion and culture, ideas assumed by the writer to be known, but which left me wondering how much I was missing..

Pamuk is a fantastic writer, using a style and words that only can be compared to the detailed drawings his main characters put on paper in the story. Pamuk takes the time to describe what's going on, both around his characters and in their heads.. He chose an interesting viewpoint by having a different 'I' in each chapter, even including a coin, a dog a color, hence the title, and death.

63131915,Fatima,"This a beautifully intricate story depicting a whole era and culture of miniature art. My Name is Red is mostly about Black, his melancholy force befitting the setting sun of arts in the late 16th century at the time of Murad III. It is a mystery murder, whereas the bigger dilemma is an art, on whom thousands of masters have spent their whole lives, embellishing and going blind, is coming to an end.. It also deals with the themes of art and relegious fundamentalism of Islam and how an artist fights his inner devils.. Shekure was a nice and light side of a picture for me, I can call her a Boss Lady.. And the one I loved was Esther, though a meander character but nonetheless she was Sherlock of her own time..

Sometimes the characters got a bit annoying, namely Shekure. She got on my nerves with her wishy-washy indecisiveness, so much so that I wished I could be inside the book and shake some sense into her.

21147300,Bill Purkayastha,"The scene: The Italian Alps.. The year: 1327.. The background: It’s the late medieval period. The Crusades are over, the Holy Land lost beyond recovery. There are no external enemies to fight. Christianity is now divided against itself, between Pope and Emperor, the secular and the ecclesiastical, heresy and logic, the old and the new.. The plot: Someone is killing the inmates of a remote Benedictine monastery in bizarre ways, and the monks take this as a sign of the Devil at work and of the approaching Apocalypse. Enter the narrator, a novice Benedictine called Adso of Melk, and his mentor, an English Franciscan monk by the name of William of Baskerville. They are there to attend a theological conference, but William, who has experience as an investigator, is charged by the Abbot to look into the murders, not just to find the truth but if necessary to cover it up for the “greater good” of the Church – for if it is the Devil at work, he is to be countered, but if it is a monk who is to blame, William should be careful that the ordinary people – the “sheep” – do not grow to distrust all their “shepherds”.. As more bodies turn up, William is confronted with the mystery of symbols and contexts, and how the past influences the present. When an inquisitor arrives to carry out his own hunt for heretics, Satanists and witches, William’s position becomes more difficult still, but he is still determined to get to the bottom of the mystery.. The scene: Istanbul, Turkey.. The year: 1591.. The background: The Turkish Empire is caught between two forces. On the east is the Persian Safavid Empire. On the west are the Venetians and the other “Franks” – the Europeans, who are well into the Renaissance and whose military prowess is far less important than their flowering of modern thought and culture. Turkey can no longer stay insulated from foreign ideas and ideals, and this arouses resistance – as always – from various quarters, and for different and often conflicting reasons.. The plot: One of the Sultan’s master miniaturists is murdered and his body thrown into a well. The man was one of a small and highly select group of painters and gilders entrusted by the Sultan with a secret commission: to create a book of illustrations in the “modern” European style instead of the traditional Afghan and Persian style rigidly adhered to by the miniaturists of the Muslim world of the time. The European style is thought to be bordering on the blasphemous by both the traditional miniaturists and the mullahs of the mosques, for different reasons, and the killing of the master gilder, Elegant Effendi, could be an attempt to stop the book from being created – or could it?. Enter Black, once an apprentice painter, who went into self-exile for twelve years after falling in love with his maternal uncle’s daughter. Now, the maternal uncle has called him back to Istanbul to help him complete the book, and Shekure, the cousin he was in love with, has a husband presumed dead in the wars and is living with her father with her two sons.. When the killer strikes again, Shekure tells Black he can have her if he finds the killer and takes care of her and her two children. And meanwhile, the Sultan’s officers suspect Black himself of being involved in the killings.. The first of these books is The Name Of The Rose, by the Italian academic and novelist Umberto Eco (please note that I am talking about the book, not about the film, which many more people are familiar with). The second is My Name Is Red, by Turkish Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk. Written a couple of decades apart by different authors living in different countries, it’s still extremely usual to read of one compared to the other, specifically Red to Rose, as though the two were in competition.. I’ve read both these books, and I believe that though they can be read, and enjoyed, individually, they form two parts of a diptych; one compliments and buttresses the other. In this article I’ll try and discuss how.. The first piece of similarity is the fact that they are both putative detective stories, where the detection part doesn’t really matter in itself. To put it differently, neither is an Agatha Christie style murder mystery where everything hinges on the final revelation and the identity of the killer. In both these books, the identity of the murderer is almost incidental, and the detective story is only a hook on which to hang the rest of the novel.. Both these novels are historical novels, and historical novels in a dual sense. Not only are they set in the fairly remote past, but they are both all about history – how the past influences (their) present, and how it is essential to interpret the past in order to understand what is happening around the characters.. In both novels the real battle is essentially one of ideas – the new flooding in and being desperately resisted by the old. In The Name Of The Rose it is the flowering of logical thought that led to the Renaissance, which is so bitterly resisted by the entrenched Church which had so much at stake in keeping the masses poor, ignorant, and afraid. A relatively minor character in terms of the number of pages he occupies, the inquisitor Bernard Gui (a genuinely nasty piece of work who actually existed and was responsible for burning upwards of forty people at the stake) is the embodiment of this reaction. All Bernard wants is heretics to burn; he cares for nothing else, as though destroying free thought and other kinds of “heresy” can hold back the flood of modernity. He will bully and browbeat his suspects into admitting their guilt, twisting their words so that they can say nothing that does not incriminate them. And that is why he is a successful inquisitor.. In My Name Is Red, the conflict of ideas takes the form, not of faith versus heresy, but of schools of painting. Medieval Islamic art was extremely stylised. It invariably showed the world, not as it actually was, but as “Allah” might see it from the top of a minaret, without any attempt at perspective or realism. Realism, in fact, was specifically discouraged, because that introduced the “personal element” of the artist’s vision. Since only Allah was perfect, only what Allah might see could be perfect and the artist tried to depict what he thought Allah would perceive of any given scene. And so the painting style became not just stylised but repetitive, with miniaturists striving to paint exactly as the old master miniaturists of such cities as Herat had done. And, in fact, this is the key to the killer – for the only clue to his identity is the fact that he has painted a realistic horse, not an ideal one, and therefore has a personal “style”.. Meanwhile, the realism of European style painting, with portraits which actually depicted people as they looked, and the world as it looked to a human being, was working its way into the Turkish consciousness, and no less a person than the Sultan himself had decided that he wanted his portrait painted in this style. The reactionaries fell into two camps – one, the traditional miniaturists, personified by Master Osman, the head of the artist’s workshop, who would rather go blind than paint in the European style; and the other the mullahs, who were opposed to all painting as being forbidden by the Koran, and blamed all the ills of the Empire on society’s moving away from Islam.. As with Bernard Gui in the Italian Alps, Pamuk’s book has an ecclesiastical opponent of all things modern, though he never personally makes an appearance. He is a cleric from Erzurum, one Nusret Hoja, who has by the end of the book gathered together a little private army of his own and is determined to force his vision of Islamic rectitude on society, by destroying coffee houses and dervish lodges. He’s a very Mullah Omar kind of figure, whom it is lethally dangerous to mock, as a storyteller who makes repeated appearances throughout the book discovers.. Another similarity is that by modern standards the motives of the two killers is laughable. But the situations of these two books aren’t modern, and the killers aren’t modern people. To them, in the darkness of their little medieval minds, their own purposes were perfectly logical, important and legitimate, no matter how insignificant they would seem to us from the standpoint of the 21st century. One wonders how our motives will be regarded by our descendants six or seven hundred years from now. Not very flatteringly, one feels.. There are many differences between the books, of course, and it’s possible to allude to only a few here; but the similarities in themes and ideas are far more important than the differences.. Taken as a detective story, pure and simple, there’s no comparison: The Name Of The Rose stands head and shoulders above My Name Is Red. Its detective, William of Baskerville, is an open tribute to Sherlock Holmes even to his name (taken from The Hound Of The Baskervilles), with Adso of Melk as a serviceable Watson. In his very first appearance, he makes a very Holmesesque deduction about the whereabouts, name and even the appearance of a runaway horse he has never seen before. He is methodical, knowledgeable, and fact-oriented, rejecting the then-standard belief that the Devil was behind all the evil of the world. William prefers a much more immediate malefactor. William’s motive is the search for truth.. In comparison, Black of My Name Is Red is only a reluctant detective, whose real motive is only to marry and then to sleep with Shekure, and it is only because she orders him to find the killer that he takes the task on himself. This burden takes on added urgency when the Sultan’s officials give him three days to track down the killer, or he and the miniaturists involved in the making of the Sultan’s book will all be put to the torture. And his deductive skills are anything but logical; he depends on serendipity and the aid of Osman in his detective endeavours, and is constantly distracted by Shekure and his own rejection by her children, not to speak of the fear of the torturers.. Then there’s the question of writing style. The Name Of The Rose is linear; told by Adso of Melk, everything that happens is narrated by him directly or as a matter of his knowledge. He thinks as a fourteenth-century monk might think, without a trace of liberalism, except that which has rubbed off on him from William. His characters come across as props for his account; he scarcely even bothers to describe most of them (except William himself), because, to paraphrase him, “What’s the point now? They’re all long dead anyway.” His account has long digressions into history, ecclesiastical expostulation, and symbolism, where the human element is entirely removed. It reads, as it is meant to, as a treatise more than a novel for much of its length.. My Name Is Red is anything but linear. Each chapter is told in a different voice, not just those of the main characters but of dogs and such, even of such intangibles as corpses, the Devil, and the colour red. Over and over, the same ideas and episodes are re-examined from different viewpoints and perspectives, almost as in the film Rashomon. Unlike Rose, Red’s characters are infinitely better drawn, which is rather natural when one looks at the personal voice in which the book is presented. And again unlike Rose, which has a grand total of one female character, who is not even allowed the dignity of a name, Red’s best drawn characters are women: there is Shekure herself, desperate for security for herself and her children, unsure of Black’s love for her, and dreading the brother of her late husband while at the same time retaining affection for him. There is Hayriye, her scheming slave girl, who hates her so much that she sleeps with Shekure's father, Black's uncle, as an act of revenge. There is Esther, the Jewish clothes peddler and itinerant matchmaker, who acts as a double and triple agent as she carries around messages between Shekure, Black, and Shekure’s brother-in-law Hasan. There is even the mythical character Shirin, who appears over and over again in paintings throughout the book, to the extent where she is almost a character herself.. Since these two books are allegedly detective stories, it would be unfair to completely ignore the killers, who are also very different, though, as I’ve said, their motives are equally nonsensical to a modern mind. My Name Is Red’s killer is actually easily guessable (at least I correctly guessed his identity halfway through the book from the clues liberally provided); his crimes are committed in the heat of passion, and one soon realises that he’s not really a bad man. The Name Of The Rose’s murderer is of a completely different nature, a cold and calculating psychopath who uses his own wits, knowledge and logic in his battle with William of Baskerville. He is a far more impenetrable and frightening figure, and one tracks him down alongside William, discovering the clues as William does (another way this book is Sherlock Holmes-esque rather than the whodunit type).. Both books are often slow-going and are emphatically not for those with short attention spans. Red has dashes of black humour, but humour is (and this turns out to be thematically significant) utterly lacking in Rose. In the end, though, neither book’s message is anything to laugh about – and that message is the same.. Personally, I preferred The Name Of The Rose, but that’s probably due to the fact that I read that book much earlier and because the constant shift of viewpoint in My Name Is Red isn’t suited to my tastes. But that’s only on a personal level – at the level of intellectual discussion, these two books strongly complement each other.. I suggest you read them both.","Feb 08, 2018"
2092969,Miriam,"I think I'm giving this book three stars knowing this guy is a Nobel prizewinner, rather than because I liked this book 3 stars. I more liked the book 2 stars, but I'm afraid.. This book is dumb. First, the narrative structure is repetitive. To have so many different people recounting events means that they repeat themselves. It would be one thing if they actually had different voices or unique points of view, but really all they do is pick up the story where the last one left off and go on, with some repetition for orientation. Different characters take somewhat different stances on art, but the writing is all the same and they are fundamentally indistinguishable from each other. And they mostly go back and forth over the idea that representation ""in the style of the Frankish masters"" is or is not sacrilegious. They articulate the different sides, but waffle on taking a position. One of the miniaturists had the characteristic that he wants to please everyone else more so than paint for the beauty of painting. But then in several other sections by different miniaturists, they ALL seemed like they wanted to please someone else and get them on their side. So it's not so much a distinguishing characteristic as a trait of miniaturists? Plus, then some of them say one thing out loud and then contradict it in their interior monologue, or change their mind later. The characters say and do things without clear motivation--one says he both wants to see the miniaturists tortured and also doesn't. But why? He never elaborates, just sets up the juxtaposition and goes on. Shekure is in addition another beautiful woman character of his with no depth or clear motivation. And her proclaimed drive to do everything for her children is in contrast to her use of them as pawns in her scheme to get remarried (which I suppose could be read as an attempt to provide for their future), to pit one against the other for her favor, and to hit them when they say things she doesn't like (not talking about discipline here, just things they say that she doesn't want to hear). She wants to sleep with them and snuggle but not have them grow up or have opinions or whatever. And her attitude toward her father's murder sounds traumatizing for them. I suppose a generous reading would say that most people say what they want and what they stand for but DO very different things, but that's more generous than I feel like being. It's just a jumbled mess. A long, slow jumbled mess.. And Pamuk stuck another character named Orhan into this and upended the narrative. Then he says that Orhan wrote the whole thing and not to trust him. That doesn't work with what all came before, and it's a meaningless twist for its own sake. Not good.. Spoiler alert: I kept reading because I wanted to find out who murdered the two people and why. The identity of the murderer mattered very little (as I said, fundamental sameness, hard to care about them as individuals) but the justification did add something to the discussion. Rather than focusing on the question of representation as sacrilege, the murderer insisted that the gilder wanted to undermine the workshop itself with his conservative views while the head of the project wanted glory for himself by courting the controversy itself. That's a twist.. I guess the themes of representation in art didn't resonate with me. I did enjoy reading the perspective of Istanbul artists about European ones, to think about the changes in art that accompanied the trade, wars, and cultural contact of the sixteenth century. How that would feel to have questions of perspective and artistic intent questioned in some very fundamental ways (what is the difference between the ideal horse as Allah sees it and the horse an artist is capable of drawing and the horse represented as a real horse, distinguishable from other horses?). The curiosity about other styles, the questioning about what an adoption of other styles would mean, the acknowledgement that even without European influence that different workshops evolve their own styles either as a group or a collection of individuals, the difference between the ""old masters"" and the later versions of other artists influenced by their own ideas, imperfections, varying talents. I think I'd rather read this story as nonfiction, with plates and plates of examples of the evolution of styles and the influence of various cultures (Persian, Chinese, Venetian) on miniature paintings, and some primary sources to explain the competing, conflicting views on art. This book is not that book.","Jun 08, 2019"
7908898,Paul,"A whodunnit, written in a kaleidoscope of voices, including the murderer and starting with the murdered, My Name is Red is a book about snow. I mean, it seems to snow all the time, snow is everywhere, sometimes several times in the same paragraph. Aside from the snow, it’s confusing to start with. In fact, as I reached chapter 9, I realised that Chapters 1 and 2 were completely different people, so that reset my points and pinged me off down slightly different tracks. So I read them again and then continued, oh Pamuk, you can’t outwit me that easily. Well I mean you did. but I get there eventually.. Elegant Effendi has been murdered! I know this because he tells me in the first chapter and he’s quite annoyed and upset about it, and he really doesn’t like his murderer, or the fact that no one know’s he’s been murdered, because he’s at the bottom of a well. A couple of chapters later the murderer is talking to me, but who is it? Black is called in to try and find out what happened to Elegant by his uncle, and as he investigates the world of Istanbul’s world of miniaturists, we are presented the story through the eyes of the people he interacts with as well as himself.. It’s all a bit complicated you see. Black’s uncle, also the father to the beautiful, capricious Shekure, who everyone in the world thinks is beautiful, has been commissioned by the Sultan to create a magnificent book, in the style of the damned Franks. This goes against everything that the miniaturists, the holy men and everyone in between believe in, as well as a tradition stretching back generations. But as in all times, a few coins slipped here and there, some men’s souls do not shine so bright as the luminous reflection of a few gold or silver pieces, the book is slowly put together, without anyone but Black’s uncle seeing the whole thing. What doesn’t help poor Black is that rumours are going around surrounding this book, and a zealous preacher is inciting hatred against everything that is not traditional (now that sounds vaguely familiar). It’s not all inkwells and innuendo about artist’s quill’s though. There’s a love interest. Black is in love (as is the murderer) with Shekure. She has moved back into her uncles following advances made by her missing husbands brother but she cannot hide forever, and her two young children need a dad, is Black man enough? While navigating a murder investigation, Black and Shekure court each other through the seller of wares and local cupid Esther, one of the books more engaging characters.. Pamuk uses a highly original style in My Name Is Red that means you have to think while you read, and being a man, meaning I can’t multitask, it takes a while to get used to, but never the less, it is still hugely enjoyable. The city, it’s people, their habits, their daily chores and errands, their food are all here, observed and followed by the characters as they narrate their way around their work and the murder that has engaged even the Sultan himself.. Not just a captivating murder mystery (a genre I have zero interest in, while I was intrigued about who the murderer was, I did not work it out until roughly the same time as Black) My Name Is Red is also an intricate look at the world of miniaturist painting in Istanbul, and across the Islamic world, it’s great proponents and place in the scheme of the religion and the more earthly rulers. While each of the subjects tell us how they are the best of their time, some rail against the Frankish methods, using perspective, painting portraits, that take painting away from how God sees the world, to how people see it, ultimately making people the centre piece of art, and not God himself. Yet still there is the recognition that everything they have achieved, everything they have striven for and created will be swept away by this new style from the West, a recognition and often fear that resonates particularly loudly today.. I’ve read Pamuk’s Istanbul, which I loved, even if I thought Pamuk himself came across as a little weird, eccentric, let’s go with eccentric. But I loved his prose, his view of the world, and I wanted to read more of his fiction after A Strangeness in my Mind which I also loved. Now, I think I’ll wrap up against the snow, and read another.. (blog review. here. )","Jul 02, 2018"
5456705,Mindy McAdams,"I could muster no enthusiasm for this book or the story it tells. It is at least twice as long as needed to tell the tale it encompasses, and as for the so-called mystery — the reader needs to care about something if a mystery is to be of interest, and there was just nothing to care about here. The dead man seems to have no personality at all, and that is true for all of the various potential suspects as well. It's not lost on me that maybe that blandness was a deliberate move on the author's part, because a central theme here is the absence of individualistic characteristics in the traditional form of painting in the Ottoman empire in the 1500s.. This Ottoman style of painting was inherited or adopted from the Persians, and the miniaturists in Istanbul in this story still revere those ancestors — but this is the era of western ascendancy, and some of these Istanbul painters have seen the new painting style from Europe. Renaissance painting features not only linear perspective but also distinctive individual styles, such that you can recognize who made a painting. This theme — the recognizability of style, and the ascendance of individualism over collectivism — is at the core of the story.. Unfortunately, it is repeated over and over and beaten to a pulp until I, as a reader, wanted to scream. Pamuk is far too good a writer to have dedicated time to such a draggy, dull tale.. The most interesting parts of the book, for me, were those told by two women — who are not even involved in the painting work, because of course women would never have been allowed to make art. Chapters are narrated in the first person by all the different characters. Esther (a Jewish peddler) and Shekure (a beautiful young widow with two children) were the most three-dimensional people in the story. However, their roles are really peripheral.. There was lots of potential here, but it's drowned in detail and redundancy. In particular, I liked the thread about the religious fanatics who are trying to destroy figurative painting altogether just now that it teeters on the edge of becoming individualistic. The painters talk about representing the world as God sees it, not as humans see it. They talk about transferring to their images God's vision of the world, and there's a mystical element beyond mere talent. (I am fascinated by Sufi dervishes and really enjoyed the mentions of them in this story.) This enables the miniaturists to defend their painting of human figures, even though the Quran explicitly forbids it.. I also think this book might have suffered from the translation. The language is rather wooden and dull. In. The Black Book. by the same author — which I loved and want to read again — the language was rich and tantalizing, lovely, lush. I fear that maybe the translator of. My Name Is Red. was not up to the task.","Apr 27, 2017"
39829724,جلجامش Nabeel,"It is an amazing novel; a mix of historical fiction, romance, and mystery. I enjoyed reading it discovering the life style, beliefs, art, and politics in the 16th century. The main issue the novel discusses is the conflict between west and east – as in all Pamuk’s novels – but here art is their battlefield. It showed me important things about the characteristic of western culture, which is individuality, something not recognized in the east. Even oriental miniaturists were not allowed to have their own style, and to follow the style of their old masters; this might indicate the oriental will to keep the traditions untouched. On contrary, in the west each innovation of creativity was welcomed and encouraged. The other thing is the conflict between religion and art in Islam, something so related to this era witnessing the rise of radical Islam and iconoclast, as the novel talks about a radical clergyman from Erzurum whose followers were accused of being behind the assassinations of miniaturists, and attacking coffee shops, and dervishes’ lodges. The novel gives us a glimpse on the Safavid-Ottoman wars in that period, the strong beliefs in Jinn, and mysterious things; Pamuk was so brilliant depicting the life of past in details. I loved knowing more about Persian and Ottoman art and poetry and many writers from the orient that I have never read for them before. This story was a way to discover new things on this region. I read on Ibn Shakir, a miniaturist from Baghdad who left the city after its sack by the Mongols. To this Baghdadi miniaturist the oriental style is attributed, after he drew the city from the top of minaret during the savage destruction by Hulagu Khan. The novel shows the conflict between those who want to follow the European styles, and those who want to preserve the past, and those who are against art and depiction figures. The mystery increases when we discover that the killer was not but the same brilliant miniaturist who drew the portrait of the Sultan in Frankish style. He committed his first crime to save his colleagues and their workshop as his victim was convinced that the book they were working on was to violate their religion, and was spreading those rumors. The second crime was because the workshop’s master Enishte insulted him, and insulted Master Osman when he forced them to mimic the works of Franks. So the crime was to save the workshop, and its style in both cases. The Persian miniaturists Olive felt that he will never attain the European talent, and that they need centuries to mimic their own excellence and this would make Ottomans the slaves of Europe. Thus, we read in the last chapters, after discovering the killer’s identity, “Precisely because you emulate the Franks, you will never attain individual style.”. In this story too, we read how homosexuality was something so frequent in the Orient, and the Ottoman empire, how Jews were facing discrimination despite being welcomed in Istanbul after their exile from Spain and Portugal. In the story, Esther, the Jewess street paddler, depicted in a stereotype of a person who is working for all and against all. She was forced to wear pink outfit, and fake stories on killing Christian children to be used for Jewish religions festivals was mentioned too. Slavery was mentioned too, and its market in Bayazid district. The novel is full of amazing descriptions of manuscripts in details, as well as lots of stories and legends on old master miniaturists, love stories of Shahs and Kings, and an Assyrian fable on death.. The philosophical discussions on death, art, devil, blindness, and life are so frequent too. The jealous brother, and the beloved mother is a common feature as well; this reminds us of Pamuk’s own experience. Describing the city in details, its weather, rain, snow, cypresses and buildings is one of Pamuk’s genuine styles.. I hate how people in those periods were looking to people from other religions; the word “infidel” was annoyingly frequent in the novel whenever describing Europeans. The Muslim preachers were even against showing tolerance to other religions and sects. Still, I enjoyed this novel too much, and until now I am unable to know whether Orhan Pamuk is with preserving the Ottoman Heritage or abandoning it; something so frequent in all his works. I think he himself is not able to decide and this might be his most pressing issue to discover and discuss.. Quotes:. Before my birth there was infinite time, and after my death, inexhaustible time. I never thought of it before: I had been living luminously between two eternities of darkness.. A face long not seen finally fades.. Dogs do speak, but only to those who know how to listen.. Painting is the silence of thought and the music of sight.. Immediately before the end of the world, there would also be such silence.. Those who can truly see, know.. Does love make one a fool or do only fools fall in love?. The larger and more colorful a city is, the more places there are to hide one’s guilt and sin; the more crowded it is, the more people there are to hide behind. A city’s intellect ought to be measured not by its scholars, libraries, miniaturists, calligraphers, and schools, but by the number of crimes insidiously committed on its dark streets over thousands of years. By this logic, doubtless, Istanbul is the world’s most intelligent city.. Only wealth, might, and legendary romances stir people’s curiosity. Everything else is but worry, separation, jealousy, loneliness, enmity, tears, gossip, and never-ending poverty.. The love all khans, shahs, and sultans feel for paintings, illustrations and fine books can be divided into three seasons; at first, they are bold, eager and curious. Rulers want paintings for the sake of respect, to influence how others see them. During this period, they educate themselves. During the second phase, they commission books to satisfy their own tastes. Because they have learned sincerely to enjoy paintings, they amass prestige while at the same time amassing books, which, after their deaths, ensure the persistence of their renown in this world. However, in the autumn of a sultan’s life, he no longer concerns himself with the persistence of his worldly immortality.. The birth of a new style is the result of years of disagreements, jealousies, rivalries, and studies in color and painting.. Indifference, time, and disaster will destroy our art.. Color is the touch of the eye, music to the deaf, a word out of darkness.. For men like myself, that is, melancholy men for whom love, agony, happiness, and misery are just excuses for maintaining eternal loneliness, life offers neither great joy nor great sadness.. Contrary to what is commonly believed, all murderers are men of extreme faith rather than unbelievers.. The beauty and mystery of this world only emerges through affection, attention, interaction and compassion.. Time does not flow if you do not dream.","Oct 11, 2015"
7486808,Anusha Jayaram,"I first picked this book up several years ago. I remember finding the narrative style odd, and the subject itself abstract and unintelligible. It was one of the very few books I stopped reading in the middle, simply because I realized I was getting nowhere with it. I decided, on a whim, to give it another try when I stumbled upon it again so many years later. And I'm glad I did.. I've realized yet again, that what a book means to you depends so much on who you are when you read the book. But I digress. Getting back to the book itself now... Turkey is one of the most fascinating places on earth - a multi-layered tapestry possessed of a rich and complex history, and a culture shaped by several different influences. A large part of this is owed to its geographic location. Situated at the point where East meets West, Turkey has long served as a gateway, and as a melting pot of cultures. Equally, it has also struggled constantly, existentially, to define its own identity, shape its own character.. Istanbul is quite literally a microcosm of all these forces, straddling the Bosphorus strait, belonging to both Europe and Asia at the same time.. It is this setting, this underlying generic theme that is necessary to relate to, as a reader, in order to fully immerse oneself in this book. Set in the late 16th century, the story takes us through the lives of master miniature painters in the workshop of the Ottoman Sultan Murat III. The plot itself deals with the murder of one of the master miniaturists, and unfolds through the eyes of multiple characters.. Pamuk uses this narrative device well - each chapter is narrated by a different individual, in their own voice, complete with their own self-interests in view. Pamuk does not repeat the same incidents through the eyes of multiple characters in Rashomon-esque style (which can be fascinating in its ability to toy with the reader's understanding of the 'absolute truth', by presenting multiple twists to the events that have transpired), instead choosing to move the story along at a faster pace. The chronology is linear, with each narrator picking up where the previous individual left off.. We do get to see plenty of manipulation in action, characters being wary of one another, sometimes with cause, sometimes without. What is also interesting is that each of the narrators pulls the reader into the story, addressing him / her directly, trying to ingratiate themselves with the reader. This could be due to the fact that this is a translated work from Turkic (although I may be wrong on this front), nevertheless this adds an interesting flavour to the book - knowing that characters are self-conscious, editing facts and events to portray themselves in a better light for the sake of the reader.. Another aspect of the multiple-narrator format that I found interesting is that, once in a while, there were unconventional characters picking up the thread of the story: a sketch of a horse, a tree, the devil, and red ink, among others.. As I read through each chapter, I couldn't help but look for 'clues' to who the murderer would turn out to be, sometimes revisiting previous chapters to corroborate or contradict events. But gradually, the question of who the murderer really was receded in its importance. I began to get absorbed in the lengthy monologues and debates between the characters, the philosophical and religious angst they struggled with. At their core, these debates are universal in theme and remain as relevant today as they were in 16th centiry Istanbul: human nature and ego, the struggle between individualism and the obligation to conform, and the various shades of interpretation and elasticity concerning any religious doctrine (and also the use of these 'rules' opportunistically, for personal benefit).. As for the characters themselves, they are so flawed, so real and compelling, that one is able to relate to them, even when they behave seemingly irrationally. Particularly interesting is the portrait (intentional use of the term here) of Shekure, in all her greyness. She proves herself to be an artful manipulator, seeking to maximize her benefit no matter the cost to others, while at at the same time remaining vulnerable in her unfortunate situation. Even after finishing the book, I couldn't quite make up my mind about how I felt about her!. Of course, there are some prerequisites to enjoying the book.. Perhaps the most important is that it would help immensely to have a broad understanding of the history and geography of all the places mentioned in the book prior to reading it. Part of this was accomplished by helpfully providing a map at the beginning of the book. I remember thinking several times while reading the book that I should brush up my history to understand some references better. After completing the book, however, I found a skeletal 'Chronology' of rulers and events at the back of the book. It would have been perfect if that had been transposed next to the map, right at the beginning of the book.. On a slightly less important note, the reader has to quickly get over the initial shock of seemingly accepted cultural norms of the time: master artists chasing after young and pretty boys, and describing their almond eyes and full red lips. Once the reader has sunk into that society, becoming a part of it, these references will seem less jarring.. Another aspect that I needed to get used to was the seemingly never-ending detail, once Pamuk launched into any description of book arts. It is as if he had opened an inexhaustible fount of masterpiece-names, and that he could not stop listing them out. The unending lists were difficult to focus on. Those, and the repetition of the tale of Shirin and Husrev scores of times throughout the book.. But it is ungrateful to enjoy a book so very much and dwell too much on its flaws, so I will stop with this here :). By the time the book concluded, I found myself not too concerned with the identity of the murderer, since the book had so much else to offer. I realized the revelation of the murderer didn't shock or excite me, as, perhaps it was never meant to. What I did enjoy is the last few lines by Shekure.. *Spoiler alert*. When Shekure reveals that she had shared all her letters with her son, Orhan, and that he is the narrator of this story, the reader realizes that Orhan's own biases would have been an inseparable part of the narration, adding another layer to the already colourful story.. *End of Spoiler*. There is also a piece of trivia that I came across after finishing the book, that I found very endearing: in the book, Shekure's younger son's name is Orhan. And the older son's name is Shevket. This also happens to be the name of Orhan Pamuk's elder brother in real life. That just made me smile.","Dec 26, 2016"
49498312,Philippa,"3.5 stars. I’ve never both liked and disliked a book so much at the same time.. The theme of art and illustration and how it was seen at the time of the novel was fascinating. Imagine what it must be like having never seen ‘life-like’ art or portraits! And imagine the philosophical and theological questions that a change in centuries long traditions of art would evoke. The characters are plagued by these questions and we see them with the context they have to the characters lives - which is a truly novel, inspiring way to tell this story. I’m in awe.. But at the same time, my god, some chapters were painfully boring. The repetition of thoughts we’ve already heard from other characters and the half page descriptions of the scene (which often read like a list) became tedious. I wonder if this was a reflection of the theme around illustrating objects to accompany a narrative? Either way I struggled to get through some parts.. The murder investigation plot of the story didn’t really engage me at all. I wasn’t particularly interested in finding out who the murder was and their reasons for doing it. I found the murderer suspects dialogue some of the least enjoyable chapters to read and was often confused about how I was supposed to feel towards them.. My favorite character by far was the shrewd and endearing Shekure. I very much enjoyed the portrayal of the challenges of womanhood in Istanbul in the 16th century through her and also Esther, the clothier.. I’m not sure if there is supposed to be criticism of Islam in this novel. It appears that way at times when some chapters seen sarcastic, but I need to read more about Orhan Pamuk and his outlook.. I’m left with lots of questions but I can’t bring myself to go back and read through this again. It’s probably my loss - but jeez some this felt like a tome of a book!","Nov 04, 2018"
79416586,Florina Mocanu,"If you want to travel to some times not many know of, then reading 'My Name is Red' must be a priority.. Telling you about this book will not be easy, as this is an enormous literary work with so many characters and with a story that transcends its pages.. The main characters in the novel are the miniaturists in the Ottoman Empire: Black, Butterfly, Stork, Olive and Elegant. The book begins with the murder of the later. From this point we begin the story of the Westernization of the Ottoman pictorial art and how the artists either embrace it or they fought against it.. Each chapter of the novel has a different narrator, although the story is progressing naturally. Not only people are narrating, but also a coin, a corpse, Satan, two dervishes and even the color red. The novel touches not only on the Istanbul's history but also on the romance between Black and Shekure, between Butterfly and Olive and it also touches on the role of the woman in this period.. Enishte Effendi, the maternal uncle of Black and Shekure's father, is one of the supporters of the Western art and he tricks his disciples into creating nontraditional miniatures. Half way though, however someone murders him too. At this point, Pamuk is explaining how the Ottoman artists were supposed to render what God wanted them to and their passion and willingness to show us, the mortals, was frowned upon. Black is the one explaining it the best: 'Pictures are forbidden by our faith. Because the illustrations of the Persian masters and even the masterpieces of the greatest masters of Herat are ultimately seen as an extension of border ornamentation, no one would take issue with them, reasoning that they enhanced the beauty of writing and the magnificence of calligraphy.'. However, no matter how much one fights change in the end people will always want it.","May 05, 2020"
8435595,Jamie,"Though I'm still untangling all the intertextual references, I enjoyed the mix of voices in this novel. The whole mystery premise and the obvious amount of attention paid to history, the arts, and belief leads me to compare it to Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose in some respects. The opening chapter in which the corpse of the murdered man speaks directly to the reader was a great hook and entry into an increasingly intricate story. I think the mix of voices is what really makes the work unique, especially when all kinds of inanimate things begin to speak more directly on the philosophies and tensions that guide the characters and as someone not an expert on Turkish art or history, a good place to start looking up or be introduced to some key traits of Turkish culture (there's a lot about art styles that come to Istanbul from around the world) and the stories that are referenced repeatedly throughout. Though you have to be ready to really sit with this novel as it's over 400 pages long and it can take a moment to remember who is speaking as everything is in first person and rather philosophical, it never really struck me as inaccessible. I didn't sit with Wikipedia or any other resource on Turkey or art next to me while I read, though I did flag and takes notes a lot expecting to review all I'd read when I finished. All in all, a very thought provoking book about art and Istanbul's place between east and west. Recommended, especially to those more philosophically inclined as I wouldn't necessarily call it light reading (but I'm sure if you're just in it for the romance and murder mystery aspects, you'll still find something enjoyable in trying to decide which voice belongs to a murderer).","May 18, 2018"
11772351,David Kent,"An extraordinarily complex narrative revolving around the murder of an illuminator, one of several artists who have been hard at work illuminating (illustrating) the Sultan's new book, a book that perhaps isn't what the Sultan expects. Orhan Pamuk is a Turkish writer who later won the Nobel Prize in Literature.. The book begins with a chapter called ""I am a corpse,"" written from the point of view of a man who has just been murdered. All the chapters are written from the points of view of the individual characters. ""I am called Black"" introduces Black, returning from a 12-year exile to woo his long-lost love. ""I, Shekure,"" that long-lost love, is however waiting for her husband to return from the wars, knowing inside he is likely dead. Her two children, one of whom is named Orhan, which plays into the story at the end, have ambiguous feelings for Black. Then there is Hasan, the husband's brother, himself in love with the beautiful Shekure. Add in repeating chapters ""I am called...Butterfly/Stork/Olive,"" the nicknames given by ""Master Osman"" to the three remaining illuminators, one of whom is likely the murderer. Since the illuminations themselves take on an important role, there are chapters from their points of view in ""I am a...a Dog/a Tree/a Gold Coin/a Horse."" And let's not forget ""I am Esther,"" a clothier-slash-matchmaker delivering messages between the star-crossed lovers.. All of this overlays incredible insights into Muslim culture, history, and views on art. Should the illuminations represent the viewpoint of God, or of the artists originality; a tension that drives much of the narrative beyond whether Shekure and Black will ever be together. These insights raise the book from merely a story to an epic exploration of a culture that very few Americans are familiar.","Jul 31, 2018"
3084169,Ali علی ,"This book reminded me of Tolstoy's War and Peace which may sound ludicrous to some, but here are some reasons why:. * both books are historical fictions based on actual historical events.. * both authors have done lots of background hitorical research for the novels, even though Pamuk's book is based on much distant era, and hence his efforts are more impressive in this regard.. * Tolstoy's book weaves the narrative with recurring reflections on history, philosophy of history etc., In Pamuk's account reflections on history are replaced by reflections on the nature of painting and art.. * both books deal with the issue of religion, modernity etc.. * In both books actual stories are not complex, nor are reflections, even though Pamuk's poetic prose is able to avoid monotony. It does help that Pamuk's book is much shorter. Also, the complexity of Pamuk's narrating style to a large extent compensates for the simplicity of the story.. Translation is excellent ( and I can say this even without ever reading the original). The only major problem I had was the term 'sect' , as in Shafi sect, which doesn't make sense, because Shafi is a legal school of thought and not a sect by any standards. I'm not sure what was the original term used, but regardless this is a misleading rendition. More minor problem was with using Turkish rendition of non Turkish names, for e.g. Husro for Khusro.. Note: I'm fairly at home with the cultural, historical and literary references and background of the story so I'm not sure how someone without the background will like the book.","Sep 18, 2020"
4072019,Namita Jagannath,"​'What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.'. Orhan delivers again! I love the writing, the choice of words, the characters, the detailing...it's almost as if you're watching a movie. He surely knows how to paint a picture. I marvel at how good the original must be, if the translation is such a lovely rendition. I generally do not enjoy a novel with too many narrators​; ​but this one I did. Every chapter, title, sentence and thought is so well thought through...almost perfect! If there is anything called 'perfect.' The book deals so beautifully with its complex themes - love, murder, influence of art and religion, etc. Very few authors have the ability wherein you read a sentence, or a thought and you want to stop - let it sink in and you marvel at the magic of words.. But in all honesty, in my opinion there are points in the book wherein some chapters wander off into too much detail about the Ottoman Empire and the ​​miniaturist art and its influences in the 16th century. Other than this, I ideally want one and all to read this. Such is my joy with this book, that I want all my reader friends to enjoy it as well. People looking for a page-turner/thriller should stay away. People looking for good literature - hurry! This is a good read and one for the shelf as well.","Apr 15, 2018"
22218283,Sonal,"I so much wanted to like this book. When I started it, I was so excited. Historical fiction on the Ottoman empire with a murder mystery, a love affair, art and artists in the galore. It was supposed to be a feast. But this one was definitely not for me. It was tedious, I dragged through the pages and literally had to put in an effort to finish it off.. I understand why this book is a classic and I did learn quite a lot about the traditional illustrative Islamic arts. Islam forbids idol-worshipping, so portraits and true representation of the living is considered heresy. But an artist after his travel to Venice and beholding European representative art, get inspired to illustrate his Sultan true to his likeness. Although commissioned by the Sultan himself, this doesn't go well with the old thinkers.. The premise is actually interesting but the story is not even one-fourth of the book. Rest is the ramblings of the artists and description of several illustrations and respective short stories, with no relation to the actual plot. I being unfamiliar with the Turkish folklore, these folk tales are not always complete and since unrelated it kind of gets distracting after a point. I started looking for bits and pieces of the main story between the pages. I was there for the story and not philosophy, maybe that is why I didn't really enjoy it like the others.","Jul 19, 2020"

56337123,Georgina Kelly,"what an superb book. set in the late 17th century Ottoman Empire this is a book of sultans and shas, believers and infidels, folklore and fables among the years of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. as influences from Western provinces (such as Venice grow and spread throughout the Islamic world conflicts around meaning in the visual arts are the context for the love/crime story in the foreground. But it is by far the clash of philosophies around what is fit and not fit to be represented, what does and does not violate the singularity that is Allah, the loss of one world to another that absorbed me utterly. The grief of those either struggling to protect the practices of the old Turkish masters whose work complied with religious strictures, those who were attracted to the Western ""stuyle"" which involved the individual ego and was often considered idolatrous, and then the eventual fall of the visual art world completely as Islam became more rigid and illustration fell out of favour entirely. the language is luscious and the format innovative. we hear the voices of a picture of a tree, the colour red, the spectre of death, as well as all the characters involved in the novel. this novel could also have been called ""my name is perspective"" and is an examination of the many angles of perspective both literally and figuratively. what the eye observes, how the individual mind co-creates the thing ""seen""according to individual and cultural memory and desire. this is a lusciously written novel and rich with ideas. one of my favourite novels this year.","Apr 07, 2018"
27237533,can y,"Yahya Kemal Bayatlı, one of Turkey's most renowned poets, once famously declared that Turks ""would have been a completely different people, had they proper examples of prose and painting"".. Consciously or not, Pamuk's ""My Name is Red"" is a response to Bayatlı. The book is about a murder mystery among miniaturists, masters of Oriental painting. Miniature is an attempt at ""showing the world as God sees it from above the clouds"", and the way Pamuk weaves in the story from multiple perspectives, with an apparently omniscient viewer looking at the story is not much different from what the old masters of miniature were up to. A single linear perspective throughout the prose as is done in the West, is not employed in the book, instead replaced with plurality. Throughout the book, the tension between Western art and Eastern art, builds up to the book Enişte's crafting for the Sultan. As master Osman looks at the book, he identifies the pictures inside as neither Western nor Eastern, but a confused mixture of both (and is this not what Pamuk suggests Turkish society is?).. Had the old masters of miniature written novels in the way they paint, I bet it would look similar to ""My Name is Red."" Masterful.","Jul 23, 2018"
50946522,Shifad,"This is my first Orhan Pamuk and it will take sometime getting used to. The entire background of the story and Turkish culture, folklore and the Heroes were unfamiliar to me. At times I felt I was beleaguered by notions and ideas foreign to me. Needless to say, the initial few pages took me sometime to get used to. There is also a poetic quality in his writing. Eventhough the major plot in the story is a murder, the book also discusses a wide variety of philosphies. The book is told in the view point of different persons and each chapter is different from one another. This book discusses a wide variety of human emotions, many social issues at the time. The whole book is set against the backdrop of miniaturisation and illustration. The impact of western style painting on the eastern way of painting and its conflux is depicted in the story. This book may feel like a drag in the first few pages. This can be attributed to the historical and islamic theological trivia that the author entwines with the plot. Needless to say, this book is a complex piece if literature. It will certainly demand your whole attention or you will get derailed.","Mar 15, 2018"
21047992,Büşra,"Orhan Pamuk is a well known author in my country, so right after Pamuk won the Nobel Prize for Literature I meant to read this book. However I only now had the chance to read this one. I also study Turkish history, so this is a period more than familiar to me. However, I wish I could avoid rating this novel. My Name is Red was such a difficult book to follow. I imagine it is not easily accessible intellectually either. I can also imagine the common reader who has absolutely no knowledge of the 16th century İstanbul thinking “Sir Pamuk, what are you trying to say?”. It has a somehow gripping beginning, then right when you think you are engaged with the story, you get lost in the heavy waves of details he provided on the historical aspects of art. Eventually, it drags on and on and on. The narrative in this book shifts from person to person to objects and back again. It is not easy at all to follow all the shifts. I know it has heavy literary worth, hence the 3 stars, but it just wasn't for me.","Jan 29, 2020"
40993737,Muhammad Arif,"Honestly speaking, I mistook this beautifully written novel for a wholesome journey into Muslim architecture and painting, for it gives us such a unique insight into the nuances of orthodox and modern views of Muslim painters and miniaturists, taking cues from the glorious Quran in the defense of paintings that: “it is indeed important that a painting, through its beauty summon us toward life’s abundance, toward compassion, toward respect for the colors of the realm which God created, and toward reflection and faith. The identity of the miniaturist isn’t important.” Without any doubt, ‘painting and happiness are the genesis of our true world and painting is a wonderful feast for the eyes.’. This book can enhance the warped understanding of Muslims about painting and miniaturists and the beauty and mystery of this world can only be found when they open their eyes wide and actually see this world by attending to its colors and details.","Aug 19, 2020"
35973717,Revanth Ukkalam,"Pamuk's novel is locked in time and fixed in its context: a place where living is mandated by work and work by faith. It is an era of globalisation of art: the Chinese, Indians, Persians, Mongols, and Turks learn freely from each other but the most dreaded are the Venetians with their humanist paintings. It is an age where 'There is no God but God and Muhammad is his prophet'. Elegant Enishte is murdered in that world. The history of Turkey and the crossroads of Asia and Europe have a deep imprint on his death. The novel echoes Firdausi and Nizami. Leyla-Mujnun, and Shirin-Khusrau resonate in the love that Pamuk pens. Orhan Pamuk has inherited the best qualities of post-modernism and historical fiction in writing this.","Feb 20, 2018"
18534820,William Tracy,"This is an incredibly interesting book. Each chapter is from one of many POVs, including a dead man, a painting of a horse, a painting of a tree (!), 7 or 8 characters, and the murderer. The story takes a bit to get going, especially to get all the characters straight. There are connections between them that only come to light later on. The story itself is set in the 16th century Ottoman empire, and is concerned with the murder of a painter (miniaturist) working on a new book for the sultan.. On the downside, I would say the characters are a bit flat, and the main characters (if they can be called that) are not particularly likable. However, I would recommend this simply for the artistry of how it is written, and for the view into a culture we don't usually see in the USA.","Feb 08, 2019"
50990083,Shatha Qaiwer,"My Name is Red. Starting as an author to whom the reader is cognitively attached, to a minor character in the novel and finally stated as the future author to pen the story narrated presently, Pamuk has smartly and elegantly achieved the unity of the event in the real world with the story world taking the reader nicely to the future and back to the present. An additional string of unity is achieved through depicting the color red; red for love, red for lust (master Osman and the miniaturists; Hayriye and Enshite, Hasan and Shekure), red for hate and envy (Young miniaturists, Hayriye and Shekure), red for death (Olive’s doubled character as a killer and a pious person whose action of killing devoted for Allah). This string is connected other representations of the colour narrated by the personified dog, tree, coin, death which starts at the very beginning with corpse covered with blood. Red in the novel signifies the mixture of lust, desire, hatred and jealousy on the negative side and love on the plus side centred on Shekure (Black, her children, Enishte) making her character a nucleus of the events.. Skekure’s character reflects significantly what we can describe as the bright and dark part of Women’s nature. She seeks marriage for living and securing her children, i.e she was seeking security she could not find at her in-laws. Her intentions are sincerely revealed in the plan she arranged to marry Black. She set her condition prior to sharing bed including revealing the identity of her father’s murderer, and completing his book. Listening to her plot, Black admires her beauty which she comprehended as praise for her intelligence which she used to hear her father praising and starts weeping:. ‘As I cried, it was as if I’d left myself and was becoming another, entirely separate woman. Like some reader troubled by a sad picture in the pages of a book, I saw life from the outside and pitied what I saw. There’s something so innocent in crying over one’s troubles, as though they were another’s …’ CH 32. Even during her first intimate contact with Black’s wounded body, she was not too much into it as she commented with the World in her mouth, all that amused her was ‘the twittering of my sons cursing and roughhousing with each other in the courtyard’. In return to her love, Black’s feeling were strongly self- denying ones. Though ware of what she is after, he proceeds in implementing her plan and seeks to be a good father to her children basically for her sake. The way he responds to Shvket’s accusation of killing his Enishte, Black’s reply was not a yes/ no answer instead he thought how that accusation might be upsetting Shekure ‘ if you are going to upset your mother, do not expect any affection from me.’ He cares so much to treat them kindly but when it came to hurting his beloved he proceeded ‘we did not shout at each other like a stepfather and stepson, but like two men talking by the banks of a loud rushing river (Ch 36).. It seems that Pamuk uses his characters to narrate and teach history, a feature I identified in some eastern novels. The text is loaded with historical information which I do not really value as I read novels to learn about life and people but YES my future destination can include other works written by Orhan Pamuk.","Nov 11, 2019"
5539620,Dorum,"I really enjoyed this book.. First of all it is written in a very interesting manner. It keeps one interested and gripped to the story. So from a technical point of view it is quite good.. Also, I like the world it describes. It is exotic. The story makes it interesting, even though it is so remote and different from my common experience.. However, these points, while good for a 3-4 star novel don't make it a 5-star novel. The reason why I believe this is a 5-star novel is because of the gripping and extremely detailed analysis and contrast of aesthetic values in the Orient and in the Occident.. The world of the miniaturists is used only as a pretext to describe how the world East and the West see things like beauty and value in completely different manner. And also why.","Nov 21, 2019"

Some chapters are narrated by unusual characters, such as a dead man, the drawing of a dog, the drawing of a tree, and a coin. One problem I had with the book was that several of the characters were damn irritating without any redeeming features, and they weren't even the antagonists!. And then there was all that damn commentary on the nature of visual art. It seemed so pretentious, so ambiguous, that I have to wonder if this was satire! It seemed so stupid, so empty.

Just like the faces in Persian miniatures, the authors of each chapter are both enmeshed with each other and looking out to the reader as a judge or admirer.

I learned heaps about the influence of Venetian style and perspective on Ottoman art, which really serves as the basis of the entire plot.. But because there was such focus on painting as an art form, I did find it difficult to become wholly invested in the characters themselves, and in doing so, felt as though the tension building in the plot often fell flat. And as interested as I was in all of the philosophy of art, it made the novel a dense read, one I couldn’t just pick up and spend 10 mins with on my morning commute..

It took me around 2 months or more to read this book, but it was worth the time spent. Though it’s a thick book, it never bored me or made me tired, as every chapter was narrated by a different character, reading the same story from different points of view was really interesting to me. Moreover the author surprises you in every couple of chapters by coming up with something brilliant and new; such as an unpredictable event, a new character or revelation of a mystery. In my opinion what makes this book special is the proficiency of the author in characterization, not only main human characters like Black Effendi, Shekure, Eshter, Enishte Effendi and... have their very special and different features but also things! Some chapters are narrated by things like a coin, a painting, or even a color!. I highly recommend “My Name is Red” to those who take joy in reading tales like “One Thousand and One Night”.

1551688,Brian,"Istanbul, 16th century:. ""What could be more exquisite than looking at the world's most beautiful pictures while trying to recollect God's vision of the world?"". A miniaturist is murdered, and from the bottom of a well, his corpse begins the story of My Name is Red. A different narrator in each chapter presents this tale of mystery, romance and pride. There's even a chapter told by a coin, a dog, Satan, a horse, and the color red.. My Name is Red presents a history of 16th Ottoman painting and its position in the Muslim world. With master miniaturists returning from travels to western countries, they brought back with them the visual memory of a controversial style of painting, realism, paintings using shadows and perspective to create a true likeness of a subject. To the faithful, painting in this style is an unpardonable sin. Placing a true likeness of a subject in the center of a page, taking art away from the margins of books, adding perspective that may entail painting other objects, even a dog or Satan, bigger than the Sultan was considered blasphemy. This type of painting veered away from the way God envisioned the world. And by placing a subject in the center of the page gave undue importance to that image potentially creating a vision that fostered idolatry. Only pride and the belief that one was greater than Allah would create such a thing.. Kuala Lumpur, 21st century:. I learned about such things early in my career here. I learned that I could not design a sculpture in the likeness of a human or animal, even in abstract form. But like during the Ottoman period the strict guidelines, the unwavering laws that governed artists, billowed slightly in the western cultural wind allowing interpretations to creep into the rigid artistic belief system. Sculpting insects became permissible.. As I write this I think about how I've completely tuned out the call to prayers from the National Mosque located near my home but recall seeing children cry in fear when walking near the loud speakers billowing sermons near the grocery store. In the papers this week there were articles about how the Syariah High Court now allows a Muslim convert to renounce Islam and go back to their former religion, a landmark ruling; apostasy is still illegal for Muslims born into the faith. A blogger was jailed under the Sedition Act for calling certain officials 'dogs' and 'pigs', a tremendous insult due to the status of these two forbidden animals within the Muslim world. The word 'Allah' has been ruled strictly a Muslim word and no other religion may print it in their publications; the Catholic Church is currently in court over this ruling. And every Sultan, prime minister and minister has a portrait painted of them in the style of the West; a portrait that uses perspective, shadow and color to create a true likeness, a potential idol.. But there's something more about this book that I can't quite put into words. Though the Istanbul painted by Pamuk was mostly bleak. The fears when a believer feels he's dishonored the Great Prophet, the Sultan, or his Master were brush stokes that created an oppressive picture. But the freedom of individual spirit as witnessed in the coffee house carousing and story telling that bordered on the blasphemous and the power of pride that oft times grew stronger than the fear of diminishing faith illustrated the strength and the power of the individual, the uncontrollable freedom of expression. These opposing images were illuminated throughout the book. And when I turned the last page, my faith in God was greater.. Pamuk also has a sense of humor. Here's an excerpt of the chapter as told by a gold coin:. ""I once left Istanbul in the purse of a preacher from Edirne who was going to Manisa. ON the way, we happened to be attacked by thieves. One of them shouted, ""Your money or your life!"" Panicking, the miserable preacher hid us in his asshole. This spot, which he assumed was the safest, smelled worse than the mouth of the garlic love and was much less comfortable. But the situation quickly grew worse when instead of ""Your money or you life!"" the thieves began to shout ""Your honor or your life!"" Lining up, they took him by turns. I don't dare describe the agony we suffered in that cramped hole. It's for this reason that I dislike leaving Istanbul."". And as a final note… I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a tinge of worry or hesitation when hitting the 'Post Reply' button. Not a concern stemming from my pride. Nor a worry of blasphemy. But a fear of how certain words or phrases I laid down may be interpreted by those in whose country I am a guest, those who I believe through their pride are convinced that their interpretation of the Koran is the only true interpretation. That is the state of some places in the 21st century, a state similar to Istanbul of the 16th century.. Read this book. It is good.","Nov 10, 2008"

While Pamuk’s decision to frame his story, and philosophical musings, around a murder mystery reminded me of Umberto Eco’s “The Name of the Rose”, his penchant for humor, his unapologetic approach to sex and his willingness to use unique points of view gave the book a unique and pleasant style.","Apr 14, 2018"

A book full of LIFE!. If anything, it has gained more power in recent years, as we see Turkish democracy facing ever harder challenges, and various traditions clashing with liberal ideas and freedom of thought.

948535,Hallie,"After finishing this book I felt virtuous, relieved. Then baffled, irritated, and finally dismissive. Other Good Reads reviewers express the desire to like this book, but proceed to be confused, bored, and insecure. Most wrap up with the dismal feeling that they didn’t GET it, and so didn’t succeed in really liking it. I felt the same, but in addition was supremely annoyed and turned off by it. I’m not so good at post-modern fiction to begin with, but I decided to leave my bias at the door because I had heard such great things about this author, and Pamuk didn’t seem like a bogus poser from what I’d read.. The story is about an expatriate Turkish poet named Ka who leads a solitary and arid life in Frankfurt and travels to a remote village in his homeland, ostensibly to investigate a spate of suicides by religious Muslim women protesting the injunction to remove their head scarves at school. He is really there to kindle a romance with a recently divorced woman he knew at university. The novel unfolds over three days when the snow has cut off the town from the outside world. What transpires is a coup led by a dysfunctional theater troupe, a lot of political intrigue, and much ball batting between secular and religious townspeople. Pamuk gives equal billing to every opinion, although they do not differ much in terms of their reductive, inflamed and binary natures, or in ability to capture my interest or sustained attention. This is in large part because the protagonist Ka is stunted,childish and infuriating himself, and the writing is both busy and detached. The political intrigue and opinions in Snow are not interesting or illuminating, as they do not emanate from fleshed-out people, but cardboard cut-outs spouting giant, densely packed and tedious word bubbles.. Inspiration strikes Ka while in Kars, and he stops to transcribe a series of nineteen poems, whenever they descend on him in perfectly realized form. Conveniently they get lost, but a conversation about them between Ka and his paramour goes like this:. “Is it beautiful?” he asked her a few moments later.. “Yes, it’s beautiful!” said Ipek.. Ka read a few more lines aloud and then asked her again, “Is it beautiful?”. “It’s beautiful,” Ipek replied.. When he finished reading the poem, he asked, “So what was it that made it beautiful?”. “I don’t know,” Ipek replied, “but I did find it beautiful.”. “Did Muhtar [her ex] ever read you a poem like this?”. “Never,” she said.. Ka began to read the poem aloud again, this time with growing force, but he still stopped at all the same places to ask, “Is it beautiful?” He also stopped at a few new places to say, “It really is very beautiful, isn’t it?”. “Yes, it’s very beautiful!” Ipek replied.. To my mind, only a child under ten should ever be indulged in this sort of megalomania, and then only by his mother, but Ka is nowhere punished, ridiculed or even chided for his insufferable personality, and in fact I think we are supposed to admire him as embodying the innocence, purity, pathos and single-mindedness that come with being a true artist.. Margaret Atwood says, in the New York Times Book Review “Not only an engrossing feat of tale-spinning, but essential reading for our times. [Pamuk is] narrating his country into being.” This seems to me the best case for why Snow won the Nobel Prize. The book makes Turkey legible, as well as digestible, to the West. The novel is chock a block with allusions to white western male institutions – Kafka, Coleridge, Mann, Nabokov (he wrote a lot of stuff in the west, anyway): an annoying and intrusive narrator, a novelist named Orhan, whose games of peek-a-boo get harder and harder to humor, an abysmal, abyssal usage of literary envelopes, a morose and misunderstood genius of a hero who falls desparately in love with a woman he obstinately refuses to lend more than one dimension – the sex scenes, incidentally, are some of the most unintentionally off-putting I have ever read, and recall the experience almost every woman has been unfortunate to undergo at least once, where she feels she might leave the room, go get some cheesecake and stand in the door frame watching her partner rythmically brutalizing a stack of pillows in laughable ignorance of her whereabouts or even existence. Afterwards our hero has the witlessness to add to the injury by calling this essentially masturbatory act “love-making”. In fact, this pretty much sums up my response to the whole book.","Feb 28, 2008"
17295672,Jaidee ,"5 "" provocative, desolate, yearnful"" stars !!. 10th Favorite Read of 2017 (tie). To read Snow is to laugh loudly and cry quietly.. Kars, a small city in northeast Turkey, a backwater that had glory days and multiple conquerings over the centuries. There are Turks, Kurds, Azeris and a few Russians. Most of the men are unemployed and spend their days in teahouses discussing politics and religion. They are demoralized and oppress their women and children.. Ka is a poet of Turkish descent who now lives in Frankfurt and is a political exile. He comes to Kars to investigate the suicides of young Muslim women for a German newspaper and becomes embroiled in a world that used to be familiar and now so foreign. He is both revered and disdained by the townspeople and falls madly in love with Ipek, an old college friend that is separated from her husband who is running for mayor. The plot gets more and more complicated and farcical but not just in a funny way, in a convoluted way that speaks to the nature of identity, ethnic strife, fundamentalism, poverty and gender relations. So much happens in three days and you feel the sadness and despair permeate your being along with guffaws at the ridiculousness of men trying to make sense of their world and fear for women who are trying to survive and be safe.. The story is complex, beautiful and you reflect on your own existence and wonder if you are living the fullest life that you have available to you.. I very much look forward to reading more of Mr. Pamuk's work.","Nov 30, 2013"
614778,Ahmad Sharabiani,"Kar = Snow, c2002, Orhan Pamuk. Snow, is a novel by Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk. Published in Turkish in 2002, it was translated into English by Maureen Freely and published in 2004. The story encapsulates many of the political and cultural tensions of modern Turkey and successfully combines humor, social commentary, mysticism, and a deep sympathy with its characters. Ka is a poet, who returns to Turkey after 12 years of political exile in Germany. He has several motives, first, as a journalist, to investigate a spate of suicides but also in the hope of meeting a woman he used to know. Heavy snow cuts off the town for about three days during which time Ka is in conversation with a former communist, a secularist, a fascist nationalist, a possible Islamic extremist, Islamic moderates, young Kurds, the military, the Secret Service, the police and in particular, an actor-revolutionary. In the midst of this, love and passion are to be found. Temporarily closed off from the world, a farcical coup is staged and linked melodramatically to a stage play. The main discussion concerns the interface of secularism and belief but there are references to all of Turkey's twentieth century history.. تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز پانزدهم ماه دسامبر سال 2016 میلادی. عنوان: برف؛ نویسنده: اورهان پاموک؛ برگردان: شهرام دشتی، مشخصات نشر: تهران، البرز، 1386، در 624 ص، شابک: 9789644425608؛ چاپ پیشین: با ترجمه: سیمین موحد؛ نشر ورجاوند، 1385، در 687 ص. شابک: 9647656572؛ ترجمه از متن انگلیسی؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ترک، ترکیه، سده 21 م. برف؛ اثر: «اورهان پاموک»؛ روایتگر داستانی عاشقانه است؛ که در پس زمینه ی مشوش ترکیه ی امروز، که سرشارست از تنشهای موجود میان سنت و اصلاح طلبی، دین و خدا ناباوری مدرن و…؛ روی میدهد. داستانی عاشقانه که در فضای زیبا – و البته بعضاً فریبکار- شهری مرزی، که درگیر بورانی سخت شده؛ شکل می‌گیرد. کا شاعری تبعیدی ست، که به دلیل درگذشت مادر خویش، به ترکیه باز گشته است. پس از خاکسپاری مادر در استانبول، کا خبردار می‌شود، دختری که در زمان دانشجویی، از دور عاشقش بوده، از همسرش جدا شده، به قصد ملاقات او، به شهر شمالی قارص سفر می‌کند. او خود را روزنامه نگار معرفی کرده، و به بهانه‌ ی تهیه ی گزارش، درباره‌ ی مسائلی از قبیل خودکشی‌های اخیر دختران جوان، و انتخابات شهرداری که به زودی برگزار خواهد شد، وارد شهر می‌شود. کا دوباره ایپک را می‌بیند، و دوباره مسحور زیبایی‌ اش می‌شود، زیبایی‌ ای که به مراتب از آنچه که در یادش مانده بود، خارق العاده‌ تر است. او به این نتیجه رسیده است، که ایپک پاسخ تمام رویاهای او هست، در مدت زمان اقامت کوتاهش در قارص، با بیقراری تمام، ایپک را دنبال می‌کند. در هتلی که مالکش پدر ایپک است، اتاقی کرایه می‌کند، تا از آن راه بتواند راحت‌تر ایپک را ملاقات کند. پدر ایپک، کا را برای شام دعوت می‌کند، و کا با دیدن ایپک، بیشتر و بیشتر عاشقش می‌شود. کا به دلیل مصاحبه‌ هایی که برای گزارش نمایشی‌ اش با مردم انجام می‌دهد، بلافاصله درگیر وقایع روز شهر می‌شود؛ نامزد پست شهرداری؛ که کسی نیست جز همسر سابق ایپک، و دوست سابق کا، موهتار؛ خانواده‌ های قربانیان خودکشی‌ها؛ معاون رئیس پلیس؛ و حتی رهبر گروه تثاتر، سونای زعیم، که سالها پیش دوستی مختصری با کا داشته، و حالا برای اجرای نمایشی در سالن تئاتر ملی، در شهر است. کا بعضی از دانش آموزان دبیرستان مذهبی را نیز ملاقات می‌کند، دانش آموزانی که از او به خاطر صحبت کردن با دخترانی که حاضر به برهنه کردن سرهاشان نشده بودند، خوششان آمده است. آنها کا را به چند تن از رهبرانشان، «نجیب» و «فاضل»، که از قضا از طرفداران متعصب خواهر ایپک، ردیفه –عاشق سینه چاک و معشوقه ی تروریست اسلامی بدنام شهر، آبی (بلو)- هم هستند، معرفی می‌کنند. کا در مدت زمان کوتاهی که در قارص اقامت دارد، موفق می‌شود دل ایپک را به دست آورده، و چه زبانی و چه فیزیکی، عشقش را ابراز کند. این مسئله باعث می‌شود: کا بیش از هر زمان دیگری، در زندگی خویش احساس خوشبختی کند. با این حال، خوشبختی‌ او در سایه‌ ی تردیدهایی که در هر قدم، بر سر راهش قرار می‌گیرند، فرو می‌رود. البته یکی از عمیقترین اثرات این خوشبختی این است که کا دوباره توانایی سرودن پیدا کرده، و در مدت چند روز نوزده شعر عاشقانه سروده، که بهترین اشعار عمرش نیز هستند، اشعاری که گویی از وجود کس دیگری سرچشمه می‌گیرند. یکی دیگر از مسائلی که کا در زمان اقامتش با آن مواجه می‌شود، کشمکشی ست که در درونش در مورد اعتقاد به خدا وجود دارد. او بارها و بارها خود را خداناباور پنداشته، اما در زمان اقامتش در قارص، به دیدار شیخ اعظم شهر رفته، و عشقش به خدا را اعتراف می‌کند. با این حال، اسلام‌گرایان شهر، صحت ادعاهایش را به چالش کشیده، و او را متظاهری می‌خوانند، که تنها برای به دست آوردن نظر مثبت آنان، ادعای خداپرستی می‌کند. نهایتاً، در آخر، …؛. ا. شربیانی","Mar 23, 2012"
62704,Nate,"Nine Reasons I (strongly) disliked this book:. 1. The author made himself a character in his story. I just don't like that. I always wonder if they had writer's block and couldn't invent a fictional character to take the reins.. 2. A snowflake diagram of poetry is involved. I'll say no more.. 3. The men in this novel are whiny, infantile, and fall in love with every woman they encounter.. 4. In the same paragraph the female lead character is described as seething in hatred and laughing adoringly at the whiny, infantile male main character.. 5. This story has no cohesion. Things happen to the main character without foreshadowing. The exposition that did come was mainly philosophical and seemingly tangential. And if I have to read another sentence about whether a Muslim woman should wear a scarf or not or how beautiful and terrifying snow can be, I will go batty.. 6. I did not understand the motivations behind most of the characters' actions. This may be because I'm ignorant to the social intricacies of the Turkish realm. But this book did not help me to care.. 7. As a fellow poet, I hated that the main character wrote 19 poems throughout the novel, but the reader never got to read any of them. This point is explained in the story, but it still bugged me.. 8. The author inexplicably tried his hardest to make the novel seem like a biography even though A NOVEL is featured prominently on the cover.. 9. From this novel I am to presume that every Turkish woman is profoundly beautiful and that Turkish men can only drag themselves after these creatures in the hope of being noticed.. Bonus reason: two years later I'm still angry I read this book!","Oct 04, 2008"
17744555,BlackOxford,"An Aorist Country. Religion is rarely about dogma or belief and almost always about membership in a group and the feeling of belonging it creates.. Snow. is an absurdist novel about religion as community and its communal conflicts.. The protagonist, Ka, is a sort of thirty-something adolescent who finds himself in a blizzard, in love, in a state ruled by paranoia, and in the midst of a local revolution begun by a provincial theatre-group (remarkably like a Turkish version of Heinrich Boll's. Clown. ). This constitutes his isolated but very god-like, omniscient community:. ""In Kars everyone always knows about everything that’s going on."". But Kars, situated as it is in Eastern Turkey, is hardly a single community. Its history is Russian, and Iranian, and Ottoman, and even a bit of English. Its inhabitants are Kurds, and Armenians, and Georgians and Azeris as well as Turks. And even among the ethnic Turks there are as many communities as there are distinctive interpretations of Islam.. Each of these communities, according to their members, is created by God. Various physical aspects of the Karsian world evoke God for the various communities. For example,. “Snow reminds Ka of God!”. Particularly its silence. But this is his community; mainly because after living as an emigre in Germany for so many years, he has no other. In Kars, he finds solace mainly because he has discovered empathy. ""with someone weaker than himself,"". namely the poor, uneducated, confused provincial Turkish folk. But that isn't how the locals see things.. The locals have a variety of religious communities from which to choose, ranging from radical Islam to secularist atheism. This latter term is not one of belief but of membership:. ""...that word doesn’t refer to people who don’t believe in God: it refers to the lonely ones, the people whom the gods have abandoned."". That is, those who have no community.. Most of the local communities have a common enemy - the state. The state, since the destruction of the Ottoman Empire, has attempted to replace rather than include local communities within itself. But it is merely a source of what we have come to know in the age of Trump as 'fake news.' Moreover, also as in the Trumpian vein, the state is an aspiring religion, with the sovereign power that all other religions would like to have. It uses this power and legal violence to present a binary choice to the population:. ‘My Fatherland or My Headscarf.’. The intractable conflict created by this situation isn't new in Turkey (nor for that matter in America). It existed even in the Empire. In part Pamuk expresses this through constant historical flashbacks and frequent narrative references like. 'later I found out'. or. 'eventually we learned.'. But he also captures the repetitive character of Turkish life through an ingenious literary technique that probably can't be rendered exactly in English.. Like Classical Greek, Turkish has a verb form, the Aorist or Habitual, which, although expressed in English, isn't explicit. The Aorist aspect is one of timeless repetition. It connotes past and future as well as present. The sense of the Aorist can be shown most simply in the crude English expression 'shit happens.' It doesn't just happen now; it has always happened and it always will. Turkey is the ancient, empoverished, embattled city of Kars, writ large, with its. ""endless wars, rebellions, massacres and atrocities."". Shit just keeps happening.. The American version hasn't been written yet but it's long overdue.","Sep 30, 2017"
83582,Bill Kerwin,"The expatriate poet Ka returns to his native Turkey ostensibly to investigate a growing number of suicides among ""head scarf girls"" for an article in a German newspaper, but actually to reconnect with the beautiful divorcee Ipek whom he knew in college. While there, he is caught up in religious and political intrigue.. I thought the book was too long, and the characters didn't interest me much, but I really liked the way Nobel prize winner Pamuk creates the atmosphere of the small city of Kars (and its many kinds of people) during a great snowstorm. I also liked the way he portrays the Islamists of Turkish culture--and the secular revolutionaries and artists as well--as fiercely Romantic individualists who are angry at the West--above all other things--because we refuse to recognize and respect the individuality of their religious passion.","May 09, 2008"
20438238,Mutasim Billah ,"“It was as if he were in a place that the whole world had forgotten; as if it were snowing at the end of the world.”. My first foray into Pamuk territory, Snow is a book about an exiled poet returning to his hometown under the pretense of writing a journalistic article on a suicide epidemic. In his hometown of Kars, our poet encounters snow: a snowfall that changes things for him forever.. A blizzard. A military coup. A theatrical massacre. Encounters with love and betrayal. Violent fundamentalists and their pride. And, a man who has found poetry within himself. Here we have a book where there is a lot happening. I won't say that it is fast-paced as it takes time to finally pace up but once it does, the drama and the surge of events catch you off-guard. In hindsight, the book is very relevant considering the recent failed coup in Turkey in 2016. I found the drama to be a bit overbearing at times and the scenes can have an absurdist element to it that doesn't come very naturally from Pamuk. Yet, I found the book to be a refreshing read. I'll be looking forward to reading more from the writer.","Oct 27, 2017"
6743601,Jim Fonseca,"Written in 2002, this novel predates Pamuk’s winning of the Nobel Prize in 2006. The main character is a Turkish emigre, one of many who live in Germany. He is returning home after years away. We are told he ran into political difficulties with his poetry and decided to leave Turkey. He returns to Turkey ostensibly for his mother’s funeral, but he has also learned through the grapevine that an old flame of his is now divorced. His instinct is that this journey will change his life.. Once back in Turkey, when he needs a reason to stay on, he tells people he is a journalist doing a story on the “headscarves suicides.” A number of young women have committed suicide in Kars. Depending on folks’ political perspective, they killed themselves because they were devout Moslems banned from wearing headscarves in public; or because of their dire poverty; or because they were forced by their families to marry old men; or because they faced lives of virtual slavery to abusive men -- bearing children, cooking and scrubbing. A good part of the story centers on the production and delivery of a play about headscarves. They state-sponsored play comes across as reminiscent of the type of thing put on in Mao’s China that everyone had to attend.. Kars, where the novel is set, is a real city in the northeast corner of Turkey, near Georgia, and Armenia and not far from the Caucasus Mountains and Russia -- thus the severe winter weather of the title. Its nearness to many borders has also given it a complex ethnic and political history, with Greeks, Georgians, Kurds and Persians in its past and present. Abandoned Russian and Armenian mansions and other buildings figure in the story. One theme is that the city is “down and out,” destitute really, by-passed by the modern economy. It seems like twenty times the narrator walks the snow-filed streets and tells us he looks in on the teahouses filled with unemployed men smoking themselves to death.. During his visit, a week-long snowstorm paralyzes the city. In fact the snow receives so much emphasis that it make it almost what I like to call an environmental novel (like The Shipping News) where the environment is almost a character in the novel.. So the narrator is a small-time poet. (Are there any big-time poets left?) He’s hit a dry spell but his muse strikes in Kars and he writes a series of poems, or, we are told, “they write themselves” through his hands in a trance-like state. But he’s very analytical for a poet – we’re shown a geometric diagram he creates to show the relationships among his poems. He’s also obsessed with examining his level of happiness, deliberately trying to improve his happiness, and we all know where that leads.. There’s a lot of political intrigue. Turkey is struggling to remain a Moslem, yet secular state. There is a lot of police tyranny and censorship. The prisons offer equal opportunity confinement and torture for Kurds, communists, and Islamic fundamentalists. “…three days, that’s all it takes, three days and they’re dead: gone, shot, forgotten.” We are told fairly early in the story that the poet was assassinated after his return to Germany and that any number of groups could have been responsible.. The narrator makes a point of telling us about his beliefs in a geometry of opposites. We see this several times: his old flame has a sister; one sister is very modern and one a fundamentalist. We have atheists and religious fanatics. We are told that old Marxists and communists make good religious zealots when they convert. Two fundamentalist religious boys are “halves” of each other and when one is shot by the army, the other feels that part of the murdered youth has been reincarnated in him (the living youth). The poet’s biographer who narrates parts of the story after the poet is assassinated says that at times he feels he is becoming the now-dead poet.. One intriguing theme discussed a couple of times; Are strongly-held religious and political beliefs a luxury for the rich? Or are they the only consolation available to the poor? The blurbs are right in telling us this is a very political novel. It’s dense with themes, and overly long (it could be cut by a third) but still a good read.","Mar 03, 2016"
216890,Darcy,"[. In a lot of ways, Snow isn't much different from some of Pamuk's other novels--Ka wanders around Kars just as Galip wanders around Istanbul in The Black Book, and Ka's vacillation between acute perception of others and paralytic insecurities about himself is straight from Black in My Name is Red. It's almost as though Pamuk keeps writing the same novel over and over--a novel about how men define themselves, particularly those men who discover they no longer seem to fit into the very physical space they occupy; in this case, Ka can't decide if he can still be Turkish after living in Germany for so many years.. It isn't a question that the book ends up answering, either. Ka returns to Turkey only to discover that writing doesn't make it any easier to deal with the decisions he finds himself making throughout his stay in Kars: does he believe in God or not? Does he love Ipek or not? Should he stay in Turkey or not? Does he support Westernization or not? It would be easy to reduce this novel to a story in which East meets West through the figure of Ka, but the novel seems to be much more interested not in that intersection, but in what occurs when one tries to write about that intersection. In fact, this is a novel made up entirely of all kinds of writing--newspaper articles, play productions, poems, speeches, video recordings, and Ka's notes. All these are filtered through the narrator, who is attempting to locate ""Ka"" in those very documents--as though if one could simply find the green notebook, or discover the meaning of the snowflake diagram then one could concretely define Ka's identity. The end result is a rather nasty joke--Orhan Pamuk the narrator spends ages collecting all the bits of paper that comprise the life of Ka and then spends even more time piecing it all together, only to come up with not much: Ka is not a terribly interesting person. He's a washed-up poet and a crappy lover. The intense focus on identity leads only to a dead end in which Ka cannot be recovered through writing, just as the events in Kars cannot be explained or understood through the novel.. Ka's motivations, his misogyny, and his indifference to others generally go unremarked by the narrator, causing the reader to wonder where, exactly, the narrator's fascination with Ka comes from. It is, of course, an ironic fascination--in becoming so wrapped up in Ka and Ka's actions, the narrator has failed to understand the underlying problems in the system and in the coup: there is no ""right"" side in this novel--the secularists, the Kurdish Nationalists, the Islamic fundamentalists, the Westernized Turkish exiles, the ex-Communists are all simply passing around the same system of power. It is a system (and one that Ka participates in throughout the novel) in which women become icons for men, just as Ipek is an icon for Ka. As a result, the initial story that brings Ka to Kars--the suicide girls--drops out of the narrative until even Kadife becomes fed up with it. This story fizzles out as Kadife neatly sums it all up: ""I'm sick of hearing men talking about why suicide girls commit suicide."" It is this story--this initial narrative that Ka sympathizes with but does not apply in his own life--that provides the keys to the other stories of isolation, social pressure, and political coercion. But the suicide girls end up forgotten in this book as the men talk about them to the point of rendering those women only stories.. I like Pamuk's novels, but I find them very difficult to read. They are slow, philosophical, and the main character is often so contradictory as to be slippery. This novel doesn't have the same type of experimental structure as My Name is Red--the narrative framework is more subtle. But I think that given the focus on writing (Ka cannot discover himself through his poems, Orhan Pamuk cannot discover Ka through the novel, and no one can figure out the suicide girls), identity and politics, this strategy is better.. (hide spoiler). ]","Jul 24, 2007"
48483884,Michael Finocchiaro,"Pamuk's description of the delicate (and frequently upset) balance between secular and religious fanaticism in modern Turkey is a gripping story. It is told from a pseudo-autobiographical viewpoint (like DFW's The Pale King) and follows the (mis)adventures of the exiled poet Ka in his return to a town visited in his youth near the Armenian and Georgian borders of eastern Anatolia. The characters are drawn in a deeply compelling manner and there is so much happening that one is surprised at the relatively short lapse of time covered by the events in the book. While primarily a narrative, it sheds essential light on the struggles against radical Islam and is even more revelant now in light of the failed coup in Turkey in July 2016.","Aug 15, 2016"
55360,hadashi,"This novel has won a zillion prizes, and has received deafening international acclaim for the way it takes on the clash of the Islamic fundamentalist East & secular West while retaining the humanity of its characters. I disagree.. The book starts out fine, but it devolves into this really odd stream-of-consciousness craziness that feels like a fever dream and makes little sense of events at the end. In addition, the narrator keeps telling you what’s going to happen – big stuff, like deaths, etc. – and if it was supposed to focus me and keep me from being distracted wondering what was going to happen, it did the exact opposite. I ended up skimming the last third because I was so annoyed with how all plot tension was gone, the protagonist was quickly becoming a snivelly annoyance, and – here’s my main beef – no poems. Ka’s whole character hinges on the fact that he’s been blocked for all his years in the West, and when he comes “home” he has this rush of nineteen poems that just flow out of him. A great deal of time is spent talking about them and dissecting them, but because the green notebook he wrote them in is never found, we never get to actually read them. I find this to be a cheap, lame, cheater literary trick that shirks responsibility. The plot structure even would have allowed at least one poem to be printed, but why couldn’t Pamuk have done even that?. The one thing that struck me was listening to characters wrestle with the idea of God and His relationship to life, and even that was presented as either fanaticism or a mind-salve for miserable people – nothing joyful or life-affirming.","Apr 10, 2007"
337591,Zinta,"I read a few sample pages of Snow in the bookstore, drawn by its blurry, snowy cover; drawn by a recent New York Times review; drawn by its non-westernized roots in Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk; drawn, too, by curiosity at this recent Nobel Prize winner for literature. The first few pages mesmerized me, the scene of a Turkish poet riding a bus through the snow capturing my imagination even as I left the bookstore.. ""The silence of snow, thought the man sitting just behind the bus driver. If this were the beginning of a poem, he would have called the thing he felt inside him the silence of snow..."". Snow never stops falling throughout this lengthy novel, and indeed becomes a barometer of the human condition. ""Snow"" is also the title of a poetry collection the Turkish poet, Ka, writes over its time span. A diagram of a snowflake is his diagram of his core self, with branches into imagination, reason and memory. As snow gathers over the events of the story, it becomes at times a blizzard, at other times a gentle white blanketing over a trampled earth.. Ka is traveling to the city of Kars to write an article about an epidemic of suicides among young Turkish women. As the force of westernization has entered the predominantly Muslim city, these young women have been ""freed"" to discard their head scarves. Their religious beliefs, however, are such that to bare their heads in public is more than they can bear--they would rather die. While investigating the suicides, Ka meets recently divorced Ipek, and he is instantly enthralled. The ensuing story is as much one of political rebellion as it is love story, complete with executions, betrayals, love found and love lost, and mysteries never quite solved.. I've grown up on European literature, with its dense and intricate plotlines, stories with no particular rush to reach conclusion and no linear path in getting there, in contrast to the fast-paced western literature with spare plotlines, quick action, and neatly wrapped-up endings. Of course, there are exceptions, but when I am in the mood to sink deep into a multi-layered tome, I choose non-western literature, and when I want a quick tap-dance of literary skill, I choose American literature. Each has its own pleasures. Snow is no exception. I enjoyed this blizzard, even if at times I lost sight of the path for all the white stuff.. Even the love story reminded me of the difference in the expression of love in different cultures, with Ka's falling into something nearing a worshipful obsession, immersing himself whole into the object of his affection--while a westernized love story would be more geared toward seduction and conquest, less about the dance of courtship and romance. There is surrender to the heart with nothing left in reserve in non-western literature that fascinates me. Do or die. Love or leave. For this reason alone, I enjoy reading literature by a variety of international authors; each provides a view into a varied perspective and life sense.. In any culture, however, the human heart breaks for the same reasons. We read of Ka's devastation at learning his beloved has betrayed him with another--from this heartbreak is seeded a suspicion of murder (did Ka or didn't he?). The scene of confrontation between Ka and Ipek is perhaps the novel's most moving: hearts are shattered even as they continue to find comfort in each other's arms, a fatal mix of love threaded with hatred, and finally released by the chill of apathy. Pamuk writes of the complexities of love as far more baffling than reason alone might explain, and each time as unique as a snowflake.. Snow is not a quick read. Nor is it an easy one. Like Ka's love, it requires immersion and a certain degree of surrender. It is a skilled and often marvelous novel, even if I am not convinced it is worthy of the Nobel. I would say not. Yet it is worth the effort to move through this snowfall, if only for the occasional moment of sheer literary mastery.","Sep 02, 2007"

You sit down in your seat and hear the familiar strains of the instruments tuning.. Only for the ensemble to sit, instruments in their hand doing absolutely nothing for 4 minutes and 33 seconds! 4 minutes and 33 seconds of COUGHING, fidgeting and someone shouting ""When are they going to start?"". This is how this book is to me. You think it's going to be brilliant because it won a Nobel prize. Surely it should be excellent? The best book you've read full of interesting characters that come alive on page and draw you into the book.. Well, you're not going to get that from this book. You'll get the narrator going on and on about snow, about how beautiful Ipek is and even what seems like it would be interesting; the conflict between religion and secularism, women's rights and poetry IT'S NOT! Because this book focuses on the dull, bland main character Ka.. Also, worse crime of all AUTHOR SELF INSERTION!. Trying to read this book again. It still sucks! I still can't stand it! The writing. The characters! Everything about it annoys me. I thought Saints by Orson Scott Card was annoying.. 6/8/15. Making the horrible mistake of trying to read this book again. It's awful. Bad enough you'd die of alcohol poisoning drinking the weakest alcohol if you drank every time you saw the word snow in this book but I am at a part where an extremist takes a gun to a principal and goes on and on about head scarves and how girls wearing headscarves will keep them from being raped or harass. He goes on about how headscarves help a man respect a woman.. But you should respect women as people in the first place and NOT rape or harass them whether they're in a bikini or naked or covered from head to toe! Men are not evil rape beasts who have to harass every woman they see unless she covers her hair.. UGH! I despise this book!. Another thing that sucks about this book is it's a sausage fest. It's like all the interesting stuff about these young girls gets pushed aside and no one cares about them. The rest of the women and girls in this are just props or love interests to obsess over. Not real complete people. Avoid this like a plague. A plague would be easier to deal with than reading this damn book.. December 21, 2018. So because I clearly hate myself i read this book again.. It's still terrible.. How is every single character in this book obnoxious and annoying? Every woman just exists as some man's fantasy. Men in this book think they are in love because they see a pretty woman and go *boing* you are not in love, Ka, you're just horny! You don't even know this woman. You re like, come with me to Frankfurt. Ok, and what will you do for her? She has to leave her elderly father which you made go out on a dangerous mission so you could have bad sex with his daughter! You just want a mother you can make love to! All through the book Ka sees people get killed, sees the body of teenagers and all he can think about is sex with Ipek!. Then you have the narrator who is the author inserted into this book. I swear the people of Kars, Turkey need to collectively kick his butt for how their town was portrayed by him. It's bad enough that in Saga Hazel knows things that make me go how do you know that, you were an infant and you weren't there but Saga has fascinating characters. This book doesn't. Especially the author who confesses his love to his own fictional woman.. Who does that. Why did this book win a Nobel prize? It pains me! The constant mention of snow. The conflicts that make me scream IF SHE WANTS TO WEAR HER HEAD SCARF LET HER WHY IS THIS EVEN AN ISSUE?! Don't marry your daughters off to icky old men. Being an atheist doesn't make you a bad person. Stop being so smug, Blue, you're not even supposed to have premarital sex, you are Muslim! And you had sex with 2 sisters and one sister's friend. Why the hell did they even like you so much?. How is it believable that this actor staged (heh) a coup like this? Over a dozen people get shot and everyone is so nonchalant about it all. It seems more dreamlike than realistic.. And what kind of a friend tells the entire world what kind of porn his friend liked? A real bro would delete his bro's browser history.. And even tho Orhan got one poem down we don't get to see it. We don't get to see any of these perfect poems Ka wrote and it angers me so much. Why mention them in the first place if they won't even actually be in the book? Or is it because the writer can't write poems or get a poet friend to write them for him?. Plodding through this book is like trying to walk through 5 feet of snow when you're 5 3 1/2. Unpleasant!

58296635,Sidharth Vardhan,"""To play the rebel heroine in Turkey, you don't pull off your scarf, you put it on"". If you were interested in the whole controversy raised by ban of veil in France a few years ago, then this book too might interest you. It is based on. real events. in a modern and secular Turkey. Here too there is a ban on wearing head-scarves in universities and like, though this is in a country where the majority of the population is Muslim but rulers are still liberals (or rather ultra-liberals). As a consequence several innocent religious women are deprived of their right to education and, forced to choose between education and religion; they end up committing suicide. What made their misfortune worse is the guilt they must have carried to graves since Koran prohibits suicide. And so, in a way, they must have felt condemned by the very religion they were fighting for.. To me, the book shows that the dangers of ultra-liberalism. Liberals should and must fight for the oppressed - Turgut Bey, a liberal who is also one of the better characters, argues ""It's not enough to be oppressed, you must also be right"". I find Kadife more agreeable who puts on scarf, not for religious reasons but to protest against an unjust law. Here liberals are causing the oppression by forcing their values on unwilling people.. Most people sort-of get married with their religious beliefs over time, to force them to leave behind their religion is like forcing a drug addict to abandon his drugs. To begin with, it is inhumane. Next, it is too late - it will create a lot of pain and you probably won't succeed. And even if you did, religion (or drug) will leave behind a void (a sort of need it has created in person for itself) and the person will never be comfortable. Marx was right when he said religion is the opium of masses. It is the case here.. The suicides are, of course, turned into political symbols. Some good religious young men disturbed by what is being done to women took to revolt. Pamuk managed to humanized one such young man by making him tell the protagonist about his love for a girl who had committed suicide and his own wish to be a science fiction writer.","Oct 17, 2016"

Pamuk reminded me of what really defines a novel, what moves it beyond a series of events and into a world and Pamuk's Kars is certainly its own world, full of characters whose degree of nuance is exactly as deep as those in a real place--in life you don't know everyone well and so to should it be in a novel. But if what makes a novel a novel is the creation of a world, what makes a novel good is the creation of a tone, a space, a way of seeing the world that reaches outside and it is this quality which I really loved. It's hard to describe, and I think the Russians do it best, Gogol in particular, but Pamuk constantly maintains a funny sadness that is neither light nor depressing. I am sure there is a word for this in some language, but it is complete and it made me forget that I was reading at many points. However, it is also distinct enough that I can see how not everyone would love it. You have to read for the humor, indulge the poetry (this is not a veiled language reference, I mean the actual poetry in the text) and take the characters just seriously enough to care but not to mourn. So maybe, just to indulge my english teacher self once more, what makes a novel great is also this quality--it must be singular enough to be disliked and good enough to love.","Sep 02, 2007"
3521888,Niledaughter,"I read excellent reviews here ; which convinced me that I can not add any new ! but since I am a Muslim & An Arab ; I could feel a lot of the depth of this book which showed me Turkey with a very cruel -but caring- anatomy that even the brilliant sarcasm made it more painful! By considering this fictional book as a new and useful approach for me to what are not so far different wounds from ours ; I will write my words …. For me ; it is a magnificent novel , a heart breaking one ; discussing the contemporary Turkish conflict between political Islam , tradition & even on a bigger scale ... the national identity. - from a side and secularism , modernization & westernization - from the other side . this conflict was presented in the novel by fanatics from both sides producing a complete bloody chaos , with the poverty & unemployment as the main feeder for its continuity ! but this analysis - which is done by both: a political & a philosophical methods - was not dry , it Was sensed through icons ..people .. lives that I can feel , get closer to & share the darkness they had in 3 days of isolation to its extreme , Yes .. the main events took place in only 3 days ! so the novel has a slow melody , but even though ; it is full of unexpected turns !. with Orhan almost taking no sides .. no right or wrong , he let me assume what I want & try to answer the un-answered questions !. Orhan is not easy to read , I stopped at his intellectual conversations a lot ; doing my best to understand . I loved his characters with their human weakness , confusion & passion , I will never forget. Ka. with his loneliness & desperation ..regrets & his sad love story , or his words :. ”Here I am , abandoned & wasting away . I carry the scars of unbearable suffering on every inch of my body . sometimes I believe it’s not just you I’ve lost, but everything in the world “. I can not stop thinking of. Blue. ! how much he angered me & confused me ! His statement :. ”When the Ayatollah Khomeini said that (the most important thing today is not to pray or fast but to protect the Islamic faith ) I believed him. ” may explain the huge range of confusing contradictions about how a religion can be manipulated with ! I could not totally hate him nor avoiding feeling sorry for his destiny , because of the blurring facts around him that leads to the uncertainty about the other face of any coin !. And the most of all :I will keep wondering about. Ipek and Kadife. ; their weird relation! And the feminine role in general ; keeping in mind that the suicide girls is a main debate in this novel .. I think this novel will stay with me for a long time , just keeping me wonder & cry ..?!","Apr 19, 2010"
11255849,Cheryl,"And the quiet of this empty city was as if the world had come to an end, and it was snowing.. If this were the beginning of a poem, he would have called the thing he felt inside him the silence of snow.. He walked the city in the cold, alone with his poems. Around him, snowflakes formed a blanket of white silence. He traversed Kars, a remote city in Turkey, where he found the poor forgotten, where democracy he saw was nonexistent and the Western world shunned. He, a prodigal son, never fully welcomed, a loner misunderstood, a man with the sort of angst only seen clearly through poetry. There, like the snow, he walked the city quietly, thoughtfully, observantly, deliberately, and Kars became his muse.. But- just as the poem itself defies easy explanation - it is difficult to say how much he decided at that moment and how much of his life was determined by the hidden symmetries this book is seeking to unveil.. Can one ever know the underpinnings of a man's heart when he is in love with a woman at the same time he is in love with the art of poetry? What explains best the shards of a person's soul when he is faced with a home no longer familiar, a city no longer his, a woman who was never his, a mindset unique from that of his peers? Loneliness and despondency are certainly themes in this book, as Ka is faced with those darkening thoughts, even as he experiences moments of euphoria. Politics and religion are bigger themes threaded in each chapter and the socio-political-economic climate unfolds with consistency. This is not the easiest book to maneuver, not the simplest unfolding of plots, but it certainly is intriguing to visit the mind of a political exile, to visit the daily lives of characters trapped behind vocal cages within their own homeland.","Feb 12, 2018"

Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks veils all over their bodies that is most convenient that they should be known and not molested: and Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful."". Ka is travelling by bus: a white scenario outside unfolds: it’s snow, relentlessly falling…and he falls asleep.. Ka, or Kerim Alakuşoğlu, a Turkish poet, returns to Kars, an old and small city north-east of Turkey. Kerim, a 42-year-old unmarried man, has been for 12 years in Frankfurt, Germany. There, it’s been four years he doesn’t write poems. He took refuge in the library where he can find books enough for “twenty lifetimes”.He especially likes Turgenev: the Russian writer. He doesn’t bother much learning German: “my body resisted German language”. But he meets with fellow Turks. Ka has only two fears in his life: fear of not being natural and fear of writing bad poems.. He considers himself to be a political exile in Germany; a “correct and sad” man like the heroes of Chekhov; someone who likes solitude.. Ka was condemned for an article he didn't write.. Until the 1970’s, people could write everything in Turkey: nobody went to jail; but, after the military coup, things got different;… so, he fled to Germany. Meanwhile his mother died, and he had to return to Istanbul. After that, he decides to go to Kars: while traveling by bus to the remote city he lies to someone who inquires him; Ka says he’s going to Kars because he’s a journalist and will report on local elections and the suicide-of-women problem. But he’s going to Kars hoping to find beautiful İpek, and to ask her to marry him.. İpek attended college with Kars. But then got married.. Ka will stay for three days in Kars where 40 % of the population is Kurdish. While strolling around the city Ka notices cafes are filled with unemployed Kurds. It’s a deserted-looking city; yet full of History: the Russian period (1877-1918)…and the period when some Armenians were rich. You can still contemplate millenarian Armenian churches there.. (above, the cathedral where once the ""talented"" Armenian child George Ivanovich Gurdjieff sung). There are billboards in Kars saying: ”The Human Being is a masterpiece of God, suicide is an insult”. They try to halt the suicide rate.. In Kars, while talking to the local newspaper editor, Ka sees the snow keeps falling: an incredible amount outside.. Purging snow?. ...There’s a cry for solitude …everywhere.. Why are women committing suicide in Kars?. A suicide rate that is four times above world-average. Some say it all started in Batman village (a bastion of the Turkish Hezbollah): women are suicidal too. Explanations include premeditation….and women being manipulated.. In Kars he meets İpek Hanim; she’s been divorced. She’s the daughter of the hotel manager, where Ka is lodged at. They speak about mothers who died;…while they talk at a café a murder takes place just before them. It’s a religious motivated homicide.. One of the murderer’s motives is rooted on the precept/question: should women cover head and face?. *. İpek’s father (Turgut Bei) is a communist. One of the candidates in the local elections is Muhtar Bei; he wants to re-marry İpek. İpek’s sister is a militant of the Islamic veil.. One day Ka talks to Muhtar at the party's office; Muhtar admires the snow show outside.. Ka marvels at the grace and tranquilizing force of the snow; its silence gets him closer to God.. .... People liked the Refah Party; it was the most voted in 1995; but in 1998 it was dissolved by decree by the generals’ pressure.. This is truly a political novel,…and Ka who never got interested in politics,… (Ka so far buried in silence) is about to be dragged into it.

929238,HBalikov,"The country known as Turkey is a strange and important place. It chose a sectarian path for its government after the fall of the Ottoman Empire and for the past two decades it has moved closer and closer to Islam. It has great resources, great antiquities, and great poverty. Its people are more ""Westernized"" than most others in the region. It has hinted that it wants a much larger role on the world stage. It is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Association and has been waiting to have its membership approved for the EU. There is a long-standing issue of taking responsibility for the mass-murder of Armenians during and after World War I.. I wanted to get a greater understanding of Turkey's politics, culture, daily life, etc. Who better to provide the instruction than Orhan Pamuk, Turkey's Nobel prize winner for literature. Snow is a fantastic (literally) political novel set in Kars, a city that has had a greater past than its present or likely future. To add to the mystery, Pamuk names his journalist, Ka, and we are never quite sure whether he arrives in a continuing blizzard (metaphor?) because of a story concerning young girls and headscarves; or, because of his interest in Ipek, a former paramour; or, because of the coming election. All the conflicting political and religious movements of the country are brought to a boil in this city: socialism and communism, atheism, political secularism, Kurdish nationalism, and the most rapidly growing movement, Islamist fundamentalism. Ka comes into contact with all of them. The minister who has banned girls who wear headscarves from attending school. When the minister is attacked and killed, Ka is drawn further into the conflicts.. There is plenty of action and, also, periods of reflection but, it is as if they are presented through a blizzard that clouds the reader's perceptions and makes it difficult to reach any conclusions. Who is judged a danger to the state? Who sees Ka as an objective journalist and who sees him as a threat? How much does this change when a putsch takes place during a performance at the National Theater? If Ka chooses to try to flee, will Ipek go with him?. The reader is challenged on many levels. It is as Churchill said about another country in the region. ""It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma."" And, perhaps, this is what Pamuk is trying to tell us about his Turkey.","Aug 15, 2015"
1235793,Reid,"I work with someone from Bulgaria, and from time to time she gets so gloomy that I simply have to say (with a smile), ""Could you, for God's sake, stop being so Eastern European?"" Thus with this book, which is set in Eastern Turkey (more Asia than Europe, but still...).. This novel falls squarely into the category of books I admire far more than I love. Into this same file folder I would place masterpieces such as. The Brothers Karamazov. and. Les Misérables. , but with those the brilliance of the storytelling far outweighs their shortcomings. Not so here. Though Pamuk is recognized as a first-rate author, and I do not gainsay his talent, unlike these more accomplished works, after the first 200 pages or so of Snow, it began to feel like a depressing slog, and then it went on for another 250 pages after that.. Yes, I recognized his method here, the rather meta construct involved. Because the residents of Turkey (and in particular the town of Kars, in the far eastern part of the country) were and are living through their own depressing slog, which seems to be broken up only by the terror that from time to time enters their lives.. This book was very timely for me, too, because while I was reading it, the terrorist attacks in Paris took place. Much of the political confusion and mayhem that occurs in Snow is the result of the very conflicts that are also happening in the wider world.. Still, although I stuck with it to the bitter end, it just didn't feel worthwhile to have put myself through the experience. Perhaps I am being shallow and not capable of the deep engagement required to stick with a work like this. So be it. Nonetheless, I can't help thinking that an artist has a certain obligation to give us something to hang on to as we read. There is some (very dark) humor to the book, and some love. But these feel meted out in such small, parsimonious packets that I had a very hard time understanding why I should bother.","Nov 21, 2015"
94602,Kelly,"When Orhan Pamuk won the Nobel Prize in 2006, his Nobel Lecture, entitled “My Father’s Suitcase” contained many passages expressing what he felt it was to be a writer, why it was that writing was essential to his life. There are a few phrases that I believe directly explain both the reasons for this novel's existence and why it is written the way it is:. ""A writer is someone who spends years patiently trying to discover the second being inside him, and the world that makes him who he is.... ...I write because I am afraid of being forgotten. I write because I like the glory and interest that writing brings. I write to be alone. Perhaps I write because I hope to understand why I am so very, very angry at all of you, so very, very angry at everyone..."". Orhan Pamuk's. Snow. puts one of his ""second beings"" on display in this novel, the questing, lonely poet Ka, whose story drives the action. But we are not allowed a reliable narrator, in any sense of the word. Ka himself is a wandering man in search of who he is, a man who changes his mind and opinions every moment, who is on a journey of becoming, not being. And more than that, we are getting his thoughts through the filter of the author of the novel, who calls himself, ""Orhan Bey"" a ""friend of Ka's,"" and who is reconstructing this brief period in Ka's life for his novel. As he makes clear to us again and again, he can only guess at certain parts of Ka's experiences- even when we cannot see the author's voice at all, we know that he is creating this supposedly non-fictional man out of his own thoughts, dreams, memories and experiences as much as he is reconstructing events from hard evidence. And so, in a more straightforward, less mystical way, Pamuk continues the exploration into the loss of geniune voice and identity that he captured so well in. My Name is Red. . But here, he brings it out of a metaphysical, inner world, and out into the every day, mundane open. Although some readers may find this device somewhat ham handed (or downright annoying) and perhaps a breaking of the ""show, don't tell,"" rule, I would argue that Pamuk's device is consistent with his existing body of work and is very effective at conveying the experience he is trying to write about here. Would one prefer to relax into the story? Sure. Is anyone here really allowed to? No. The reader gets the same experience that the characters in the novel do.. He depicts his poet Ka on a visit to Kars, a remote, decaying town (that once used to be a great provincial center) far from the cosmopolitan center of Istanbul- a symbol of Turkey's place in a Western/Euro-centric 20th and 21st century. He arrives in this town in the dead of winter, just as a large snowstorm is gathering, a storm that effectively traps him in the city until the roads open days later. This novel is the story of those few days in a community sealed off from the world. The snow means many different things to different people, and we see how that plays out over the course of these days- with results that largely end up more or less disastrous for all sides.. Ka himself was purportedly drawn to the city to write an article about the ""suicide girls,""- a high number of local women and girls who had committed suicide in a very short period of time, a story that had gotten some play in Istanbul and Germany. Though his real motives have more to do with love, nostalgia and the reclaiming of a lost past (again, a pretty direct symbol of Turkey), Ka nonetheless finds himself named the ""poet from the West,"" and runs into the gamit of local opinion on politics and society- die hard Kemalists, ex-communists, socialists, Kurdish nationalists, spiritualists, feminists, Islamic extremists, etc. Orhan Pamuk makes no bones about this being a political novel, and makes sure to show us all the elements that Turkey has to deal with as a state- a state that, mind you, proclaims all of its residents ""Turks"" and does not officially recognize any other identity within its state. He ends up embroiled in the machinations of everyone who fights with or against everything they believe he stands for (ie, the West), and despite all his attempts to escape (he says over and over towards the end of the book that all he wants is to be happy and get out of Kars alive), he cannot escape what is happening to him.. As usual, Pamuk deals with the problems of the East/West divide and his poor country that is caught in the middle. He has many characters beg only for some clarification of who they are and what they are- an explanation for why there are so many extremists in the area. At one point a young teenage Islamist says, ""Please God, help me preserve my purity, protect my mind from confusion,"" as a group of political activists of all stripes attempt to come up with some sort of statement to make to ""the West"". (The West may seem a strangely archaic term, out of the Cold War- but this book shows how relevant it still is for many people, long past its use as a military alliance. The countries who were used as proxies in that war haven't forgotten the reasons they were given for those wars happening to them.) He also deals more generally with the problems of being a person who exists ""on the periphery""- ie, anyone who doesn't live in Europe or North America.. He has one person very eloquently express this problem as he says:. ""When they write poems or sing songs in the West, they speak for all humanity. They're human beings- but we're just Muslims. When. we. write something, it's just called ethnic poetry."". Pamuk has his characters express over and over, in so many different ways, that all they want is to be human beings as well. Some people feel that that is best accomplished by trying to be as much ""like the Europeans"" as possible, some feel that it is best accomplished by being the opposite of everything they believe that is if only to carve out a separate identity that won't be subsumed (or ""be forgotten"", the fear that Pamuk expresses above) into the greater ""Western"" culture, some believe it is found in Islam, the religion that they believe their personhood is reduced to when viewed through outside eyes, etc etc.. This is perhaps both the biggest and most painful part of the book. No one is allowed to do or say anything without it being representative of something else, without someone feeling that they are taking sides with them or against them. Everything someone does is ""for Europe"" or ""for Islam"" or ""for the Kurds"". People are told the reasons that they're doing things, or think the reasons that other people think they are doing things, before they examine their own reasons. Case in point in this novel is the women- the ""suicide girls"" and the ""head scarf girls"" and their leader, Kadife, sister of the woman our poet is in love with.. Every choice these women make is discussed endlessly- one side decides for them that they did it because they were poor- and everything that comes with it. Another side decides they did it for ""honor"" and religion- whatever the creed they represent tells them that women are supposed to be motivated by, and unsurprisingly, the few women that we see depicted appear to be driven crazy by the experience, whether they buy into what they're being told or not. The one woman who doesn't seem to is Ipek, the woman that Ka is in love with. She is shown as being affected by every day things that we would see characters in a ""Western"" novel being affected by- her failure to have children, her husband's professional failures, her daddy issues, her competition with her sister, the perception that people have of her due to the way that she looks. Ka appears to be drawn to this for a number of reasons, but I think one of them is that he wants to be as outside the present as she seems to be, as detached from the ugly realities that seem to be destroying everyone else.. It is a talk heavy book for this reason- everyone seems to believe something fiercely and feels the need to repeat it over and over again, and shout it over whatever other people feel. It's an atmosphere where it is a novelty to ask questions of the other side, and preconceptions are almost always voiced before asking for answers (""I know as an atheist you must think about suicide all the time, but..."" ... who in the what now?). And I think underneath all this is the recognition that not only do these people not know if they really believe what they profess to, they usually don't know what it means, why they believe it, and you know what at the end of the day: what they believe doesn't really matter anyway. They're not important enough to matter- their identity has been totally devalued. And everyone, but everyone, knows it.. It is a slow, meditative book, as you might expect from something called. Snow. . Expect long digressions into philosophy, spirituality, religion, politics, and long long legacies of inferiority complexes and hatreds (particularly of course, against the perceptions of Europeans and the West)- Pamuk's explanation about why everyone is ""so very very angry at everyone else."" It has a plot, certainly, and one that can get your heart racing at very specific moments, but it will be followed by long walks in the night grasping at something that, as Pamuk put it in his Nobel Lecture, ""one never quite gets to."" It is a surreal place, and it is meant to be- a city blanketed in snow far away from the rules of every day life. It can be a black comedy at times, in a very sick way- of course his characters don't even know it. They spend so much time and energy talking about how they don't want to look foolish in the eyes of foreigners, and yet the moments when some of them are the most sure are the ones that get the reader to pity them the most. Not that the book wants that either. He has his characters get a say in what they want said- no one knows what they want to say to the West, but in the end it seems to add up to the fact that they are not figments of our (and by our I mean readers in Westernized countries) imagination that can be categorized into things like poor people to help, depressed people to pity, extremists to fear or really just: Other. At one point the novelist has a conversation with a former teenage Islamist who says:. ""But I can tell from your face that you want to tell the people who read your novels how poor we are and how different we are from them. I don't want you to put me in a novel like that."". ""Why?"". ""Because you don't even know me, that's why! Even if you got to know me and described me as I am, your Western readers would be so caught up in pitying me for being poor that they wouldn't have a chance to see my life. For example, if you said I was writing an Islamist science-fiction novel, they'd just laugh. I don't want to be described as someone people smile at out of pity and compassion."". Even as Pamuk gives us this slice of life in Turkey that he's deliberately shown us comes so close to reality, he reminds us again that we haven't seen the real thing and perhaps we never can see the ""real thing"" in each other, that our perceptions are doomed to be incomplete and fuzzy, covered in a blanket of snow.. I would recommend to anyone reading this that you find a brief summary of Turkish politics before diving in- I don't think in depth knowledge is necessary, but I do think knowing what Kemalists are, what Article 301 did, what the role of the army is, and what happened in the 2002 elections are all essential for fully appreciating what this book is. Of course one can appreciate it solely on its artistic merits, but it is a political novel that is meant to address some gaping wounds in the country, and I think that it should be respected as such, or you'll miss out on a lot. Also, patience. Lots and lots of patience.. It will pay off, though. You'll find out why everyone is so very angry in the end, and I believe that you'll find that that knowledge is very much worth the having.","Dec 29, 2008"
2026178,Elizabeth (Alaska),"This book came to my attention nearly 4 years ago, soon after I became a member of Goodreads. So, when it came up as an option for this quarter's challenge, I happily put it on my list. I was too stubborn to put it down.. The prose is pedestrian and uninteresting, occasionally boring. There is no real character development. The women are beautiful (or fat), and one of the important, but minor, characters has blue eyes. That doesn't count as character development.. My biggest objection, however, is content. There was frequent, hate-filled dialogue from political Islam constituting an attack on the West. To be fair, this did not come from the main character. In fact, he was usually the target of this hate speech as representing the atheistic west. I didn't know he was an atheist until told so, long after he realized that snow made him think of God. I found it unbelievable that right out of nowhere would an atheist think of God when he saw snow.. This is on Boxall's 1001 Books You Should Read Before You Die. Opinions vary. My opinion is that you would die more easily and happily without having read this.","Apr 24, 2009"
5875398,Rebecca,"(3.5). This novel seems to be based around an elaborate play on words: it’s set in. Kars. , the Turkish town where the protagonist, a poet known by the initials. Ka. , becomes stranded by the snow (. Kar. in Turkish). Ka is back in Turkey, after 12 years spent in political exile in Germany, for his mother’s funeral. While he’s here, he decides to investigate a recent spate of female suicides, keep tabs on the upcoming election, and see if he can win the love of Ipek, who is an old friend and also the daughter of the owner of the Snow Palace Hotel, where he’s staying. There’s a hint of magic realism to the novel: the newspaper covered Ka’s reading of a poem called “Snow” before he ever even wrote it. He and Ipek witness the shooting of the director of the Institute of Education – an attempted assassination to avenge him banning girls who wear headscarves from the schools.. As in Elif Shafak’s. Three Daughters of Eve. , the emphasis is on Turkey’s split personality: a choice between fundamentalism (= East, poverty) and secularism (= West, wealth). Pamuk is pretty heavy-handed with these rival ideologies and with the symbolism of the snow. By the time I reached page 165, having skimmed maybe two chapters’ worth along the way, I couldn’t bear to keep going. However, if I get a recommendation of a shorter and more subtle Pamuk novel I would give him another try, and I did enjoy the various nice quotes about snow (reminiscent of Joyce’s “The Dead”) – it really was atmospheric for this time of year.. A favorite line:. “That’s why snow drew people together. It was as if snow cast a veil over hatreds, greed and wrath and made everyone feel close to one another.”","Mar 03, 2018"

1386971,Marieke,"This is my fourth Pamuk novel and the more of his work i read, the more i want to read his work. The first one i read, i read in college:. The White Castle. . All i can remember is that i really liked it and it made me want to read Pamuk (i need to re-read it now). Then a few years out of college, i got. My Name is Red. and tried to read it. This was well before goodreads and i didn't have anyone to save me from frustration, so i stopped reading it thinking i'd take it up later at some point. I read it fairly recently with my Middle East/North Africa group here on goodreads and it turned out to be a tremendously rewarding experience. i shook my finger and scolded my younger self for having given up so easily. Especially because. My Name is Red. was not the only book casualty from that earlier experience. It made me wary of trying to read. Snow. , even though i knew it dealt with topics that interest me and in which i'm fairly well-read, not necessarily in the Turkish context, but i should not have been afraid. About a year ago i got. The Museum of Innocence. from the library. I'll be honest: it was hardbound with a plastic library protective sleeve, it was chunky, it had appealing cover art...i had to have it. I was a little cautious starting it, but it sucked me in. I loved it. Towards the end Pamuk ties the book to. Snow. and it was like an epiphany for me. I WILL BE SCARED NO MORE.. And now i have read it, thanks to the Worlds Lit group moderator putting it on the schedule for the beginning of our exploration of Turkish literature. I still have to get caught up on the discussion in that group. Normally i participate in discussions at the same time i'm reading, but this book unfolds and unfolds and unfolds...i just wanted to experience it for myself without interference from others' reactions. Part of my reason for doing so is not so much a fear of spoilers, but Pamuk is an evocative writer and i wanted to just get lost in the mood he created for me. I think this is one of the things i most like about Pamuk now that i have embraced his work: He has a style. it may not be a unique style, but it is distinct. Yet each book is an individual with its very own atmosphere; you know you are absolutely reading a Pamuk novel but it doesn't feel like any other Pamuk novel (or any other novel for that matter) you have read. I wanted to get lost in that, and i did. I normally get annoyed and frustrated if i don't finish a book quickly enough. i read this for a much longer period than i had intended, but i don't regret it. His writing is somewhat meaty, but not at all difficult to chew if you let yourself just sink your teeth in.. About the book itself--there are layers to this story and i'm not sure i have properly absorbed all of them. Also, there were some aspects that were odd to me and i'm still trying to get my finger on those, so i'm going to hold out on commenting on those for now. I still have to join the discussion and also, i think i just might be re-reading this someday.","Jan 07, 2013"
5204784,Vonia,"This is my second read from Orhan Pamuk. The first,. The Museum Of Innocence. , was immediately shelved as an all time favorite, so expectations were high for Snow. That being said, I was a little disappointed, probably largely attributed to the fact that this was also a political intrigue plot, something I have never had much interest in. However, I had no difficulties recognizing the melodious, picturesque prose with the power to seduce me into another, forgotten world that I so loved from. The Museum of Innocence.. I have read more than one professional review noting Pamuk as the contemporary writer ""most likely"" to represent Turkey for The Nobel Prize in Literature. Really, I am confident that this is a formality, as there really is no competition. He, and he alone, is responsible for the rest of the world recognizing his country's stature. In the literary world, no other Turkish writer today can hold a candle to his name; his works, his abilities in expressing the struggles along with the grandeur of his beloved country.. Snow. is very aptly titled. Its metaphoric meaning is scattered throughout the text, parallel to the literal vignettes describing the constant downfall in the city of Kars, where our hero, Ka, is visiting. Ka, the name he prefers (from his initials) to Kerim Alakusoglu, is an exiled poet. Many years ago, after being involved in politics for some years along with Ipek and the narrator, a poem he wrote led to the need for him to escape from Turkish authorities to nearby Germany. Visiting Istanbul, seeing old friends for the first time in many years, he was given the ostensible reason to visit Kars by a friend in newspaper reporting. A very religious and political heavy election campaign needs coverage. Alongside the political campaigns is the story of the head scarf wearing girls whom have begun committing suicide in an unsettling number. His real interest in visiting a city so deep in poverty and violence is in the interest of love. Namely, a mutual friend of theirs from youth, Ipek, recently divorced, is now residing in Kars with her father, whom owns the hotel there,and her sister, Kadife, whom happens to be the leader of the aforementioned ""head scarf girls"".. The local government had recently started enforcing laws requiring them to remove the scarves in higher education establishments, thus forcing the sixteen year olds to choose between their fiercely ingrained religious beliefs and their desire to receive a higher education. A small number of girls have refused to acquiesce to such enforcement tactics from the government (the aforementioned ""head scarf girls""). Unfortunately, under pressure from their family, friends, neighbors, a few have taken their own lives. This is saying a lot more than what one might at first believe, as The Koran very clearly designates suicide as a sin. These girls, then, have obviously been placed in such dire emotional states that they would rather risk facing the consequences inherent in this sin than the lifelong internal pain they have identified with removing their scarves.. As one might predict, such intense political content can only be with an equal amount of overt religious themes, discussion, philosophies. Greatly unsatisfied with life, not quite suicidal but bordering such affectations, Ka admits to expecting Ipek to be his one and only chance at happiness. Essentially an atheist, he also begins to ""find God"" in Kars. Along with many other religious overtures I do not care to discuss, I found these portions to be quite trying to read through.. Tying the political, religious, and psychological themes together is Ka's poetry. Not having been able to write poetry for many years, they begin to be ""told"" to him during his time in Kars. (By some higher power, so he feels. ) Although Pamuk describes the poetry, even includes an appendix listing the chapter/page # when Ka wrote all nineteen is his anthology, readers are never able to see one in full. This was quite disappointing, as they would have augmented the story well. I guess Orhan Bey is not a poet in addition to a novelist. As seems to be common for the author, Orhan is again a character in the story, as our narrator, a close friend of Ka's. It was nice to see The Museum Of Innocence actually mentioned by name here (Orhan says he discussed writing this with Ka shortly before his death), but for the most part, the metafiction approach was far less effective than it was in The Museum Of Innocence. In fact, I found the excessive foreshadowing and nonparallel storytelling quite disconcerting. It hindered the flow of the novel greatly. Some foreshadowing is great, but the narrator (yes, Orhan) does it several times regarding the same thing; other times it feels like he is simply giving away an ending that I, as a reader, do not want him giving away! One example of how the structure did not work for me is the seemingly randomly placed chapter twenty nine in the middle of the story in which Orhan tells readers about visiting Ka's apartment after his murder. This was placed in between two chapters that follow one another chronologically. It was like being awakened from a dream, then reentering in chapter thirty. Not something I liked, at all.. In all, it was still an engaging read despite these things. This is due to the writing. Beautiful, proficient, insightful, always managing to describe things with simplicity yet with depth in understanding. Looking forward to another Orhan Pamuk, but this time I will look for his less political/religious themed titles.. Orhan Pamuk is not creating an original psyche in Ka. What he has done, rather, is illustrate it with language so melodious but insightful that he might as well have.. Ka's nineteen poems, all written while he was in Kars, serve as a sort of guide to the narration.. ""Ka explained that when a good poet is confronted with the difficult facts that he knows to be true but also inimical to poetry, he has no choice but to flee to the margins: it was, he said, this very retreat that allowed him to hear the hidden music that is the source of all art."". Indeed, Ka himself saw them as a guide to his very being, having divided the poems into the three axes of Memory, Imagination, Reason, inspired by Bacon's Tree Of Knowledge. At the center were the words, ""I, Ka"". This snowflake can be seen on page 261 in the text.. A final central theme of the story is that of loyalty and allegiances. Sunay Bey's loyalty to his true love, the theater, although he uses it for political purposes; each of the sisters' allegiances to each other, but also to Blue, in their atypical love triangle; Necip & Fazil's loyalty to their religion, as well as each other (gay?); even the not so obvious loyalty the citizens of Kars have to their city.. ""Life is not about principles, it is about happiness,"" Ka states.. ""But if you do not have any principles, and no faith, you cannot be happy at all, "" Kadife disagrees.. ""That is true. But in a country like ours where human life is cheap, it is stupid to destroy yourself for the sake of your beliefs. Beliefs, high ideals... only the rich can have such luxuries."". ""Actually, it is the other way round. In a poor country, the only consolation people can have is the one that comes from their beliefs."". The aspect of the novel I appreciated the most was Ka's transformation, really, from a depressed, unsatisfied man with little expectation that he would ever find a real reason to smile in life to someone whom began embracing it. At least for as long as he was able to love Ipek:. ""Suddenly, Ka realized he was in love with Ipek. And realizing that this love would determine the rest of his life, he was filled with fear."". Unfortunately, the contradictions inherent in his personality led to him often hurting the prospects for what he correctly deemed to be his one chance at true love.. ""Ka had always shied away from happiness for fear of the pain that might follow... His most intense emotions came not when he was happy, but when he was beset by the certainty that this happiness would soon be lost to him."". Ka was a moralist whom believed that. ""the greatest happiness comes from never doing anything for the sake of personal happiness."". Despite all this, he was able to experience bliss with her:. ""As he and Ipek made love, he heard music play inside him, music he had never heard before, never even imagined, and it was by obeying its harmonies that he found his way forward.... From time to time he fell asleep, dreamed of summer holidays bathed in heavenly light... He was free, he was immortal; his plane was about to fall out of the sky but he was eating an apple, an apple he would never finish, an apple that would last for all time.... Guided by snow light and the faint yellow glow of the streetlamps, he would press his eyes against hers and try to see into them... It seemed to him they were two, basking side by side in shallow water; it was only then he realized that they were holding hands."". Now, who can rightfully say that is not beautiful?","Apr 15, 2015"
60795629,Jose,"There are books that besides being captivating by the fluidity and prowess of the narrative, also offer a sense of implicit wisdom and belonging. This book enters that category. It might be redundant for this review to state so considering the renowned dexterity of the Nobel awarded author, nonetheless, such sensibility discerned along the redaction was a surprising contentment.. While the topics covered by the book are quite complex to elaborate on in a novel (for instance the social perception of religion, dogmas and customs experienced by a hesitant participant), Mr. Pamuk delivered an intelligently shaped piece of writing, where a smartly defined characterisation and a brilliantly managed time-line provide at its core a sense of identity to the reader.. The story, narrated by a third party, tells the comeuppance of Ka, a middle-aged poet who in returning to his city of birth with the initial intention of researching the case of a group of suicidal girls related to a veil banning policy, ends up in a deepening voyage of self realisation and awareness of his secluded community.. An enjoyable read with beautifully described Turkish sceneries within a historic setting that offers a social critique of current relevance, such as the role of women in a struggling Islamic society and the quandaries of a community facing opposing western mentalities.","Nov 04, 2018"
9086236,Chaitra,"This is going to be a rant, even more so because this book is written by Nobel Prize Winner, honored for how he represents Turkey in his books. It made the NY Times Best Books for 2004. Where is the saving grace of this piece of junk trying to pass itself as a novel?. Ka. , the pompous main character is probably the vilest creation I've come across in a while. That's an achievement, given how much I dislike most protagonists. This idiot is an exile, who comes back to Turkey for his mother's funeral. Once that is done, he reveals his utter selfishness, and decides to travel to Kars. He has noble intentions - to write about some election that no one cares about and to examine the string of suicides among Karsian women. But his all-encompassing in-your-face obsession is Ipek, the beautiful woman who now lives in Kars, is single, and who Ka wants to marry without actually knowing her. Because you know, when your name is Ka, you think,. ""I can never fall in love with a woman unless I know nothing about her."". He then proceeds to do everything in his power to fuck her, oops sorry, to. ""make love"". to her, for example, sending her old father off to a potentially dangerous meeting with a known terrorist who he knows is being monitored by the state. But, what can you do, he's in love. And he will be so happy with Ipek, he just knows this! When they do ""make love"", Ipek looks a bit too confident - not fragile enough for our hero - so he hurts her. She, being the idiot masturbation fantasy (for the author as much as the characters, he even admits it in the novel) that she is, enjoys the fuck out of it. From there the plot devolves into utter stupidity, surprising me as to the depths it could sink to, considering how low it was to begin with. It's definitely deeper than the ""true love"" referred to in this book.. Pamuk introduces issues very early in the novel -. covered girls, poverty, Islamist political movement, the craziness of the state, suicide. . But these are just for show, and to build up to the 436 pages (in my edition) of the novel. Every time someone begins to talk about the issues, and gets in about two lines, the author cuts to Ka, who is daydreaming about the many ways he can fuck Ipek instead of following the conversation. If the main character does not think that any of these issues are interesting, why should I, the reader, care? In any case, Pamuk barely scratches the surface of the rich material available to him. For example, twice he paints himself into a corner pertaining to a covered girl's faith, and twice he uses the same out -. I am not going to discuss my faith with an atheist!. Pamuk cleverly does not write a theist who could drag this explanation out. As for the suicides, that's just a frame. No one bothers with it after Ka does some initial half-hearted investigation, apparently no girl decides to bother with suicide while he's there. Some investigative journalist he would make too - a more incurious literary journalist you'd be hard pressed to find. He just blows with the wind, and stops the would-be interesting plot routinely at least twice in a paragraph for the following reasons in any order:. 1. How beautiful Ipek is! How much he loves her! How they'll be happy in Frankfurt!. 2. How beautiful the snow is! I can hear the silence of God in it for the first 200 pages of the book! After that I'll conveniently forget that I had any dilemma about God. But, even then, the snow is so fucking beautiful!. 3. Hold your military coup for a freaking minute! My brain is like an incontinent bladder and it's leaking a poem! Go boil your heads for ten minutes while I scribble this down!. 4. Isn't my poem beautiful? Isn't it really beautiful? I'll put it down on the memory axis of my nice little snowflake, leaning towards the imagination axis.. (Authors Note to the Readers: Suckers! Ka lost the poems!!!! I'll waste 300 pages carping about his poems, but I'll refuse to include them in the novel. Nope, not even the one that I say I recovered from a TV program. You can all go fuck yourselves.). 5. Ten minutes after 4, ah! Ipek doesn't love me! My poems don't come anymore! I want to die!!. (Readers: Please go find a well, Ka. Ka ignores the readers, and goes back to 1 after spending a couple of lines on LE ISSUES!). To get back to the serious issues, even if Pamuk refuses to,. women in this book. are portrayed abominably. Also, shall I dare say this? They conform to every stereotype the non-Islamic world has about Islam and women. There are only two main girls in the book that supposedly deals with women: Ipek - the paragon who everyone is in love with, and Kadife - her sister, a covered girl intensely jealous of her sister. They ultimately establish the view that whether covered or bare headed, woman is objectified. What's more, she's ok with being treated the way she is. Everyone seems to fall in love with one woman after the other. Ka is indecisive to the point that several times he wonders if he might make out with Kadife while he's mentally masturbating to the image of Ipek. Ipek seems to have one trait: her beauty. She doesn't have any pride, no matter how horribly Ka treats her (or the terrorist Blue for that matter). Her only moment of decisiveness comes because of a man. There is a lot of lip service paid to the fact that Kadife is very respected because she chose to wear a head scarf, but all this is undone when it is revealed that she did it to get into bed with Blue. Blue is a player - he sleeps with Ipek, and then two-times her with Kadife, then two-times Kadife with a random girl who's supposedly her friend - and all this achieves is that the women share some kind of twisted bond. Even before that, when she supposedly stands in a room filled with men and is able to pronounce something provocative and win the respect of everyone, she can only do so because she's sleeping with Blue. And when Blue storms off in a snit, girl is completely traumatized and regrets everything she's said and is willing to do anything if only Blue would speak to her! Some role models these paragons are.. There are so many glib pronouncements in the book that I would be quoting it in entirety if I were to comment on that. All the characters seem to be stuck at a mental age of four. But, I was disappointed even before I could read ten pages of this book with the poor language. I have no idea if it's something specific to Turkish writing or it lost something in the translation. These are some examples of what I'm talking about. Ka and Kadife are strolling around Kars talking about Blue, when Kadife says, ""Everyone's afraid of him. We are too. These are the butcher shops."" At another point, Ka is absolutely untroubled by the fact that he will fall in love with Ipek. In the next sentence he is filled with dread by the very same thing. If I made a drinking game of any of these words/phrases -. ""happy in Frankfurt"", ""Ipek...beautiful"", ""snow/snowflakes"", ""fallen in love with [insert female character of your choice]"", ""had a poem coming on"". - I would have died by alcohol overdose midway through the book.. I could expend more vitriol on the book, but I'm tired, and my head hurts, and I hope I never remember this book again.","Dec 17, 2012"
7321024,Rositsa Zlatilova,"Snow. is a tale of disparate yearnings – for love, writing, happiness, power and religion – that Pamuk, in his swift, masterful way, succeeds to tangle together.. The story follows the political processes in today’s Turkey. It draws the red line between radical Islamists and Western secularists, and illustrates why and how they cannot coexist, and how devastating the results of this inability can be.. Snow. is told through the story of exiled poet Ka in his return to a desolate Turkish town and his rendezvous with families and friends of girls who committed suicides, because they had been forbidden to wear their head scarves at school, with a woman with whom he was madly in love with, a religious boy who was searching for his identity and dreamed of becoming a fantasy writer, and a covered woman who was trying to establish herself and win the love of a magnetic fundamentalist, who never killed anyone but, according to rumours, ordered some people’s death.. Everything that happens in the book happens in an emblematic snowy atmosphere whose calmness brings Ka closer to God and shakes the religious beliefs of strict Muslims living in the provincial town of Kars. These contradicting perspectives provoke the alarming question of whether strongly-held religious beliefs are a territory kept just for the poor and is atheism only possible for the rich? Also, where is the place of women in the Turkish society? The painful reality is that women of Kars kill themselves, because they hope to gain something, while men kill themselves because of ideological confrontations and because they have lost hope of gaining anything.. At a larger scale, Pamuk brings the topic of impossibility of happiness – that is ever so prevailing in his novels – by expressing an opinion that life is not about principles, but about happiness and in a country like Turkey, where human life is cheap, it’s pointless to destroy yourself for the sake of your beliefs. Only people in rich countries can afford such luxuries.. Snow. is an enriching reading experience about politics and religion, love and hate, art and primitivism, belonging and non-belonging, the East and the West, and you can, rightfully, wonder why I haven’t given it a higher score. The truth is that it dragged out too much (too much even for Pamuk’s melancholic style of writing). If it was a book written by someone else, I would have probably given it a higher score, but having known what Pamuk had achieved in his other novels, I thought he could have saved us some of the repetitiveness and made. Snow. less suffocating.. Is my scoring fair then? I suppose no, but, at the same time, if you are Orhan Pamuk, you raise the exceptions quite high.. And so, a brilliant work by itself, but just good for what Pamuk can actually accomplish.","Oct 31, 2018"
55219317,Amber,"""In a brutal country like ours, where human life is 'cheap', it's stupid to destroy yourself for the sake of your beliefs. Beliefs? High ideas? Only people in rich countries can enjoy such luxuries............Ka thought it strangely depressing that the suicide girls had had to struggle to find a private moment to kill themselves. Even after swallowing their pills, even as they lay quietly dying, they’d had to share their rooms with others.. How much can we ever know about the love and pain in another's heart? How much can we hope to understand those who have suffered deeper anguish, greater deprivation, and more crushing disappointments than we ourselves have known? Even if the world's rich and powerful were to put themselves in the shoes of the rest, how much would they really understand the wretched millions suffering around them? So it is when Orhan the novelist peers into the dark corners of his poet friend's difficult and painful life: How much can he really see?”. Heaven was the place where you kept alive the dreams of your memories.. every person has a star, every star has a friend, and for every person carrying a star there is someone else who reflects it, and everyone carries this reflection like a secret confidante in the heart.. Immersing oneself in the problems of a book is a good way to keep from thinking of love.”","Oct 14, 2017"
2156200,K.D. Absolutely,"It took me almost 2 months to read this book because for many times, reading it is like a chore. However, there are some brilliant parts so I continued reading hoping that there were lots of them especially in the last 50 pages. I was not disappointed. The last parts really made sense and Pamuk made sure that the political message like. Turkey is in search of its own identity as a nation. is well-entrenched in the mind of his readers.. But what country is not in search of her identity? Even the Philippines has this dilemma. Or maybe it is just a matter of perspective. The story revolves around. Ka. the exile poet from Frankfurt who decided to go back to Turkey to investigate the reported suicide of young girls in his hometown, Kars. While there, his past relationship with a childhood sweetheart. Ipek. is rekindled. The problem is that Ipek has married and is now divorced but in love with another man, the rebel. Blue. who is also in relationship with Ipek's sister. Kadife.. This four-sided love story amidst the suicide, the assassinations, the coup by a disgruntled theater troupe. All of these amidst the heavy snow that at the first part is so vividly described that I felt like I am missing a lot by living in a tropical country. Then of course, there is. Orhan Pamuk. the character in the book that narrates the whole thing and that at some points in the novel is directly taking to his readers by explaining what's happening. He, towards the end, went to the place retracing the life of Ka. I absolutely liked that part as if the Ka's life story is about to begin again with Orhan Pamuk. Or Ka and Orhan Pamuk are one and the same person. Brilliant storytelling technique that I have not seen yet in the 300+ 1001-Books-You-Must-Read-Before-You-Die books that I've read so far.. What I thought worked against my really liking about this book is the long and winding repetitive parts about taking the head scarves or not. I know this is a big deal for Muslim people but I just could not relate to that and shame, the problem is mine. I also thought that the theater scene is corny. Had that been turned into a Fall-of-Saigon kind of coup and killing that would have been more enjoyable.. Overall, I still like this book. It made me understand Turkey as a country and I am happy to having tried (and finishing) an Orhan Pamuk's work. Maybe this is not his best. I have a friend who is raving about. My Name is Red. (tbr) so maybe I should read that one later this year.","Apr 22, 2010"
15736557,Lynne King,"To have two abandoned books in one evening is not good. In fact this has never happened to me before.. However, I just didn't like this book at all and skimmed through it. The idea of this individual called Ka, a celebrated poet, who goes to Kars reporting on the elections and also checking on girls who commit suicides, I found somewhat bizarre. When I arrived at Chapter 8, ""Girls Who Commit Suicide are not Even Muslims"", well that just about finished it for me.. In my opinion, there were words leaping all over the place without any meaning or substance. I arrived at the end and thought do I need to torment myself? No. So into the ""cloud"" it sailed.. I see that Mr Pamuk was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006 and that he's ""one of the freshest, most original voices in contemporary fiction"".

58203072,Carlos,"A suitcase. An old leather suitcase in a discreet corner of a room filled with books. That was what his father left him. His legacy. And the suitcase remained untouched for a long time before he had the courage to open it. This is what. Orhan Pamuk. talks about in his Nobel Lecture to the Swedish Academy in December 2006. The suitcase represents the identity of a writer. Its content is full of crucial questions.. That brings to mind another suitcase. In. Lyudmila Ulitskaya’s. engrossing novel. L'échelle de Jacob. the narrator finds the missing elements of her grandparent’s story in a suitcase her grandmother gives her before she dies. And as with. Pamuk. , at first she lacks the courage to open it.. In. Snow. , his fifth novel, suitcases appear in important moments of the story. As Ka gets off the bus, he is carrying his suitcase. Ka, the main character, is a poet living in exile in Germany. He has arrived in Kars (a town in Anatolia bordering the Caucasus) hired as a reporter for an Istanbul newspaper to cover the coming elections and investigate the recent suicides that have shocked its population. Some chapters ahead, beautiful and mysterious Ïpek, in her home at the Snow Palace Hotel, is deciding what to put in her suitcase, preparing for her long trip. Meanwhile, in his hotel room in Frankfurt, mournful Orahn Bey (our narrator) is filling his suitcase with Ka’s belongings, frustrated because he has not found the green notebook. Later, Ïpek goes to Ka’s room, takes his suitcase and sends it with an envoy to the train station. When Ka is given the suitcase, he’s vainly looking for Ïpek: she will not join him. Heartbroken, he gazes desperately through the window. And in the last chapter Orahn Bey walks carrying his suitcase to the train station. As the train leaves, the tears distort his last vision of Kars.. The novel is deeply influenced by the Russian literary tradition. In a number of interviews. Pamuk. has acknowledged his admiration of the great 19th century writers, in particular. Dostoevsky. and. Tolstoy. . The concept that a novel constitutes a collection of philosophical, religious, ethical and political ideas, is very close to him. That a writer’s fundamental obligation to his time is to portrait it as best as possible, using the adequate narrative skills and tools that each writer carries in “the old leather suitcase”. And thus, the opening chapter brings to mind the beginning of. The Idiot. , when Prince Myshkin and Rogozhin meet while riding a train on a cold November morning. In. Snow. , it is not a train but a bus Ka is riding, and it is during cold and snowy February in the tip of Anatolia. And although his companion will not be an important character later on, they engage in conversation about the city where they will arrive hours later.. Another Russian writer is very much present and named throughout the novel. In his first day in Kars, as Ka is walking the snowy streets, our narrator tells us that someone is playing a melodramatic song and. “it made him feel like the sad romantic hero of a. Turgenev. novel, setting off to meet the woman who has been haunting his dreams for years.”. Pamuk is giving us a few more pieces of the plot. Ka is sad deep inside and is about to meet the woman he has secretly been in love with for years. As we learn of the lonely life he leads in his small apartment in Frankfurt, we begin to understand the motivations of the poet and his spirit that morning. And so, we learn that Ka loves. Turgenev. and his elegant novels and like the Russian writer, Ka is. “tired of his own country’s never-ending troubles”. . In Germany, he gave poetry reads to support himself. When he was not traveling, he would leave his apartment every day and walk to the local library, where he sat for hours rereading. Turgenev’s. novels from cover to cover. The Russian novelist is present two more times: in the Kurdish maid whose expression, half conspiratorial, half respectful, was straight out of. Turgenev. and towards the end, when Turgut Bey. “reached shamefacedly into his pocket and pulled out a new edition of. First Love. , the. Turgenev. novel he’d translated from the French while he was in prison.”. The first time the narrator describes Ka, we learn that he is forty-two years old and has spent the last twelve years as a political exile in Germany, that he is single and has never married. His real passion is poetry. He is like those “. Chekhov. characters” so laden with virtues that they never know success in life. As snow continues to fall in Kars. Pamuk’s. descriptions with the word COVER abound:. As the snow covered the steep mountains no longer visible in the distance; and empty snow-covered squares; ice-covered branches of the plane trees and the oleanders.. The snow that. covers. the ground is replaced by the veil. covering the head of women.. Pamuk. has taken a single word and projected it into the story with incredible force.. “A woman who has covered herself is making a statement”. , we read during a discussion in the first chapters. In a move that enraged Islamic groups, the State had banned covered girls from the classroom. Some of these girls, feeling outraged, found in suicide the only consolation left. RELIGION is critical in the plot.. Very often, writers refer to the process of creation using all kinds of metaphors that describe the actual moment of enlightenment, or the lack of it. In Ka’s case, INSPIRATION had abandoned him. For years he had not written a single poem. As he discovered love, he also felt a transformation deep inside. The first poem, and the subsequent nineteen he wrote in Kars, came as a sudden urge that could only be satisfied by sitting down and writing what his mind dictated in that precise moment. I watched once. Jorge Luis Borges. describe in an interview how Kafka dictated him a poem during a dream, and how he wrote it the moment he woke up, fearing that if he didn’t, the poem would be gone forever. Ka, a day dreamer by nature, received inspiration when well awaken. All he had to do is sit and copy down the poem dictated by his mind.. An experienced writer knows that to reach a climatic section -I’m referring to a certain kind of narrative (because as we all know, each novel follows its own rules, based on its own particular architecture)- it has to be done gradually. The reader has to feel the ascending ramp, even the effort it takes to climb the steps one by one. In a 500-page novel, to reach this summit at around 30% of the way is the result of a conscious decision from the writer. Pamuk mentions very early in the story the big event taking place at the National Theater in Kars. He is following his Russian masters to the letter.. Chekhov. is believed to have said that if something appears in the first act, then it must reappear later in the play. In his own words. ""If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there."". The Russian writer’s adamant insistence on removing unnecessary or irrelevant elements that could mislead the reader is worth stressing at this point. It is the news of a performance at the National Theater that Ka reads in Serday Bey’s office in the second chapter, when he has just arrived in Kars, that stays in the mind of the reader, waiting to happen. Adding an element of magical realism, the note describes in past tense what will happen later on: “Ka, the celebrated poet, who is now visiting our city, recited his latest poem, entitled “Snow.” The already printed copy of the Border City Gazette astonishes Ka, who has not written a poem in years. Serday Bey explains:. There are those who despise us for writing the news before it happens. They fear us not because we are journalists but because we can predict the future; you should see how amazed they are when things turn out exactly as we’ve written them. And quite a few things do happen only because we’ve written them up first. This is what modern journalism is all about.. The event appears later, announced in posters on outside walls, and in a cable the runs through the city to be able to broadcast the event live. As we’re approaching the climactic scene, Ka is at the Snow Palace Hotel watching TV with Ïpek and her father. The moment has come. This section constitutes one of the pillars that holds the plot of the novel, the other one is a similar stage performance in the same theater, much later. Both act as axis in the structure, surrounded by all the important themes mentioned earlier: religion, inspiration, beliefs, politics, the West, provincialism, violence, solitude, love and integrity.. “If a writer is to tell his own story,. says.

Perhaps Ka is a reflection of himself, a hint at his own solitude and suffering, or maybe Ka was his friend in real life and he is just writing his story, as he pretends in the novel. Regardless of the real facts,. Snow. remains a work of fiction, where I find. Pamuk. is in top form throughout. Narrated for the most part in third person, the novel slowly shifts to first person towards the end, as the character and narrator strangely merge. His ability to uncover hidden aspects of a character’s personality, as well as his meticulous descriptions and impressive handling of the dramatic elements of the story, are present all across the book. The way he conveys a feeling, for example, hinting only at a shadow of an idea, is remarkable. To feel the gaze of a pair of eyes and experience trembling, based only on a single line description is simply exquisite.

5407952,Jibran,"Some disjointed thoughts below. I will straighten them out later to write a coherent review of this very exciting novel.. ---. Nearly all low-rated reviews complain about cardboard characters and their singular fixations, thinking it a deep flaw in the novel. But this is so by design. They are character types invented to map the logic of the conflict between Westoxified Kemalist secularism and regressive Islamist fundamentalist in contemporary Turkey by subjecting them to brutal satire. Sunay Zaim, the theatre actor, symbolises the former; Blue, the alleged terrorist on the run, depicts the latter. They are caricatures of comical dimensions, and everything they do attests to that. While in-between we have Ka, the poet-journalist, who has come back to Kars and is caught up in a thrilling chain of action that would end in a disaster. Then there is the lead female character, the beautiful & divorced Ipek, who stands as a symbol for Turkey in how she is used and discarded by competing parties for their own end.. It is not easy to stomach Pamuk's stunningly repetitive improvisatory monologues, his going on and on has an effect of spinning in concentric circles that shrinks it to a dot while at the same time the narrative spins so fast everything will tumble out of it and crash against your irises. This novel is bit of a mindfuck, but a mindfuck I loved!. I also think one's lack of insider's familiarity with Turkish culture and history is not an impediment. The bit of history Pamuk has used, in the context of Kars and some events that give a background to the antagonism between Islamists, Kemalists and Kurds is sufficient for the sake of the story. The emphasis is on the sum total of the comical - the illogical, the absurd, and even the hilarious. For example 1) girls in droves committing suicide due to a ban on hijab! Sunay Zaim the devoted Kemalist blowing up the threatre and massacring the audience just so he could lay the blame on the Islamists and prove they are brutal killers! The pious fundamentalist with puritanical ideas who is willing to die for his cause having an illicit love affair with a woman! And the closing scene on stage in the theatre ended in Kadife shooting Sunay was brilliant in how it merged fiction and reality.. I think Pamuk has done a remarkable job with what he'd set out to do. The fact that everything in its complexity happens in just three days clearly indicates that it's not supposed to be a realistic novel. It is an allegory with a Kafkaesque twist.. Margaret Atwood was right on the money when she called it ""essential reading of our times."" Its novelty felt a little dangerous. But it was a 5-star novel sans a doubt.","Feb 24, 2014"
257105,Ayu Palar,"A Turkish poet coming home after his exile in Frankfurt goes to a city named Kars to meet the woman that he loves (or to be exact, he is obsessed with). If you’re familiar with Macondo in. 100 Hundred Years of Solitude. , you’ll find the same gloomy and mysterious atmosphere in Kars. Although, Kars is much much colder than Macondo since it’s surrounded by nothing but snow.. So, this poet known as Ka decided to visit Kars so that he can meet this beautiful woman called Ipek. While Galip in. The Black Book. shows his true love by roaming the city of Istanbul to find his lost wife, I found that Ka is a man who thinks nothing but sex. The only thing in his mind is how to make love with Ipek. He even sets up a plan so he can make love with Ipek while her father isn’t home (a barrier for Ipek to have sex with Ka). Ka’s sexual crave is also shown by some paragraphs that mention Ka is attracted to Kadife, Ipek’s sister.. Yet. Snow. isn’t just a love story. It also reveals the systemic oppression to the believers in Turkey. A suicide plague happens in Kars. The interesting thing is that all girls who committed suicide wear head-scarf, a symbol of honour (to the believers) yet also a symbol of repression (to the atheist). If these girls truly believe in God, why did they commit suicide, a great sin according to the religion? This clash between the believers and the atheists (represented by the Republican) finally erupts in Kars. A stage drama turns into a massacre, and wearing head scarf becomes a symbol of rebellion. And this idea is delivered gracefully by Mr. Pamuk. I feel that he writes this down without any intention to take side. He just simply wants to describe what is happening in modern day Turkey, and Kars is the microcosm of the country.. Snow. is a novel with an idea that is relevant with contemporary problems. However, in my humble opinion, the weakness of this novel lies on Ka, the main character. He’s not a strong and decisive character, but as a weak and dilemmatic character, he’s not convincing either. I understand why the women in the story will fall for Blue (the political Islamist) instead of Ka. While the strength of. Snow. is on how Mr. Pamuk builds Kars with words. You can feel the atmosphere of loneliness and despair of the city. After reading. Snow. , maybe snow no longer looks beautiful for us.","Sep 29, 2009"
108788,Tim,"This book is gorgeously written, hypnotic, and probably too long. Snow permeates the book, and Pamuk's descriptions have the effect we get from noticing that it is snowing slightly outside--we get a small, pleasurable jolt of surprise that pulls us away from the action briefly. Of action there is much. The characters are trapped in the city of Kars, which serves as an effective external mechanism for putting pressure on them to act and interact. The book starts to get really interesting fairly early on, I'm going to say Chapter 5, when we switch from Ka's perspective to a recording of a man who we know prior to reading the chapter has died. We are privy, then, to their final conversation. This chapter is riveting, the dialogue that much starker because we know the end result. The plot thickens at various points in a manner reminiscent of. Crime and Punishment. , where the same characters keep crossing paths, intentionally or otherwise, and their conversations have the feel of something larger, representations of ideas and movements rather than only individuals' concerns. I have to admit the novel became challenging for me to follow at times, particularly without feeling on a visceral level exactly what was at stake in whether or not a Turkish woman chooses to wear a scarf or not. That is, while I can understand the intellectual debate that Pamuk is staging, it requires a bit of a leap of faith to feel its urgency, unlike. Crime and Punishment. , where the murder and the ensuing moral debates don't seem to depend on the same degree prior cultural background or knowledge. Or maybe they do, but in that case I have the prior knowledge. This book, while flawed, was nonetheless enjoyable for the bulk of the reading. There is a wonderful, lovely simplicity to the language, as if the very pages themselves are mirrors catching the snowflakes that flutter amidst nearly every scene.","Jun 26, 2007"
1503324,Rawley,"This should be required reading for western civilization, or at least for western politicians. Pamuk explains, as well as anyone, the complexities of the East/West divide. As a native of Istanbul, his entire life has toed the line between East and West, and therefor he has that unique perspective to see the issues from both sides that almost all of us lack.. Unlike ""The Black Book"" which in my opinion would appeal only to a native Turkish audience, ""Snow"" swept me away. The characters are fascinating and the plot is engrossing, from the very first chapter. The characters are simple, the conversations terse, the setting remote, the tone hushed, the pace slow, yet you will not be able to put this book down, and the complex issues it raises will linger in your mind and foster discussion.. In its examination of the East vs. West conflict, the book has perhaps perfect structure and balance. Pamuk doesn't take sides. You can literally take the six pointed snowflake diagram that Pamuk presents to catalog Ka's poems and instead put characters, or groups of characters, at opposite corners. Each Eastern character has his/her Western opposite. And each of these opposites is equally compelling, powerful, sympathetic, and persuasive.. Maybe instead of the word ""opposite"" I should use the word ""mirror"". One of Pamuk's chief insights is that the East and West are not necessarily in opposition--they essentially are striving for the same things. So, you end up with Eastern and Western characters who are more reflections of each other than oppositions.. So, after reading this book, I was left with an appreciation for just how deeply suspicious the East and West are of each other and also just how close this divide is to a common understanding. Pamuk takes a powerful step towards building this bridge with ""Snow"". He has said he'll never write another political novel. Hopefully enough people will read this one.","Sep 07, 2008"
105344879,Doris,"I have been reading for the second time this novel which I have dificulty in putting to paper. Why ?Because I am not creative , because the the sense of the wtitten word is beyond me . Because the writer has brought to the fore some subjects of importance that stand our crying out lo and behod! For the subject is immense, creation, silence, the power of the word, creation of the text, going through in life and deep down, its reflection on the imaginary level to the core of man's existence and above all to the exterior world, political situation reverberating on the individuals, these immediately concerned, those living in a town on the frontier of civilisations, Turk, Persian, Russian, Armenian, Kurd those coming there to help see the truth but also to help himself, Ka the central personage but also the friend of the narrator,the novelist, both of them literary men, trying to haunt their own demons, whether love, power of faith. And these are all concerned with identity in the modern world. How to be a man and intellectual, a poet an atheist or a religious man? What is the meaning of life, of existence? What is to be taken to possess to continue a fruitful and dignified existence in this contemporary world? What part is the best one? Plays, dialogues, miracles and story telling are executed throughout of the novel, theatre into the theatre, setting and times are changed, from different prospectives, swopping narrators, Ka , the poet, and his friend the narrator, prolongation of him, many prolongations in this novel of close friends whose identity become one, one taking form of life after the death of another like SF one of them has planned to publish, with love of woman at the core of identity process, like a story of the father and son, Rustem and Surhab. Two enemies or friends, adversaries but close and representing one posture of life are striving for the hand of a beautiful woman or land, two of them representing opposite of each other, the Other assuming possible interpretationo of the world., faith and non faith, past and present. . Terrorists. lovers and poets and that goes back on to Renaissance and even earlier to early days of civilisation, of solders on horse going on his task and at the same time creating the first word about his action of his engagement.. The writer Orhan Pamuk is a writer of deep interiorities, reflecting on the things read or said , delving into them looking at the snow and marvelling at the universe. Just like Hamlet, just like Ophelia in her madness , or Horatio, looking at her dead sister and marvelling at the existence. Just like Shakespeare who maybe played with his identity too, swopping it with Thomas Kyd. The novel is never finished just like life, with a post striptum in the present There is always someone to finish it in marvelling at the beauty and fascination of the subject and of the secret meaning of men's motives in the will to choose between the two paths, the past and the present? Which is the best? And how to prreserve one's identity without being rectionary? And all of them marvelling at the beauty of the universe symbolised by falling snowflakes being like man's existence, two of them resembling superficially to friends and adversaries in faith, love, artistic profession.. The novel I cannot finish for the second time because I have been reading another not present on GR but borrowed from a friend or acquaintance who is in Strasbourg like me with my companion. She has given me this book by her Croatian compatriot , the book entitled The Tears of the black Mulberry tree, by certain Izet Perviz who played on a macro cosmic time as one which is like wind or tempest or conflagration , which moves fast, in each moment of existent years taking them off implacably . The instance is only too transcient. Try as one might one cannot stop it because at the very next they a hundred and hundred million of light years away from the place we are.And again the narrator, or his conscience, is a man who masterd time, watch maker and watch reparer. Everything is transcient, living and continued living at some distant place where the implacable time has taken them into the depth of cosmos. What rests are the traces of memories, torn and uncomprehensible, like fools' gibberish, baby's babble, bird's chirping, lovers' sigh and cry in the exhaustion of satisfying act. From all life an eye can see three moments birth, puberty and death with accidents and flood , conflagrations and war. With joy, sardonic smiles and death and deep down a profound eye can discern a yearning and dolour at the secret and mystery if their existence. I am preoccupied with these novels Reading, rereading them to their ends, I marvel at the man dreaming,and sleeping being awake, thinking dreaming, somnolent or awake or drunk in his metamorphoses through life bungling through his or her existence. Like me, Man dreaming and reflecting. These novels are man response or rather his intuition on time in the calculation if his life, at the depth of its meaning Who Am I am therefore I exist but where is God, the creator In us, deep down Snow is just that sort of novel Poetic with crzing need of its author to engage in and says his experiences to his compatriots. And about religion and atheasm Only when you have reflected upon universe to the extent of experiencing revulsion can you grasp at the meaming of religiisity. But try as you might you need a long many yearsof thinking . A novelist in the digietic story didn-t have that outlet He died too young just at the moment where he intuitively saw difficulties in outcome, strongly personal. It is a novel about coming to consciousness.","Apr 28, 2020"
68030,Jenny (Reading Envy),"Ka, a poet exiled from Turkey, returns to his home country to write about a series of young girls who have been committing suicide in the city of Kars. At least, that is the reason given at the beginning. It gets more complicated once you find out that a woman he has loved also lives there, and is recently divorced.. I was interested in the story of Snow, and of the imagery (how snow masks violence, how snow can be isolating, the uniqueness of snowflakes - these are repeated themes). I was particularly interested in the poems, but the reader never gets to read them. While the narrative gives a good excuse in the end, I was unable to let go of my disappointment over being denied such a central element of the story. There are frequent comments about how poets separate themselves from what is going on, to preserve their hearts and to let the poems come to them through events, such as here:. ""Ka had explained to me that when a good poet is confronted with difficult facts that he knows to be true but also inimical to poetry, he has no choice but to flee to the margins; it was, he said, this very retreat that allowed him to hear the hidden music that is the source of all art."". But since we don't see inside of the poems, it suffices to separate the reader from Ka's true emotions and feelings about almost everything.. The other issue that interfered with my enjoyment of the story is the narrator. It is a friend of Ka's who is telling about Ka's journey, recreated through journals, newspaper articles, and interviews. This isn't immediately apparent, but isn't a spoiler to say so, I don't think. Because of this tactic though, it removes the reader even farther from the central emotion of the story. I had also guessed at one event that I suspect was supposed to be a great reveal, although the narrator frequently stumbles over himself to tell the juicy bits of a story, forcing him to go back and try to put it into context. Amusing, yes. Frustrating, also yes.. Another element I struggled with was the reaction to violence. The director of the Institute of Education is killed in front of Ka and Ipek, and while they leave the cafe rapidly, there isn't a sense of danger. Neither is there a sense of fear when people are killed by revolutionaries in public. That didn't seem true to life, and I think I'll blame the unreliable narrator. I get that Ka was putting his emotion into his poetry (which we never see), but what about everyone else living in Kars? Why go to a theater where there was violence at the last performance in that space, only to experience violence again? I will allow that I may not be reading between the lines enough, or that the narrator is glossing over the details most people would give. It made it very hard to connect to.. Other little bits on writing and poetry and happiness:. ""Only people who are very intelligent and very unhappy can write good poems. So you heroically undertook to endure the pains of faithlessness, just to be able to write good poems. But you didn't realize then that when you lost that voice inside you, you'd end up all alone in an empty universe."". ""But doesn't life make us unhappy?"". ""We do that to ourselves."". ""Only the purest poets allow love into their hearts in time of revolution.""","Jun 01, 2009"
2876105,Marc,"The setting of this novel is beautiful: Kars, a city in a remote corner of Turkey, with a glorious past but now rather marginal and gloomy, gets separated from the world by a snow blizzard and becomes the stage of some dramatic events during a couple of days. It reminded me of the city of Oran in Albert Camus' La Peste, and through the snow-parallel also of the Davos of Thomas Mann's Magic Mountain. Add to this that in Kars we see a famous Turkish poet wandering round, rather spineless undergoing events, and not coincidentally called Ka, making the parallel with Das Schloss by Franz Kafka very clear.. There's some action in this work (a military coup even, with lots of casualties), but it is primarily a ""talking""-novel. Pamuk zooms in on the almost endless Turkish discussions on the own identity (European or not?) and on the place of religion in society (Kemalism versus the rising Islamism). That requires some knowledge of Turkish affairs, certainly, but it is brought very interestingly, especially in the light of the islamophobia in the West after Nine-Eleven. The novel jumps from one discussion to another, each with varying participants, which requires some stamina of the reader, but it pays off. Admiringly Pamuk offers no simplicities, no caricatures, neither from the one nor from the other side. On the contrary, both atheists and islamists regularly express doubts about what they belief or stand for, both struggling with existential loneliness. The common thread throughout these disputations is the ambiguous attitude all protagonists have towards Europe, or the West: both attraction and repulsion; needless to say that the characters in this novel have lots of inferiority complexes, and thus this is very instructive.. With ""Snow"" Pamuk not only brings a very political novel, there is also a clear postmodernist side to it, with a reflection on what writing is and what meaning art can bring in the real world. After all, we see how Ka in Kars after years of creative drought suddenly pulls 19 poems from his sleeve. That way he can give everything he experiences its place. Moreover, there is the story of Ka himself, his wanderings between Kemalists and Islamists, his relationship with the stunning Ipek and the related hope and suffering. Pretty soon in the novel we get to know that this story is told by a friend of Ka, a fellow writer, but only at the end we become aware that this presumed objective narrator has filled in a large number of elements himself, especially about the inner life of Ka; this explains why the character of Ka makes such a volatile impression and regularly slides from one opinion to another.. So it really is clever how Pamuk succeeds in bringing all these layers together. Yet I am not totally overwhelmed: the verbosity of the novel sometimes is too high, some scenes are absurdly theatrical, the endless wanderings of Ka push the patience of the reader really to the limit and some elements have been worked out downright weak, such as Ka's puppy love for Ipek, the character of Ipek herself, just like the other female figures. Overall, this is definitely a great novel, but with some weak spots. I enjoyed reading this. (3.5 stars)","Dec 10, 2016"

Disappointed that what started out as a really interesting novel -- not to mention Nobel winner -- about political clashes between the European west and various political factions in Turkey (""Islamists"" versus ""secularists"" in the book), devolved into almost Faulkner-like stream-of-consciousness and dreamlike narration with dialogue that just wore me out... I have a hard time believing this group of sanctimonious teenagers really gets all whipped up about wearing headscarves as political statements anywhere in the Mideast these days.... But, OK whatever. I could suspended my disbelief but for trying to decipher the ridiculous conversations that make up the silly banter among all the characters.

This book is not just a novel, it is a like a magical combination of words, and with a style you feel is all unique to the writer.

1889855,Grace Tjan,"Come, come again whoever, whatever you may be. Heathen, fire-worshipper, sinful of idolatry, come. Come even if you broke your penitence a hundred times, come. Ours is not the portal of despair and misery, come.. Inscription on a wall at Rumi’s tomb, Konya, Turkey.. Something strange happened to me in Rumi’s tomb. I’m not sure if it was some kind of a spiritual experience, but there is definitely something spine-tinglingly eerie about it. Listening to the haunting Sufi music while gazing at the richly caparisoned tombs, which were covered with cloths embroidered with gilded Kufic inscriptions and topped with enormous turbans, gave me a sense of being in a portal to another world. I didn’t know anything about him, except that he was a famous Sufi poet, and that our bus tour stopped in Konya because his tomb complex, with its startlingly turquoise turret, was a must-see architectural jewel.. Perhaps the long bus ride from Istanbul and the hot midday sun made me light-headed and open to suggestive experiences. I still don’t know.. “I don’t like this place.” Someone spoke and startled me out of my reverie. It was Orhan, our Turkish guide.. “Why?” I asked him.. “No. Not the. Mevlana. . It’s this place, Konya. The people here are fanatics, I don’t like them.”. Reflexively, I looked around the tomb; there were surprisingly few visitors aside from our group --- women in black. chadors. that I was told were Iranians, other tourists, Western and Asian, and a few Turkish men in western clothing. Some seemed to be praying, but others merely gaped at the tombs and the marvelously intricate decorations on the mausoleum’s walls.. Orhan followed my gaze and said, “Do you know that they have tried to bomb this place several times?”. “But why? Isn’t the. Mevlana. a famous Muslim saint?”. “It’s because of this”, he pointed to the inscription on the wall. “The fanatics don’t like this so they want to destroy it. Come on, let’s get everyone back to the bus and get out of this place.”. Three days later, we were in Canakkale, in a hotel full of sunbathing German tourists with a glorious view of the sparkling Dardanelles. Orhan was chatting up a few scantily clad Frauleins. We seemed to be light years away from Konya and Turkey’s dusty Anatolian heartland. I wondered what the ‘fanatics’ that Orhan spoke about thought of this place, and how they could share the same country with their more secular fellow citizens.. Another Orhan, the Nobel Prize winner, tells us all about it in Snow.. The setting is Kars, a border city that seems to be perpetually swathed in swirling snow, where Islamists, army-backed secularists, Kurdish militants and leftists have been grimly battling for supremacy since Ataturk’s times. We follow Ka, an exiled poet who is sent to Kars to write an article about suicides among headscarf wearing girls, who are forbidden to attend state schools and universities unless they unveil themselves. In a short time, Ka witnesses a military coup, an assassination, a play that ends up in a massacre, and meets the individuals who represent the main opposing factions: Blue the charismatic Islamist/terrorist, and Sunay Zaim the actor/politician/staunch secularist. We may suppose that the westernized Ka’s sympathy naturally lies with the secularists, but no; he is apolitical; his real reason for coming to Kars is to see Ipek, a woman whom he has hopes for. Ipek, who recently divorced Muhtar, the leader of a local Islamist party, lives with her father and younger sister, Kadife. Kadife, to her secularist father’s consternation, is known as the leader of the headscarf girls --- and also secretly Blue’s lover. Soon, Ka is drawn into a vortex of torture and murderous violence, and political as well as personal reasons eventually compel him to choose sides.. Pamuk, who shares Ka’s westernized upbringing, presents the differing point of views even-handedly; all of the factions involved are equally dogmatic and violent. The Islamists kill in the name of religion, while the secularists do so in the name of the Turkish state. They both believe in a zero-sum game scenario in which even the slightest compromise is impossible. The result is a stark drama worthy of a Greek tragedy --- and indeed, the pivotal scenes of the story literally take place on the stage. The novel itself has a stagy quality; some of the dialogues feel like set pieces and some of the characters are barely three-dimensional. I occasionally found the insecure, ever doubtful Ka infuriating, especially in his pursuit of Ipek. Some sample dialogue:. Ka: “You’re here this evening, aren’t you?”. Ipek: “Yes.”. Ka: “Because I want to read you my poem again”.. Ka: “Do you think it’s beautiful?”. Ipek: “Yes, really, it’s beautiful.”. Ka: “What’s beautiful about it?”. Ipek: “I don’t know, it’s just beautiful”. Ka: “Did Muhtar ever read you a poem like this?”. Ipek: “Never.”. Ka began to read the poem aloud again, this time with growing force, but he still stopped at all the same places to ask, “Is it beautiful?” He also stopped at a few new places to say, “It really is very beautiful, isn’t it?”. Ipek: Yes, it’s very beautiful!”. Forget it, Ipek, you’ll never be happy with THIS guy.. The story ends with a murderous finale, also on stage. Without spoiling it, I must say that I didn’t find the rationale for the murder to be wholly believable.. I like how Pamuk subtly presents the issues in this book, which are important and unfortunately increasingly relevant to the lives of many people, both in the East and the West, but I don’t really care for the characters and how their stories are told. Pamuk never wholly convince me that these are real human beings instead of stage actors who must act the story. Otherwise, this shall be a solid 4 star book.","Aug 10, 2010"
2429525,Ajeng,"""when they write poems or sing songs in the West, they speak for all humanity. They're human beings -but we're just muslims. When we write something, it's just ethnic poetry."". The idea of the book is the confrontational fonts of east and west, of western secularist and the so-called political Islamist, a term I agree to since their Islamism is shown in the book as a political expression, not a spiritual one. In fact, the book does not speak about Islam as a faith per se, but as a symbol of resistance against oppression and ideas imposed on others.. For me, the obvious tone is how the ""west"", represented by Germany, the new land of the political exile Ka, seems to be the most righteous while Islam is an identity that needs constant struggle to justify its existence. This is a story of how a little town is stupor to the abuse it receives from all kinds of political figures (shootings and murders are tedious events for the residents of Kars); of how people are drowned in their own little existence and forgotten by the rest of the world.. In Kars, Islamic politics in the book is seen by the state as a barbaric movement of subversion. However, maybe they are that way precisely because they are being oppressed by the state in the first place. Can't you take refuge in the fact that your faith and religion is yours, and that only in your heart rests the fire that enlighten you? It's yours, punto! I supposed the more your existence is denied, the more it needs constant affirmation.. As a muslim reading this book I'm not shocked at all by how the Islamic politics is portrayed. This book is a caricature of how any concept (religion, jargons) is merely a vehicle for political and power ambitions. Be careful for people not familiar with Islam, this is not your guide to the actual (and sometimes shocking) diversity of the religion and its people.. The book for me comes down to one fascinating fact: that politics is merely a theatrical act (the aim is the performance), with its uselessness, pathetic collateral damages inflicted, and the absolute lack of substance for humanity.. -RN","Sep 10, 2011"

In his interview with 'The Paris Review', he revealed two important things about his writing method that an insightful reader will corroborate in any of his work: first, that he maps an entire novel-all its chapters, by their main content, before he begins writing them; and second, that he creates events within each chapter to make his characters. do. things that he wants them to. do. , to explore the questions that he wants explored. The supreme culmination of this technique is 'My Name is Red', which, according to this reviewer, seems to be. the masterpiece that Orhan will find impossible to surpass.. There are commonalities between 'My Name is Red' and 'Snow' that are too obvious to miss -- the hero, again, returns after 12 years of exile in search of an old love still resides in his heart, despite his having had numerous sexual experiences; the heroine, again, has had a previous husband and is unsure of her capacity to really love a new man; and the chief conflict, again, dribbles from Turkey's position as the bridge between Asia and Europe, between various religions, between conservatism and radicalism: components that get along perfectly at one time and are in an endless, solution-less ideological battle the very next. But these similarities do not really strike as something repetitive; instead, they warm one to the prospect of opening one's heart to another great book, putting one's trust even more in the virtuosity of the writer. That is a feat for which Orhan should pat his back.. In the first third, the novel promises so much -- laying bare, through the visit of Ka, a poet cum journalist returning from exile, the struggles of a contemporary Turkish society from the remote (close to Armenia), snowy town of Kars, and swerving questioningly along the axes of extreme and modern, Western and Eastern, religious and political -- that the farcical 'drama' that actually engenders the plot, appears nothing more than a chaotic thrust that the reader finds himself ill at ease with. This ill-managed, forced farce -- which repeats itself occasionally throughout the novel -- is perhaps the kind of experiment a writer in supreme confidence may be expected to undertake. If so, Pamuk failed here, setting a smoke throughout his laboratory; and I say this despite the fact that most of the novel is excellent, and I recommend it whole-heartedly to anyone interested in Pamuk's literary journey and/or Turkey's identity crisis.","Feb 07, 2011"
107172,Sandy or Eva,"An insipid hero in a desolate place covered by snow and political troubles in love with someone you just know he will never have a life with -- could be an interesting read, but Snow is not. I did read the whole thing and considered almost all the time I spent doing so a waste. What was the prize for because it could not have been for prose? Ka was someone I never cared about. And although Kars made for a very interesting background, it could not sustain this story.","Sep 15, 2007"

128820,Kate,"Even though it's clear from the stars above what my ultimate position is regarding this book, I'm going to try to be as balanced as I can, because I do believe this book has interesting ideas - but I give stars for how enjoyable a read the book was, and this was not an enjoyable read for me. In short, I'd only recommend this book if one is interested in Turkish politics or Turkish literature in general.. People in Turkey seem to be as divided on Pamuk himself as the goodreads reviewers are on ""Snow."" So, let's start with Pamuk. Some Turkish people (the haters) think that Pamuk is a novelist who wanted to ingratiate himself with the West, and did so by saying, very publicly in an interview with a Swiss newspaper, that yes, the Ottoman Empire was responsible for the deaths of millions of Armenians and Kurds. Several lawsuits in Turkey followed (because it was perceived as an attack on the Turkish state) and you can read all about how the charges were eventually dropped in Wikipedia. Others, and especially Western folks, applauded Pamuk for standing up for freedom of speech in a country where this “inalienable right” is not well recognized at all. I honestly don’t know what to think about Pamuk the author, because although his actions are commendable, there is also a history of Orientalism (which I won't get into here) that complicates this scenario and does not make it as straightforward as it seems. Let me just say that it does merit further research into Turkish history and the current political climate.. Now to the book, which is actually deeply concerned with the kinds of political issues that Pamuk himself was concerned with when he made that statement, and a note on the style: the book was almost embarrassing for me to read. It was so full of prose that was not only self-deprecating, but also reaching out pathetically to the reader for pity. I imagined it to be a hungry dog following me down the street, imploring me for food yet knowing that I wouldn't give any… and in knowing this also making his plea more persistent, more pitiful. And what I did right there – narrating every single thing the reader of that sentence should think – is also what Pamuk does throughout the entire novel. It’s absolutely tiring to read sentences like that one after another after another – and moreover, it’s a little insulting. Let the reader have a go at finding the meaning in what is written. Then again, sure, perhaps one can merely call this a stylistic difference. Maybe I’m more interested in authors who write less and say more. But, you see… the problems continue. I can’t stress enough that if Ka (the main character, a poet) looked at the snow falling in Kars and felt God inside himself one more time, I’d have ripped the book in half. Ka is an extremely distasteful character to me – and, it seems, not wholly by the author’s design. His very name comes from the fact that he did not like the name his parents gave him, and so he took his first and last initial, and used that as his poetic sobriquet. This cliché hit me in the face like a sack full of bricks. There is always, though, the possibility that the author is using a cliché in an ironic way – but judging from the tone of the book as a whole, and from another one of his books I’ve read (“Istanbul: Memoirs of a City”), the evidence pushes me more towards believing that the author is at least partially naïve to the clichés he creates – or at least, the irony is not handled in a subtle way, and runs away from him.. A troubling aspect about the book is the way in which women are depicted. Ipek, Ka’s love interest, summarizes her own character towards the end of the novel when she says, “I tried to love Muhtar, but it didn’t work out. I loved Blue with all my heart, but it didn’t work out. I believed I would learn to love Ka, but that didn’t work out, either…” (p. 429) It seems that Ipek can be summarized in a series of unfulfilling love affairs and her unbelievable beauty. And Ipek was, of course, the cure to Ka’s poetic unhappiness, because she is beautiful, and because she will make him happy if he possesses her. Pamuk here perpetuates a masculine romantic myth that is directly opposed to his forward-thinking political ideas. Kadife, Ipek’s less-beautiful but more fiery, headscarved sister, begins as an intriguing and mysterious character, and ends as a former shadow of her opinionated self. After she does some time, she ends up marrying another character in the book and has a baby, and generally just shuts up and ""settles down."" Orhan, who is the narrator and also a character in the book, says, “I decided that prison had been good for Kadife; she was more mature now, more assured.” (p. 429) It is also telling that Kadife says only one or two unimportant things at the end of the book; she is not even allowed to give her own impression of her time in prison and her life afterwards.. In the end, many of my issues with this novel can be summed up by saying that Pamuk cannot keep himself out of the book – by which I'm not only referring to how he is an actual character in the book. Somehow, his ego rises up from each chapter, and his great desire to be profound is painfully apparent, and ends up falling flat. This is extremely disappointing, because there are many wonderful and complex themes in the book that are ruined through Pamuk’s desire to also be present within them. And, what’s more, he has written differently in the past. His earlier novel, “My Name is Red,” is a great book, and well worth reading. But it is such a book partly because Pamuk the author is not present within it.. So, even if the execution is, in my opinion, lacking, Pamuk certainly has many interesting ways of portraying the political situation in Turkey. The Armenian mansions which stand dilapidated and unused are a ghostly reminder of Turkey’s past. The revolution in Kars, which starts as a theatrical performance, is a thought-provoking and apt representation of the history of military coups in Turkey. The paranoia of the Turkish military concerning Kurdish terrorist plots is great satire, as is his portrayal of Blue, the Islamic fundamentalist, in his affairs and his hunger for power and fame. And then there is one scene in which the heads of different factions or groups in Turkey gather together to sign a secret proclamation denouncing the coup, to be sent to a (fictitious) German newspaper editor, and it makes the book. The chaos, the inconsistencies, the arbitrariness of the meeting all come together to form a bitter but realistic picture of Turkey’s political struggles, and it is this scene which represents what “Snow” could have been, but falls short of.","Sep 07, 2011"

40889078,Rado Baťo,"A wonderful sketch of Turkish politics by the country's most gifted narrator. If you've ever been confused and curious about the recent development in Turkey,. Snow. is a good place to start. You won't get detailed hard facts about its colorful political past and present, but you will be blessed with something even more valuable. Pamuk offers you an opportunity to catch a glimpse of Turkish political heart and soul - something you can't distill from the news or wikipedia. No, I don't ""understand"" Turkey better by merely reading one novel, that would be a stupid thing to say. But I hope next time I'll read the news about new disturbing development of present-day Erdogan regime, there is a better chance I won't look at it with helplessly ignorant Western eyes.. Pamuk covers virtually all important milestones of Turkish politics in 20th century. Sometimes with a brutal honesty and a wonderful sarcasm. “Unlike westernized Turks, they don’t instinctively despise common people,” says one of the book characters about political Islamists, echoing larger conflict between westernized secular elite and religious poor. “(If) Germany opened a consulate in Kars today and started handing out free visas, the city would be empty within a week,” snaps another character back at anti-Western propaganda of political Islam. This kind of hilarious mocking escalates in a scene where all sort of antiestablishment activists try to write an open letter against staged military coup in the city of Kars for German newspaper. Priceless.. On a more serious note, it hurts to watch the nostalgia the hero of the book — an exiled westernized poet Ka — feels about the fate of modernization in his homeland. Secularism forced on country under the loaded guns of army soldiers is dying project in Pamuk’s book, with signs of decay and anger visible everywhere in the streets of age-old town of Kars. “In the late forties, they’d had to search the whole city for a black scarf to use in the play… Now the streets of Kars are filled with young women in head scarves of every kind.” The power of the secularists in Turkey comes from the army. This destroys Turkey’s democracy and culture of tolerance, said Pamuk in one of the interviews. Also it has created a political system, democratic on the surface, but damaged by it’s own kinds of Orwellian twists.","Oct 19, 2016"
143274,Cecilia Baader,"""The third act began with Funda Eser singing a folk song about a woman who'd been raped, an engaging number to make up for earlier parts of the drama that the audience had found too intellectual or otherwise obscure."" And so with a single sentence Pamuk explains his novel. Snow. , last year's Nobel Prize winner.. Snow. centers on a Turkish poet who returns to his homeland to write an article about the girls who keep committing suicide in Kars, an isolated village far from Istanbul.. Kars is experiencing what most of the Muslim nations of the world are fighting -- how to reconcile governing a secular land where the fundamentalists think nothing of murdering a man. In this case, a man's decision not to allow girls who wear the head scarf to attend school is so far-reaching that it sets off first his own murder and a revolution, for the headscarf girls are killing themselves, and the religious boys worship them for it. As their martyrdom grows, the secularists stage a bloody revolution and the real drama begins. For, in the midst of that revolution, a poet who has been unable to write can write again, fall in love with a beautiful woman, and become a major player on the revolution's stage, both literally and figuratively.. Snow. is often ponderous reading, but Pamuk is slyly funny at moments, sometimes describing incidents that, like Funda Eser's song, cater to the low element who only wants to know about sex and bloodshed, but also making wise observations about the nature of humankind. If we read novels to learn about the condition of ourselves, Pamuk teaches us that we are liars who will revel in the lowest elements in society, seeking only to fulfill our secret pleasures.. He is, I fear, right.","Jun 25, 2007"
728551,Erin,"Quotes:. ""Immersed as he was in the dusky melancholy that had begun descending over the city, he still felt happy. A long procession of images paraded before his eyes as he awaited his next poem - a waking dream of ugly unadorned concrete buildings, parking lots buried in snow, teahouses and barbershops and grocery stores all hidden behind their icy windows, courtyards in which dogs had been barking in unison since the days of he Russians, stores selling spare parts for tractors alongside horse-drawn carriage supplies and cheese. He was seized by the certainty that everything he saw - the banners for the Motherland Party, the little window hidden behind those tightly drawn curtains, the slip of paper someone had taped to the icy window of the Knowledge Pharmacy months earlier to announce that the shot for Japanese influenza had finally arrived, the yellow antisuicide poster - every last one of these details would stay with him for the rest of his life. There arose from these minor things a vision of extraordinary power: so certain was he that 'everything on earth is interconnected and I too am inextricably linked to this deep and beautiful world,' he could only conclude another poem was on its way, and so he stepped inside one of the teahouses on Ataturk Avenue.

2661376,نزار شهاب الدين,"I read this novel as an e-book, mostly on my mobile and mostly during the short waiting times in a traffic light, a shop queue, or the like. This, normally, caused it to take long reading, but contrary to what would be expected, didn't cause its flame to flicker. The author managed to keep me grabbed to it and longing for the next waiting time. The last few chapters forced me to finish them under the toughest load of other critical tasks. Pamuk has a very nice style of spontaneous writing and he is in close touch with the human psyche. I have some reservations of course on his stand, or rather his expression, of the Islamic viewpoint of things, but artistically I give it to him that he is talented. I am not so sure yet whether the novel was based on true events or this was some clever verisimilitude from Pamuk's side. In both cases, the events are touching and so humanistic, but if they were real, one would really feel sorry for some of the main characters, especially Ka. Moreover, one would have wished to read Ka's poetry, as Pamuk succeeded in stoking our excitement about them, and would, at the same time, feel sorry for their loss.. Personally, I tend to believe it's a technical trick from Pamuk to give his events a realistic aura and hence deepen their emotional effect and deliver his message more thoroughly.","Mar 19, 2010"
2330809,Steve,"I am SO glad I FINALLY finished this book. That's only partially true. I'm just glad it's over. In retrospect, I should have given up. No, when I stopped reading it the first time, I should never have started again.... (I think I started and finished at least six, maybe eight books since I first started this one.... I can't think of another book that I've carried on more airplanes, to more cities, nay, more countries, than this one.... It became a yoke around my neck, a literal burden in my backpack....). But people told me it was terrific. (OK, I will disregard their recommendations in the future.) And it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. (But that should have set off the warning bells.... OK, in all fairness, I've only read two dozen Pulitzer Prize winners, and while some were wonderful, many more have been disappointments....). OK, I admit that I probably just failed to understand this book. If it was supposed to be funny, I didn't get the joke(s). If I was supposed to feel sorry for the protagonist or any of the main characters, I didn't. If I was supposed to care about anyone in - or for that matter - anything about the story, I didn't.. I don't think I'm immune to literature, nor do I have an inflexible cultural tin ear. But whatever made this book work for so many people didn't reach out and touch me.... Alas.","Jul 24, 2011"

1746401,Friederike Knabe,"I read this novel back in 2005. Here are my thoughts of it then that still have meaning for me now.. Novels like Pamuk’s ""Snow"" can be understood at different levels. Consider it as pure entertainment; for the political intrigue and thrill; or as a virtual door into a foreign place, the lives of far away people, their time or preoccupations.. Pamuk has attempted to present us with all three options in one. The reader is exposed to a panoramic view of Turkey’s political and religious conflicts and ethnic tensions. His multitude of characters represents every conceivable strand of Turkish society: Atatürk secularism and pro-European modernism on the one hand and various religious factions of Muslim faith on the other. By compressing the events into one locale, a remote, poor and backward town, Kars, in Eastern Turkey, he creates a charged playing field. A major snowstorm has cut off the access roads to the town, bringing the conflicting positions to boiling point.... Within this complex political turmoil, wanders Ka, the protagonist of the story. A recently unproductive poet, he returned from Germany to attend his mother’s funeral. Presenting himself as a journalist, he claims to be interested in the headline story: the headscarf girls’ suicides. On a personal level, he wants to find a “Turkish girl” to marry and take back to Germany.. The story is told by Orhan, a close friend of Ka, four years after the events in Kars. In many ways he describes Ka as a somewhat confused, middle-aged man, whose exposure to the realities of Kars result in his questioning his life so far. He is taking in all political and religious positions, getting increasingly entangled as events unfold.. Pamuk himself described “Snow” as a political novel. Is it convincing in that ambition? For the reader who is not that familiar with Turkey or its language, it is difficult to judge its value in this category. My own interpretation is that Pamuk created a satire on Turkey and its historical and present-day problems. The exaggeration in the description of Kars, political intrigues, religious fanaticism, military brutality, and Ka’s own personality would lead to that assessment. My overall impression is that of a strange mix of over-detailed realistic? reporting on events and circumstances in Kars during a snow storm and very generalized, almost philosophical commentary on love, poetry, happiness in which the character Ka is embedded.","Jan 15, 2013"
217922,Saxon,"I heard alot about Pamuk. He seems to be gracing the A&C sections of all the periodicals that I frequently read. This has sparked an interest in him for quite some time now. This is the first novel that I have read of his, Snow was assigned for my Novel on the Globe course.. Unfortunately, Snow proved slightly disappointing. After a lengthy in-class discussion, I pinpointed my troubles with the novel down the three main things that can be easily summed up:. *way too episodic and often times feeling like a soap opera.. *poor character development. The book consist of alot of characters and lot of dialogue all which about half way through the book starts to blend together. Differentiating between the characters becomes difficult and they all begin to feel like they lack characteristics to make them unique. Its actually pretty amazing that with a novel that is almost 500 pages that character development lacks. What the hell else where you writing about?. *employment of cheap tactics to keep reader interested. The first half of the book is like a cheap detective novel. I feel almost offended that Pamuk felt the necessity to employ such blatant and overt tools as an attempt to keep me turning pages.. Other than that the book does contain some good elements touching on the extremes of both devout state-sponsored secularism and the violent actions of fanatical islamists. He also plays with theme of time which adds an interesting element to the narrative overall.. I would like to read something else by him...but this didnt encourage me too much.","Nov 06, 2007"
1076079,☮Karen,"Not a quick read, not an easy read. Parts are very enjoyable and thought provoking, but some parts drag on and on, as the main character Ka, a poet, travels from his home in Germany to his motherland Turkey to research why young women are killing themselves over a new law the govt has imposed banning head scarves on females. Mostly he is going to see a woman he once was in love with, a beautiful divorcee, to try to convince her to marry him and come back to Frankfurt with him. This alone explains how illogical this guy is--he seems to live in a dreamland with unreasonable expectations and thoughts.. The story takes place in a 3-day snowstorm that causes the city of Kars to be cut off from the rest of the world. So much happens during this 3 day period, it seems more like 3 weeks. And the whole time, it is snowing, snowing, snowing. Ka, an atheist poet, hasn't written a poem in years, but the snow and the political upheaval occuring inspire him to write 19 poems in 3 days, to publish in a new book called Snow. Not one of these poems is shared with the reader, which was very frustrating.. I would recommend this book only because nothing else has ever explained to me so well the religious fanatacism, the factions and their opinions of the West (US), and why those women choose so adamantly to keep themselves covered up in varying degrees.","Oct 09, 2010"

The use of primary colors across Pamuk's oeuvre is intriguing -. The White Castle. ,. The Black Book. ,. My Name Is Red. and the significant character called Blue in this one - the latter a well-spoken radical Islamist who feels impelled to violent means.. The Turkish title of this is. Kar. which (Anglicized to ""Kars"" for some reason) is the name of the decrepit provincial city in which it takes place - I spent a stray minute or two wondering what American city could be faintly analogous - Louisville?

A snowstorm isolates the town for days and the religious/political/establishment/rebel dramas can play out while the minor celebrity poet rediscovers his muse. I understand some of the region's issues much better now, but the novel didn't quite deliver the punch it promised - as if the snow deadened the effects.

1257629,Karl-O,"I have found the characters in Snow to be somewhat lacking in depth. However, as I finished reading I got to the realization that this may be precisely why the book works. A feature and not a bug, if you know what I mean.. In exchange for the lost depth, Pamuk creats a novel where it is ideas and themes that are in constant debate and struggle with one another. Turkishness vs. The West (whatever that means*). Collectivism vs. individualism (again whatever that means). A secular Turkey vs. an Islamism one. Happiness vs. integrity. Fear vs. Security.. While the drama in the story (which I really found to be well-crafted) play out on the page, Pamuk examines each of these ideas in depth, and showcases their strengths and weaknesses, and what they mean for the people of Turkey. Not necessarily the middle-class westernized Istambulites who Europeans like and approve of, and who Pamuk himself hails from, but the impoverished people of the Turkey outside the Janus-faced city.. The book is meant to be a reconstruction of the event in the life of an (until-recently) exiled poet called Ka. Ka arrived recently from Germany to the city of Kars in eastern Turkey right on the border with Armenia**. He is there to examine instances of suicide among girls banned from wearing headscarves by their families and the state. He spends three eventful days in Kars meeting a slew of characters and engaging in conversations that are not so much about their content but the tensions they highlight. And of course, there is a girl who Ka intends to take with him back to Germany, and to share a normal and happy life with there.. The narrator Orhan, is writing the novel using letters and notes of Ka written months and years after the events they document. And in addition to the feature I mention above of characters yielding their place in the drama to ideas, the after-the-fact reconstruction gives the story a fairy tale like glow, mirroring the city of Kars which is being page-by-page submerged under snow. As the book unfolds, it becomes clear that despite appearances, Ka is in a single-minded pursuit for his personal happiness, which he will pay very dearly for just to see it shatter in front of his eyes.. *Pamuk shows very cleverly the different meanings of the term ""West"" or ""Individualism"" depending on who you ask, even from the same group (e.g. Islamists). **There is quite a few mentions of Armenians, but little courage to confront the history of the early 20th century events.

Ka, the poet; Ka the disillusioned leftist activist living in self-imposed exile in Germany, Ka the writer born Kerim Alakuşoğlu (known to all as Ka) visits the eastern city of Kars, sent on assignment by his friends at a republican paper in Istanbul, to explore a spate of suicides by young women and report on the seeming certain election victory by an Islamist party. Ka’s personal mission is to locate his former university friend İpek, who he is convinced will become his wife/lover and with whom he will find the happiness that has long eluded him. It has all the aspects we’d expect of a quest – dreams of a single solution, danger, the potential for tragedy, challenge along the way. It has the homonymic place – Ka in Kars – and an off-kilter setting; it is not just the single set of traffic lights that makes Ka resemble Twin Peaks.. At the heart of the quest is a political fable, a story of decisive political action that is little more than (or only) a theatrical moment in a closed environment, that seems more than anything else to tease out the fragility of fundamentalisms of all kinds, from republicans stuck in their vision of a Turkey they fix in Ataturk’s 1920s and Islamists whose fundamentalism is not so much inspired by the Koran and hadith as it is, for some, in their doubt and the dreams the interaction of doubt and faith inspire. Pamuk draws on two writerly forms to grant this novel its quest-like form; the intense detail that emerges as Ka’s concurrent notetaking, despite the 3rd person form, and the intermittent breaking of the 4th wall to reveal the writer/narrator, Orhan Bey, whose presence gradually reveals it to be not a quest but a tragedy.. Pamuk is a deft writer who manages several subtle aspects to the novel: despite his secular liberal outlook many of his Islamist characters are much more nuanced than his republicans. In part this may be because most of the republicans are associated with the State – with the exception of Turgut Bey, İpek’s father, an old school leftist and father of Kadife, widely seen as leader of the ‘headscarf girls’ whose resolution he admires while disagreeing with her politics. Pamuk also manages the voices of the women characters extremely well – especially İpek and Kadife whose constant dialogues with each other and Ka come close to making them the driving forces of the story despite Ka occupying the narrative role of ‘hero’.. Pamuk’s Kars is a slightly bizarre town of displaced Kurds in their own territory, of a newspaper publisher who publishes today’s news yesterday – stories in the past tense of what will happen tomorrow, of a town where nearly everyone seems to be an informer, a spy or a detective but whom it is, at times, easy to avoid, of an actor whose coup is both real and pure theatre and of an architecture that tells north eastern Turkey’s complex history as palimpsest of Russian, Armenian, Kurdish and Turkish occupation and dominance. Yet amid all the fragility of its ideologies there is a deep and profound attachment to place with a loyalty to its people – as we see in İpek’s final decisions.. This is, however, not a snappy and quick read – Pamuk may be an elegant writer but he is also demanding; we need to pay close attention to the twists and turns of the tale that, for me, made much more sense when I began to conceive of it as an odyssey with elements of a classical format of quest and opposition, of uncontrollable and incomprehensible forces that distract the outsider from his goal and risk undermining his ultimate goal. There is a level of detail alongside a sameness in much of Kars’ shabbiness that mirrors Ka’s dislocation and his seeming mystification at what is going on around him – to the extent he often seems a pawn in events that he barely understands but that both İpek and Kadife comprehend in way that only outsiders who have become embedded can.. In the end it reveals itself as a rich, beautiful and elegant tale of location and dislocation, of loyalty, loss, belief and the importance of doubt and just a little scepticism as well as the dangers of presumption.","Mar 12, 2014"
1478144,John,"I know this must be a good novel because all kinds of people tell me so in the reviews quoted in the book's prelims, because it featured on a stack of newspapers' Best Books of the Year lists, because on the back cover John Updike raves about it and predicts its author as a future Nobel winner, and because since the publication of my copy the author has indeed gone on to win the Nobel Literature Prize, but . . .. I found it unbelievably hard going, and made it through to the end as an exercise of sheer stubbornness.. A Poet (I capitalize deliberately) called Ka, in exile in Frankfurt these past few years, returns to his somewhat backward hometown of Kars in Turkey. His ostensible reason for the visit is to write a newspaper story on a wave of suicides committed by young women in defense of their right to wear headscarves, as prescribed by Islam; in fact, he wants to woo the lovely Ipek, whom he's fancied since college days and who is now divorced from her husband. As he arrives in Kars there's a blizzard, and for the next few days the town is cut off by snow from the outside world. During those days an itinerant acting troupe and the military launch a bloody crackdown on the town's politically active religious factions, and Ka finds himself used as a tool by all parties. He also finds that, for the first time in years, he's compulsively writing Poetry, and he does succeed in seducing Ipek. It's as if, imprisoned by the snowdrifts, Kars is a microcosm of Turkey and Ka's few days there a microcosm of a human life.. All of which sounds promising and explains why I read the book . . . despite all those rave reviews. An added factor was that I realized, shame on me, I'd never read a Turkish novel before despite having a Turkish nephew-in-law.. If. Snow. is representative, alas, I may never read. another. Turkish novel. The tale has almost no characterization, which makes it difficult to become involved in the events; the sole characters who evoked a flicker of interest in me -- and it was no more than a flicker -- were Ipek's sister Kadife and a religious fanatic called Blue, plus the author himself, who narrates and who eventually enters the story. (About Ipek, who you'd have thought might be something of a focus of the novel, bearing in mind Ka's obsession with her, we learn little except that she's knockout beautiful and has ""really enormous"" breasts.) Just about every event seems grossly overwritten, as if nothing can happen without tedious qualification and/or dithering on the part of the protagonists; the result was that I began to dread the heralding of any new piece of action because I knew I'd have to wade through a quagmire of turgid prose to get there.. An important strand of the book comprises discussions between the various characters of issues concerning secularism/atheism and religion, at both the political and personal levels. Again, on the face of it, this might have sounded promising to me: I. enjoy. philosophical engagements of this kind in my fiction reading. But the arguments on both sides in. Snow. seemed to me no more than paltry and adolescent: if no one could come up with better advocacy on this for their differing worldviews,. none. of them deserved to win.. I've tried not to let my opinion of. Snow. be colored by the fact that the font in this edition is miserably small; it's also in a typeface that I've had difficulty with before because for some reason the semicolons tend to disappear or look like commas as I'm reading -- in other words, I kept having to go back and reparse sentences. If I'd been enjoying the book a bit more (well, really quite a lot more) I might have thought to invest in an ebook version so I could blow the typography up a tad; as it was, this'd have seemed like throwing good money after bad.. Yet, as noted, plenty of people far more distinguished than I am have clearly thought. Snow. to be the bee's knees, the cat's pajamas and, for all I know, Ipek's really enormous breasts. As for me, though . . .","Mar 20, 2018"
2168708,Marta,"A very complex novel, with many layers, about the pain an exhiliration of love, a small town torn by religious and political divide, its proventiality and pride, its being caught between east and west; police brutality, fear, theater, head scarves, suicide, innocence and corruption. Mesmerizing, rich in detail, empathy and close observation of humans, their beliefs, their gestures. All the while the snow keeps falling, enveloping the town of Ka, the tragedy and the mystery in poetic magic.. Pamuk’s writing evokes Dostoyevsky in its dialogs and Tolstoy in its observation of people; Thomas Mann’s description of places; Garcia Marquez’s magical realism in the relationships of people in the town. An extremely gifted writer, a modern classicist, who brings back the best traditions of the old masters yet makes it his own.","Feb 09, 2018"
3333943,Judy,"My accomplishment is making it all the way through a novel by Orhan Pamuk, the Turkish writer who was awarded the Novel Prize for Literature in 2006. I didn't love it completely but I loved things about it.. Pamuk is the Naguib Mahfouz of Turkey. He writes for his countrymen (who don't appreciate him) and for the rest of the world. He tells us about Turkey, both its history and its present. Such a long, turbulent history, and like Egypt it was at the center of world events for a long time. Many different peoples, religions, and political views accompany the nation's awkward progression into the modern world.. Much of that progression can be found in. Snow. , seen through the eyes of Ka, a poet, and through various characters from the impoverished and forgotten town of Kars. Ka was raised in Istanbul amidst middle class comforts, as was Pamuk. His youthful political efforts and writitngs earned him exile in Germany but in the novel Ka has returned to Turkey for his mother's funeral.. On a whim, he travels to Kars. It is the dead of winter so he arrives just as a blizzard has closed all roads. Soon he is caught up in personal, political, and religious conflicts because he funded his trip by agreeing to write an article about a recent rash of suicides by Muslim girls who were made to remove the veil. Within the first day he falls in love with the beautiful Ipek. Then he is approached by Blue, the terrorist of the region. As he goes around the town, seeking interviews, religious aspirations and doubts are reawakened but most of all, he breaks out of years of writer's block and begins to write poetry again.. In a combination of literary, melodramatic, and comedic writing, Pamuk drew me into the lives of these very foreign people. I loved the insight into how a poem is written. The love affair between Ka and Ipek is more like a soap opera, showing me that no matter the culture men and women can become fools for love. The suspense builds as Ka digs himself deeper and deeper into the political intrigues of the town until I wondered if he would get out alive.. About two thirds into the novel, the author tells his readers that Ka does return to Germany and meets his doom there but somehow this news does not allay the suspense. I would have to read the book again to figure out how he did that.. Snow. was named one of the best books of the year by no less than nine major book review sections, including the New York Times. I agree that it is a feat of literature but possibly has a limited readership. It is a challenging and confusing read at times with a distinctly Middle Eastern tone. I felt rewarded by the reading experience because it is a look into people and places so different from what I know and yet so similar in their humanity.","Sep 15, 2013"
1407856,Atalay,"It has been a long time since I read Snow. I think it was just after its first publication in 2002. I am a great fan of Pamuk. I have started to read it again after reading Mackie's comments on Pamuk. Mackie says that most of his colleagues and students in İzmir Turkey did not like Pamuk or his novels. They think that Pamuk is an Orientalist and represent Turkey just the way the Westerners would wish to see. I really doubt that. And then there was Zonana's question to Mackie ""What book would represent Turkey well?"" It is hard to answer that question. I would suggest Nazım Hikmet's Human Landscapes from My Country as a start. But again many Turkish people will oppose my idea of recommending Hikmet's work as representative of Turkish soul.. Snow again. I read th first two chapters in the morning. I have been trying to understand why he has been so hated by so many in Turkey, yet I have to remind you that there are also a considerable number of his fans also. When Pamuk was asked to edit Turkish daily Radikal what he did was to take his revenge from daily Cumhuriyet, Republic. His headline was what Republic had written on Hikmet when he fled Turkey. Although Republic now seems to be a great promoter of Hikmet in 1950s it had a different line. Pamuk implied that Republic has had an hostile attitude towards controversial poets and writers. Most Kemalists would hate Pamuk for, I cannot find and show it to you but as they claim, Pamuk refers to Mustfa Kemal Ataturk, the commander of Turkish Independence war and the founder of modern Turkey, as the Sultan, the padishah whose job was to scare crows, referring to story about Atatürk's early childhood story. According to that story which is known by all the primary school students in Turkey, when Atatürk's father died when he was a little boy he had to spend some time at his uncle's farm for some time. There he scared crows from the fields to protect the crop. The Kemalists were furious. According to them that allusion was an offence of unforgivable type.. Then in Snow he gives voice to İslamist women blaming the state and Kemalists of taking part in the suicides of the girls. As far a I remember Pamuk accuses Kemalists for dealing with things like turban, headcover instead of trying to improve the lives of those girls who commit suicides. I would like to know more about Turkish femminists's response to Snow. As one of the main themes of Snow is the women.. On the other hand, there are still structures of feelings which are neglected. Why do the men treat women so badly? What are the traditions and the logic behind all that, how do they justify their behaviour, traditions, discourse, culture...","Aug 08, 2008"
18289388,Margaret Carmel,"Although I did not care for Orhan Pamuk's book My Name is Red, I decided to give this author another shot because he is so highly acclaimed and I am interested in the Middle East. Unfortunately, Pamuk disappointed me in Snow as much before.. For the first 150 pages or so, this story of a Turkish ex-pat living in Germany traveling to the far reaches of Anatolia to do some freelance reporting on a rash of suicides of young Muslim women and the upcoming elections was engaging. But soon, this book's overly long style and the narrator grated on my nerves.. While I think this book (just like My Name is Red) does a great job of posing interesting questions to the reader about Turkey's constant internal struggle between East and West, the plot here was lacking. In the beginning, Ka wandering the city and meeting people for his story worked, but once he got caught up with meeting various characters, being followed by police, and the constant parade of needlessly long conversations with random people he met on the street everything got bogged down. Pamuk also did not close any of the narrative loops he began in the beginning of the story regarding Ka's reporting or the rash of suicides, so the plot just felt meandering and somewhat aimless.. Another issue I have with this book is Ka himself. Just like in My Name is Red, the main male character was a whiny dude who almost instantly fell in love with a woman and bemoaned that they could not be together. The way Ka was helplessly in love with Ipek felt childish. ESPECIALLY in one particular scene where he read a poem of his to her multiple times and fished for compliments. Most of their dialogue I was rolling my eyes because of how juvenile he sounded.. Finally, this book is about a poet and there are no poems in this book. I realize that the author put in an explanation for this, but it still felt annoying to hear about how good these poems were the entire book and never get to read them.. I'm disappointed that I didn't like this. At this point, I would be reluctant to pick up another book by this author.","Sep 21, 2017"
2827530,Mimi (a.k.a Ellen),"Another Obscure Nobel Prize Winner. While I did feel the author conveyed the desperation of cultures dealing with a population divided over modernization and fundamentalism, I felt, in general, this book was ill conceived. The characters are one dimensional and wooden. For example, Ka is obsessed with a woman from his past because she is beautiful, as he continually reminds us, ad nauseum: although they haven't seen each other for years, and she is married to someone else, within hours of reconnecting with her, he asks her to run away with him. He witnesses a shooting in a cafe, and never reacts to it, leaves the man to die, and never reports it? Are we to take a protagonist such as this seriously?. While the author sets up scenarios where people discuss the benefits/deficits of westernizing, the sequences are extremely long, drawn out, and the characters never make clear points. The premise of Ka's going to report on the suicides of several girls forced to go to school without being allowed to wear their headscarves was great, but the theme was never developed, deconstructed, or resolved.. I think this is a typical case of a writer who is so obscure that the Nobel committee gives them a prize, perhaps, thinking the disorganization and poor storytelling skills signify genius (i.e., if you don't ""get"" it, you obviously don't belong in the ""club."")","Nov 17, 2009"
51864,Danielle,"Interesting read.. fits and starts... disappointing.. the flowery language seemed unnecessary and got in the way of the narrative.. I did not enjoy the change in perspective about 3/4 through, from third person omniscient to first person. This could have been done a lot more smoothly.. This book had 2 or 3 things going for it. The story really is interesting, if you can get past some of the silliness. Ka has something to say, if you can get past his naivete and narrow-mindedness. And there are some really interesting literary devices used, sometimes I would read a passage and then a few hours later I would realize what the author was doing. I noticed a lot of parallels between Ka's poetry, the theatrical revolution, and this book itself. There's an unfolding puzzle here, if you pay attention, and I appreciate that. I also appreciated learning about Turkey, and found the story interesting as a cultural/political lesson.. But overall, I didn't really enjoy it. I can't believe this won the nobel prize in literature.. Still, if you're curious, you can put up with some literary shenanigans, and you have a high tolerance for boredom you might find this worth reading.","Mar 04, 2008"
9852577,Eszter Faatima Sabiq,"At first I was very enthusiastic and excited- a contemporary novel about an Islamic society with fresh ideas and a dash of magic realism maybe. I do not remember the exact page, but around halfway into the book I realised how forced all the story is, how unrealistic the characters are, how much it fails in adding any new ideas to the discourse about hijab or the differences between East and West and the problems those face who were brought up in the East and live in the West. I grew angry and suffered all through to the end partly because I did not want to abandon it unread, and partly because I was hoping for something good to come out of it eventually- but in vain. By the time I finished, I hated and despised most of the main characters and was wondering if it is possible that the Turks drink more than the Russians (which I doubt). If I was a Turk, I would be probably much more disappointed and angry. There are some nice sentences in it of course, but it was not worth the bother for them.","Feb 13, 2013"

The main character has no backbone, he's self-involved and seems oblivious to the events going on around him (even when there's armed conflict and torture.). It's as if the characters are on a stage declaiming their lines. The presence of the other characters is irrelevant..

3699250,Corey,"My predominant feeling about this book was… impatience. Honestly, I’m sick of fundamentalism. I’m sick of what a large role it pays in my life – from the daily news that I read online (recent incidents include the Boston Marathon bombings and the hacking murder of the soldier in London), to debate over the validity of evolution which affects me professionally and embroils my fellow biologists in pointless, mind-numbing debates that make no logical sense at all. Fundamentalism is unfathomable because it's not logic-based and I resent the need to spend so much time attempting to wrap my brain around it.. Snow was essentially about the socio-political demography of Turkey. A Turkish poet who has been living in Germany for years, Ka, goes to a remote Turkish town to write a newspaper article about an upcoming election and a spate of recent suicides by girls. He gets snowed into the town for 3 days, during which time there is a violent coup by secularists to minimize the growing threat of Islamism in the town.. For the entire book, I felt like it just wasn’t written for me. I don’t know if I didn’t like the translation, the original writing, or if there was just a very heavy element of cultural context which I didn’t get, but I felt that Pamuk was just taking a wishy-washy middle road. It felt like Pamuk went to great lengths to point out the good and the evil in both the Islamists and the militant secularists (a uniquely Turkish invention?). I wanted to shake him and make him pick a side. And I wanted that side to be that of the normal run-of-the-mill people who must have been lurking there in the shadows somewhere in the book. Not the high school boys and doting women that idolized Blue, the probable terrorist who was accused of murdering in the name of Islam, and not that bat-shit crazy actor Sunay who staged a coup in the name of secularism.. Perhaps Pamuk had his reasons for taking the middle road but couldn’t he at least have come out decisively anti-murder? This world, that in his book and the real-life world we live in, is dangerously close to becoming one where murder can be justified away. Throughout the book people debate the morality of suicide but never is it really mentioned how amoral murder is. One example, Kadife dramatically removes her headscarf and then murders Sunay at point blank range, on stage during a play. She is then carted off to jail “for her own safety” because the fact that she exposed her hair in public makes her a target for people’s angst more than the fact that SHE JUST MURDERED SOMEONE. How fucked up and frustrating to read….. The character, Ka, is completely preoccupied with his own experiences – falling in love and developing a belief in god – and barely reacts to the events around him, including the MULTIPLE murders that he witnesses. Also, although he is an outsider who most people seem not to like, he somehow becomes a go-between and important player in the coup dynamics… in his 3 days in the town… Major suspensions of disbelief required here…. Artistically, I am willing to admit that this book was very literary and that maybe it just wasn’t my taste. However, the misogyny and the theme of fundamentalism were frustrating to read about. Also, in my opinion, the book was sloppy, disjointed and annoyingly artsy-fartsy, with lots of layers of unnecessary meaning. As others on goodreads have said, how many times must we stare at snow and feel either isolation or desperation or happiness or extreme optimism immediately followed by extreme pessimism? The dialogue was also really unnatural (unless that’s how people converse in Turkey).. Here is an example of a sex scene written in the most artsy-fartsy way possible:. “As he and Ipek made love, he heard music playing inside him, music he’d never heard before, never even imagined, and by obeying its harmonies he found his way forward. From time to time he fell asleep and dreamed of summer holidays bathed in heavenly light; he was running free, he was immortal; his plane was about to fall out of the sky but he was eating an apple, an apple he would never finish, an apple that would last for all time. Then he would wake to the warm apple aroma of Ipek’s skin. Guided by moonlight and the faint yellow glow of the streetlamps, he would press his eyes against Ipek’s and try to see into them. When he saw that she was awake and silently watching him, it seemed to him that they were like two whales basking side by side in shallow water. It was only then that he realized that they were holding hands.”. WTF??","Jan 18, 2013"

529039,Jenny,"Snow is a novel written about an exiled poet who returns to his native land of Turkey to write about the upcoming elections and how fundamentalist Muslim girls are mysteriously committing suicide. When he returns to a remote village in Turkey where he has a couple of contacts (including a beautiful woman he used to know who is recently divorced), he is snowed in and a series of events folds out, both personal (his years-long writers block seems to vanish) and political (major conflict ensues as this small town grapples with how to respond to both the secular state and the religious fundamentalists who are in a sense warring with each other).. I am giving up on this book after reading 185 pages, and I feel conflicted about it. This book came in my Christmas stocking and was recommended to me from my mother-in-law, I believe. The premise of this book is interesting to me and I do believe that there is probably a good story embedded within it...somewhere. However there are so many things about this book that are going against it, that I don't even know where to begin. For one, the story is written in a convoluted way where the narrator will tell you asides and future details while narrating. This type of writing style can be interesting if it can be understood. However, I had a really difficult time understanding the background of where this book comes from, especially concerning the political and religious arenas. It would have been helpful to have a primer or a reading guide in the back of the book to consult. Additionally, these asides and future details just ended up taking me away from the scant plot that there actually is. Furthermore, each chapter in the book seems to capture at most 15 minutes worth of activity, which made it are for me to follow because the action of what was happening was happening at such a slow pace.. You may wonder why I am so conflicted on giving up this book if I am rating it 1 star? Not only did this book come recommended to me, but it also is a national bestseller and is receiving critical acclaim...including being a New York Times Book Review Best Book of the Year. And the author's other novel is a prize-winner as well. How could I not get even a glimmer of that acclaim in my own reading? After reading the 21st chapter and being thoroughly confused (yet again), I considered giving up the book (Gavin has been encouraging this for the past 50-ish pages) and decided to turn to the Goodreads 5 star reviews to see what virtue people got out of the book i hopes of reviving my interest in continuing on. I was surprised when I read a few 5 star reviews that could have easily been 1 star reviews. In other words, it's like people liked that the main character was not interesting and the plot convoluted. As I read reviews to that ilk, I realized that in the worst of worlds with the worst of books, I would never rate a book with an uninteresting main character and involuted plot as 5 stars, so I better quit while I am ahead. Better luck next time.","Dec 27, 2011"
2881911,Farhan Khalid,"The silence of. snow. A snowy, stormy, two-day journey. The bus for. Kars. was leaving immediately. A journey that would change his life forever. Our traveler had spent his years of happiness and childhood in. Istanbul. ; he’d returned a week ago, for the first time in twelve years, to attend his mother’s funeral, and having stayed there four days he decided to take this trip to Kars. He was a poet. He had spent the last twelve years in political exile in. Germany. He was forty-two years old and single. He was shy and enjoyed being alone. His name was. KA. I’m a journalist, Ka whispered in reply. This was a lie. I’m interested in the municipal elections — and also the young women who’ve been committing suicide. This was true. It was as if everything had been erased, lost beneath the snow. These sights spoke of a strange and powerful loneliness. It was as if he were in a place that the whole world had forgotten, as if it were snowing at the end of the world. Symbol of. political Islam. , they’ve begun committing suicide. He felt slightly nervous in her presence. Yes, exactly — that’s how beautiful she was. Kars is backward and poor. He felt a pang of despair for this failing city and its forgotten people. He imagined. Ïpek. uttering the cruelest truth of all:. I’m the nameless defender of nameless heroes who have suffered untold wrongs while seeking to uphold their religious beliefs in a society that is in thrall to secular materialism. Suddenly Ka realized he was in love with Ïpek. Muhtar. might have found a bit of happiness in having brought himself to the brink of an election victory, just as he, Ka, had found a little in having gained a middling reputation as a poet — better than no reputation at all. But as neither man was ever going to admit to happiness at these things, they could not broach the big subject, the bitter truth that stood between them: They had both inured themselves to defeat and to the pitiless unfairness of life. Ka feared that both of them longed for Ïpek as a symbol of escape from this defeatist state of mind. I sense that the world and my life are not without purpose. I hear sounds inside me. It may just have to do with fear of getting old and dying. What brings me close to God is the silence of snow. In this part of the world faith in God was not something achieved by thinking sublime thoughts and stretching one’s creative powers to their outer limits; nor was it something one could do alone; above all it meant joining a mosque, becoming part of a community. Perhaps because you can embrace your religion and your community only if godless secularists like me are overseeing business and government affairs. A man can’t pray to his heart’s content in this country unless he can depend on the efficiency of the atheist who’s an expert at managing the West and the other aspects of worldly business. They’re committing suicide because they’re unhappy. If you can’t put your trust in people, you’ll never get anywhere in life. Political Islamist is only a name that Westerners and seculars give us Muslims who are ready to fight for our religion. We’ve forgotten our own stories. It seems you’ve lost your faith in God. What’s worse, you don’t even know it. The snow reminds me of God. No amount of suffering can justify a believer’s committing this sin. When someone’s faith is this strong, he’ll do anything to keep from committing such a sin. When you love someone above all others, you know everything there is to know about her. Your heart is full of goodness, but you’re afraid of believing in God. A man lives his life, and then he falls apart and soon there is nothing left. Like a snowflake, he would fall as he was meant to fall; he would devote his heart and soul to the melancholy course on which his life was set. He gave his mind over to all the other little things that make up a life and realized how they all added up to a unified whole, he saw a snowflake. He heard the call from deep inside him: the call he heard only at moments of inspiration, the only sound that could ever make him happy, the sound of his muse. Although he had yet to hear the words, he knew it was already written; even as it waited in its hiding place, it radiated the power and beauty of destiny. The snow reminded me of the beauty and mystery of creation, of the essential joy that is life. The first thing you need to learn is humility. If God does not exist, that means heaven does not exist either. And that means the world’s poor, those millions who live in poverty and oppression, will never go to heaven. And if that is so, then how do you explain all the suffering of the poor?. True happiness could only come for the one who sacrificed his own life for the other. In Kars everyone always knows about everything that’s going on. God put me through all this suffering to help me find the path of truth. Let’s have one secret we can share. It’s the best way to begin a friendship. I feel shame in my dreams, that doesn’t mean I’m ashamed of my dreams. If a lot of girls in our situation are thinking about suicide, you could say it has to do with wanting to control our own bodies. For girls like that, a suicide wish is a wish for innocence and purity. When I sense a poem coming to me, my heart is full of gratitude to the sender. Is that the same person who breathes the soul into your poetry? Who is that person?. I want to join in and be just like everyone else. In other words, you’ve fallen in love with me because you know nothing about me? Do you really think you can call this love?. Solitude is essentially a matter of pride; you bury yourself in your own scent. Kars was an extraordinarily quiet city. That’s because we’re afraid of our own voices. When you devote so much of your heart to believing something exists, you can’t help having a little suspicion, a little voice that asks, what if it doesn’t?. People are following us. Unhappiness gives me strength. The only people who can be happy in Kars are the idiots and the villains. Can a human being really know the future? And even if he can’t, can he find peace by convincing himself that he does know the future? This is perfect for my first science-fiction novel. I wanted to be a Westerner and a believer. If that man has been abandoned by God, he’d still be the loneliest man on earth. Each sentence and each object had taken on a life of its own in a magnificent dreamscape to become a poem. It’s your own soul that’s poor. Scarf was symbol of the reactionary darkness in our souls, from which we should liberate ourselves and run to join the modern nations of the West. Ignore the sins of the city’s past and write instead about the beautiful clean air and the inhabitants’ kind hearts. You’ve got to kill them before they kill you. How beautiful was the falling snow!. As if they knew their silent procession would continue until the end of time. How white and how mysterious. The silence was extraordinarily beautiful — bewitching, even. His whole mind was fixed on the beauty of the silent night. This was another voice inside him speaking. There was a familiar smell of wood in his room. He felt himself floating, as if the whole room, the whole hotel, were floating with him. This is why the new poem, which he jotted down in his notebook line by line as it came to him, portrayed. The snowy city of Kars as a single divine unity. Poet's ability to shut off part of his mind even while the world is in turmoil. If this meant that a poet had no more connection to the present than a ghost did, such was the price a poet had to pay for his art. In one of his dreams he watched the snow falling. She might be his only chance for happiness. All he could see was the color inside his head. Because the color was something close to red. Not a day passes when the eagle of dark depression doesn’t take flight in my soul. All the men in the country were paralyzed by depression. What they really wanted was to die, but they didn’t think themselves worthy of suicide. It was. Hegel. who first noticed that history and theater are made of the same materials. Just as in the theater, history chooses those who play the leading roles. What a shame that audiences in our country are not sophisticated enough to understand modern art. I give the people what they want. I spent the years of my youth roaming the streets. I read everything. Sartre. and. Zola. had ever written, and I believed that our future lay with. Europe. No one who’s even slightly westernized can breathe free in this country unless they have a secular army protecting them. I think I may be starting to believe in God here. It’s something I may be hiding even from myself. Even if you did believe in God, it would make no sense to believe alone. You’d have to believe in him the same way the poor do; you’d have to become one of them. We’re here in the name of modern art. What are we to do with this poet of ours, whose intellect belongs to Europe, whose heart belongs to the religious high school militants, and whose head is all mixed up?. He’s in love. Only the purest poets allow love into their hearts in times of revolution. Trust takes time. Time is a scarce commodity in this city. You’re a dervish. God has graced you with lifelong innocence. There’s very little a man can do at this point except wait for time to take its course. If you really love her, all you have to do is tell her all the beautiful things you feel about her: why you love her, why you want to marry her. When a good poet is confronted with difficult facts that he knows to be true but also inimical to poetry, he has no choice but to flee to the margins; it was this very retreat that allowed him to hear the hidden music that is the source of all art. It is not poverty that brings us so close to God; it’s the fact that no one is more curious than we are to find out why we are here on earth and what will happen to us in the next world. There are thousands of Turkish-Kurdish intellectuals in Germany who’ve turned that pity into a livelihood. Life was a meaningless string of random incidents. Most oppressed people are in the wrong to an almost ridiculous degree. To express beliefs without conviction was liberating. Everything she said had a double meaning; as for this game she was playing with her eyes — averting her gaze one moment, staring at him intensely the next — he could only assume that this was just another way of transmitting the same mixed message. Everyone he met in Kars spoke in the same code, and so harmoniously that they seemed almost a single chorus. What was the difference between love and the agony of waiting?. The worst thing was knowing that no one even noticed his fear, his misery, his loneliness. Let the snow keep falling, he thought; let it fall for days and months on end; let it cover the city of Kars so completely that no one will ever find it again. He wanted to fall asleep on this bed and not wake up until it was a sunny morning and he a child again, with his mother. It seemed to him that this remote room on this remote corridor had split away from the hotel and floated off to the most remote corner of this empty city. And the quiet of this empty city was as if the world had come to an end, and it was snowing. Ka turned his head to watch the snow falling in Ïpek’s eyes. How much can we ever know about the love and pain in another’s heart?. The soul leaves the body six hours after death. According to. Suyuti. , at that instant the soul is a mercurial thing, and it has to sit in. Berzah. till the. Day of Judgment. . But. Necip’s. soul decided to enter my body instead. I’m sure of this. I’m also very much afraid, because this is never mentioned in the. Koran. . But there’s no other way I can explain how I fell in love with. Kadife. so quickly. So the idea of committing suicide over her wasn’t mine either. Do you think it could be true that Necip’s soul has taken refuge in my body?. Necip’s soul has planted these thoughts in me. I have two souls inside my body: atheist and Islamist soul. Our wretched lives have no place in human history. One day all of us living now in Kars will be dead and gone. No one will remember us; no one will care what happened to us. Heroic dreams are the consolation of the unhappy. If you don’t have any principles, and if you don’t have faith, you can’t be happy at all. People who seek only happiness never find it. It just seems dangerous to be this happy. That’s how I know something terrible is going to happen. It was a snowflake that mapped out the spiritual course of every person who had ever lived. The three axes onto which he mapped his poems: Memory, Imagination, and Reason. His poetic materials were shaped by mysterious external forces. Germany – I traveled from city to city enjoying the very Protestant comforts Ka had described in one of his poems, I sat by the window peacefully watching the reflections of the grassy plains, the villages with the sweet little churches nestled in the mountain foothills. I would wander through the cold empty city and pretend I was Ka walking the same streets to escape the painful memories of Ïpek. She could now see her own home through the eyes of a stranger. If a person knew exactly why she was committing suicide and could state her reasons openly, she wouldn’t have to kill herself. The main reason women commit suicide is to save their pride. She does it to show her pride. Women kill themselves because they hope to gain something. Men kill themselves because they’ve lost hope of gaining anything. Women commit suicide to escape all forms of punishment. Two soldiers, running toward each other with clownish steps, pulled the curtains shut. The sighs of the sad city of Kars rose from the street","May 12, 2020"
310055,J.I.,"In a way, the problems with Snow are not necessarily its fault. Plenty of books have done it before and so it is by now tradition. Yes, I am talking about it having absolutely no idea what love is nor how it is manifest. The poet Ka travels to the small town of Kars with the stated goal of writing about a string of suicides over headscarves by young girls, but with a more specific reason of marrying Ipek, a woman he briefly knew in school and who he knows is single and beautiful.. I get it, beautiful women are beautiful. So Ka falls in love with Ipek. Why is it that so many writers are wholly unable to distinguish between love and lust? Sure, there are notes here and there where characters seem to acknowledge this, but it is treated as so matter of fact that this emotion that Ka feels is really, truly love.. The plot meanders, with Ka wandering around the town of Kars, speaking with people about the suicides and also the political strife between secularism and radical Islam. Interesting ideas. There is some intrigue in hearing the two sides of the extreme, both woefully ignorant, but there exists in the town no real mediators, no one who is able to acknowledge both points with any degree of competency. Of course the idea is to show the breakdown of communication, which is noble, but the method is to have a mediator that is simply a bumbler.. Along side the lack of any real bridge to understanding and Ka's infatuation, there are the poems. Ka is struck by the muse on his trip, receiving 19 poems (apparently long ones because they are enough for a book) from nowhere. The work of poetry is reduced to the simplicity of inspiration. What a sad state of affairs for a writer to put forward such a silly notion. But then the novelist introduces himself, yes, a Novelist named Orhan, as the narrator of this story. He doesn't seem too bothered to draw from beyond his sources, dipping into their minds even though he could not actually, to present his story of...what?. Not to belabor the point but Snow doesn't go anywhere. I don't mean that in the wonderful sense of a book that moves nothing but explains so much. Why does Ka fall for Ipek? There is no reason other than she is beautiful. Why do the poems come from nowhere? Because they were inspired. Why don't the secularists and the Islamists ever acknowledge the other? Because no one ever says anything even remotely clever. I had hoped for some interesting showing of character, but was disappointed to the last.. Slow reading, a dearth of sense and a middling I don't know puts this book on the bottom of the recommendation pile.","Jul 26, 2009"
5927877,Kyriakos Sorokkou,"[Orhan, flashes forward four years and reveals that Ka spent the last years of his life obsessing over İpek and writing unsent letters to her before being murdered in Frankfurt. The narrator will play a much larger role in the story in the later chapters of the novel. We are clearly meant to identify the narrator with Orhan Pamuk himself, as he later names The Black Book as one of his works, as well as The Museum of Innocence, which he would publish in 2008."".

12083674,Michael David,"The West is mystical and mysterious to the East; the opposite applies, too: the East (I'm speaking in huge generalizations here, but I think it applies) is also most often dumbfounded by the actions and cultures of the west. There are people who dwell on the narrow borders between these beliefs, however, and oftentimes they are the ones that are able to describe these two entities well. These are the immigrants, the dispossessed, the mestizos, and the exiles, whether of their own accord or other people's.. The primary character of Snow, Ka, is a member of this fringe group. He is an exile of his own volition and returned to Turkey primarily to chase a dream and search for his lost love. I had sincerely wanted to believe that a good story would come out from such a wonderful premise, but I was fooling myself. As a member of the East (despite being corrupted by a myriad of influences), it was just a soap opera to me that I easily tired of.. I guess the difference of perspectives from a good number of its critics and I is that I live within such a world: I live in a place that is similar to Kars. I'm not saying that it snows heavily in here that roads are blocked; I'm not saying that it even snows here at all. What I'm saying is that if the setting had been made tropical, the story itself would be nothing special, especially here in the Philippines. Its twists merely suggest a run-of-the-mill thriller and soap opera. It's not as if I am unfamiliar with the chiaroscuro of rebellion and religious fervor. After all, I was born and grew up in a place equally influenced by its Christianity and its Islamist beliefs.. Blue's acts of rebellion, the blind submission to religious rulers, and internecine encounters are not unfamiliar to a resident of Mindanao. It's an everyday occurrence. When one truly looks into the story material, there's nothing novel about it, at least to me. I was not impressed at the laughable actions of the characters, especially because despite the fact that I know I'm stupid, the characters have an unbelievable excess of this stupidity. It's like the raki they drink in copious amounts. The only good thing about the story is its farce.. This is probably because I live in the Philippines. Truth in here is a lot stranger than Snow's fiction.","Feb 28, 2013"
4534242,C. Scott,"This was my first foray into Serious Literature in a while. This book was originally written in Turkish but the English translation is still beautiful. However, beautiful prose really isn't my jam.. I liked this book but I think the author made two critical mistakes - one I understand the other I don't. The first was to not even attempt to show any of the supposedly great poetry written by our main character Ka during his visit to Kars. The reason is clear and reminds me of the problem that Aaron Sorkin ran into when he made his disastrous flop ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip."" Sorkin's story was set at a hip, important tv show in the mode of Saturday Night Live - but whenever he tried to show any of the ""important"" or ""funny"" sketches from his show within a show they all sucked. 30 Rock solved this problem by making its show within a show an unfunny show - so the writers didn't actually have to come up with any funny sketches. Orhan Pamuk makes a similar choice to never show us any of the poems in his book - good or bad. Like I said, I understand the logic in not showing any poems, but I feel like it was a mistake to make NO attempt.. The second mistake, which I don't understand, was the use of an ""Orhan Pamuk"" character as a semi-omniscient narrator introduced later in the book. I was baffled at first. I said to myself ""Wait, this omniscient narrator who's been telling this entire story, including inner thoughts and everything, is actually supposed to be a friend working off the very detailed notes of our protagonist??"" Give me a break. I found this to be a pretty silly affectation and it wasn't revealed until well into the book. Why did the author do this? Was this simply a device to get out of having to show any of Ka's poetry to the reader? If so it is a pretty extravagant work around.. I'll admit, now that I think about it, if that's really the reason he introduced himself into the text I might have just talked myself into being okay with it. But neither of the interviews with Pamuk that I read in the New York Times or the Paris Review even asked about it.","May 23, 2016"
4693,Ali,"I won’t say Snow is a great novel, but it’s wonderfull, well formulated with a perfect illustrated description about what’s going on in such a typical society in our area. I understand if the situation is not very much understandable for outsider readers, but those who know the situation in our societies, and at the same time are fair and equitable enough, would probably say that Snow is a very realistic drawing of what we’re suffering of. I, on my behalf understand every single character in the novel, even “Ka” whom like Nabokov, when he was 19th, “keeps on writing his solitary poems while he heard the guns and saw bloody fights from his window”! or when Necip (a young character) dreams about a ""landskape"", almost the same as Nabokov's (Speak, Memory).. I liked very much the allegory about the snow which in one way is as beautiful as God’s message, and on the other hand trap the small city, inclusive Ka, as tide and closed as the people’s minds, no matter what ideals they have and which ideology they support.. Apart from some small holes here and there in Pamuk’s description (how the narrator could manage to know every thing about everyone), the novel is beautifully formed with different informations about so many characters and situations, unless Pamuk doesn’t tell us; in a city which is trapped in snow so badly that no train can leave and no car can enter, even the army is not able to reach the city, how people could produce food during 4 days!. می توانم حدس بزنم که این کتاب به فارسی ترجمه نشده باشد، چون اگر ترجمه شده باشد هم، دست کم نیمی از کتاب زیر تیغ سانسور تحریف می شود، یا بهم می ریزد. خواندن کتاب را به همه ی هم وطنان، به ویژه خانم ها، توصیه می کنم. یادداشت بلندی هم در مورد ""برف"" دارم، در اینجا بخوانید. http://www.ali-ohadi.com/global/index...","Sep 27, 2007"

38749612,Kluxorious Kluxces,"Understanding is everything, although it does not immediately change anything.. The title of this book is just absolutely perfect. This novel turn out to be governed by a ""deep and mysterious underlying structure"" similar to that of a snowflake. The deeper you read, the more the symmetries multiply. Nearly every character has a double, down to the narrator himself, who is eventually revealed to be a novelist friend of Ka's named Orhan. Clever twist. All these mirror images might create a dizzying effect, which is deepened by the snow that begins to fall on the first page of the novel and does not let up until nearly the end.. IMHO, this book does shed some lights of what our world as we know it is becoming. It is as much about Islam as about anything else. To most people nowadays - secularist or whatever they want to call themselves, religion is nothing more than a foreign word. God help them.. Bear in mind this book was published in Turkey and Europe before September 11. After reading it, I feel like the novel has an ominous prescience to it as it seems like life attempting an awkward imitation of his art.. I definitely recommend this book. The only problems with it IMO come from it being a translation but you'll enjoy it nonetheless. It may not be the easiest read, but it's an important one.. Understanding is everything, even when it changes nothing. Perhaps it is all we at times, can do.","Aug 12, 2015"
235153,Quinn Slobodian,"A tricky book, where you don't know if the things that make it sometimes trying are commentary on the monotony of the perennial uprising-coup-calm-uprising cycle of Turkish politics, if the things that make it sometimes saccharine are commentary on the tropes of Ottoman folklore, if the predictability of the male characters are commentary on the sad realities of the eternal masculine. It's devised to keep the reader at a double distance, told as a reconstruction of an author Orhan of his poet friend's Ka's trip to far eastern Turkish town of Kars. Both narrator and poet are secular intellectuals from Istanbul so they're mistrusted by the locals who rely on exaggerating their essential difference from the ""Europeanized"" capital and its residents for a stable sense of self. The pacing and tone begins as reportage but oozes inexorably toward melodrama, the episodic chapters becoming mirrored in the Mexican soap opera Marianna that the city's inhabitants are always intently watching. The morality of the novel too is finally that of melodrama: politics, religion, art, all things are conjugations of the desire to love and be loved. The author and his characters struggle and rail against this conclusion but return to it eventually relieved, its basic truth as reliable as the arrival of troops from Ankara.","Sep 08, 2007"

19559912,Vanessa Bouna,"This review comes on the heels of my second reading. Upon the first, I knew that it was a book that could be re-read multiple times and its second reading proves it. Snow is Pamuk's masterpiece. It is a story that takes place over three days over which the heartbreaking crossroads that every Turk finds himself facing in so many facets of his/her every day life are exposed, in every dialogue and by every character. Had you ever had trouble grasping Turkey's position as she straddles East and West coming off of her glorious history as successor to the Ottoman Empire, every issue that she faces is addressed here. Published in 2002, it is no less relevant today in 2018. Secularism, political Islam, atheism, the position of women, the Kurdish border issue, terrorism, and community all fleshed out ever so raw and natural as Pamuk spins this tale. Truly a nailbiter till the very end, with Snow itself both the backdrop and almost a character in its own right, I couldn't recommend it highly enough.","Dec 01, 2014"

I read it in Turkish thinking that it would give me a taste of Eastern Turkey in its rich vocabulary.I was dissapointed to see that Pamuk used Turkish text only as a draft to transfer it to English reader with translation.I felt that he addressed the people who wanted to see the East in a certain frame from an orientalist point of view so to say. I think Turkish society and politics has certain issues he could touch upon and give life to through his writing and make a passage to solutions in a sense.However it was a complete devaluation of society and people living in that land. It sounded almost like a response ""Yes, we are."" given to orientalists.He uses his characters as vessels of caricatures of the vices and ideologies that he disdains.Pamuk has no empathy with the people he describes.","Apr 10, 2010"

As were the two main scenes at the theatre where life, art, politics and religion all combined to see murder, a sad coup and various groups arguing the complex merits of Islam versus Westernisation. There was also a bit of satire lampooning the comical security of police, military, rebel and others trailing and recording each other..

86846,Emily,"In the common run of things, I read and enjoy many books often criticized in the wider world as ""boring."". Omnibus editions of abstract contemporary poetry?. Bring them on.. Tomes of existentialist biography?. Among my favorite books around.. Histories of textile crafts?. Can't imagine life without them. I generally consider calling a book boring to be a failure on the part of the reader, and when I read an essay that levels this criticism I am often left with a shrewd suspicion that the book under review is one I'll appreciate.. All of which said...I must admit that every time I picked up Orhan Pamuk's. Snow. , I was overwhelmed by sleep. Literally. I had trouble reading more than ten pages at a time without nodding off, so strong was the novel's soporific power. When you note its 440-page length, you'll have some notion why my post on Pamuk is overdue. This is especially disappointing because the book has so much potential, and sounds like irresistible literary candy to me rather than the mildly interesting but narcotic slog it turned out to be. I went into it expecting a Turkish version of the tight, labyrinthine plot twists in Salman Rushdie's. The Moor's Last Sigh. , but without the magical realism and with a sinister pinch of David Lynch added. (Amazing, in other words. Do any of you know a novel that is. actually. like this?) Alas, it is more like a twelve-hour version of. My Dinner with André. , transposed into a Turkish tea-house and with occasional random shooting thrown in.. So many things about Pamuk's premise are intriguing to me. We have a frame narrative in which the unreliable narrator ""Orhan Pamuk"" pieces together, from interviews and documents, the story of his late poet friend Ka, and in particular a pivotal three-day trip Ka took to the provincial town of Kars, four years before his death. Ka is supposed to have composed his final book of poetry in Kars, although the manuscript has since gone missing. Orhan's romanticism, feelings of inadequacy, sorrow at Ka's death, and incomplete information lead him to draw conclusions about the poet's brilliance and seriousness that the reader will probably not share. Likewise, Ka's own set of biases and behaviors—including his childhood nostalgia for Kars, to which he is returning after many years; his infantile notions of love at first sight; his capricious and vacillating relationship to God and religion; the extreme, dream-like density that overtakes him at key moments; and his simplistic pursuit of the feeling he calls ""happiness""—make him deeply untrustworthy as well. There are some clever moments that make use of the unreliable, un-self-aware narration, especially early in the book. I liked the description of the bus Ka rides in on, and the atmosphere as the falling snow gets heavier and heavier:. Fear had already fostered a strong fellow feeling among the passengers, and before long Ka also felt at one with them. Even though he was sitting just behind the driver, Ka was soon doing the same as the passengers behind him: whenever the bus slowed to negotiate a bend in the road or avoid going over the edge of a cliff, he stood up for a better view; when the zealous passenger who'd committed himself to helping the driver by wiping the condensation from the windscreen missed a corner, Ka would point it out to the man with his forefinger (which contribution went unnoticed); and when the blizzard became so bad that the wipers could no longer keep the snow from piling up on the windscreen, Ka would join the driver in trying to guess where the road was.. On one hand, we have probably all experienced that sensation of fellow-feeling that results from being in an enclosed area with other people during an emergency. On the other hand, it's pretty plain here that while Ka may feel ""at one"" with the other passengers, they probably don't feel at one with him. All his actions allow him the illusion of belonging, but no one else is responding to him: the wiper of the windshield either ignores his contribution or doesn't even realize he's there, while the driver can hardly benefit from Ka sharing in his attempts to guess the position of the road. It's a nice foreshadowing of the challenges Ka will meet later on in the town, and his over-confidence in his own impressions, even when those impressions veer wildly from one extreme to another from moment to moment. Orhan's narration seems to realize some of Ka's foibles (he points out the ignored input on the windscreen, for example), but also seems to buy in, at surprising moments, to Ka's own illusions.. In any case, this tricky double-blind narration is accompanied by yet more promising elements. Take the classic locked-door setup: all roads into Kars are closed due to heavy snow just as Ka arrives. Or the sinister provincial theater troupe which arrives on the same train as Ka and strikes him as oddly familiar. Or the dueling shady law-enforcement agencies leaning on the town paper, which reports events before they happen. Or the multiple tragic and spooky background events of Kars (an epidemic of young women have been committing suicide; a sherbet vendor may or may not be poisoning her customers; a small-time political coup will soon erupt on live television; a minister of education is gunned down in a pastry shop). With this great line-up, how could the book lose?. Through near-glacial narration, for one thing. See the passages on sleep, unavoidable sleep, above. I suppose one could view Pamuk's super-slow pacing as a clever reference to the fact that the town is locked down by ice, but in practice it very much drags by. Also, Pamuk's approach to politics strikes me as clumsy. Unlike in, say,. The Moor's Last Sigh. or Mario Vargas Llosa's. Conversation in the Cathedral. , where the political concerns are reflected in the events and fabric of the narration, in. Snow. we get chapters on chapters of people actually sitting in the various hotel rooms and tea-shops of Kars, and conversing about the relationship between the West and the East, the atheists versus the Islamists, and so on. I'm not saying there isn't a way to write an engaging novel made up largely of conversation, but in my opinion. Snow. is not that novel. The result here ends up feeling more like an author's notes on themes he wishes to address in a novel, than the novel itself. Add to that a similarly half-baked attempt at addressing gender issues, which pays lip service to the fetishization of female beauty but nonetheless fails endow its female characters with much depth beyond their opinions on whether to wear headscarves, and you have a frustrating execution of a stellar concept.. Notes on Disgust. Other than a few passing references to things most readers will find mildly disgusting (one character remembers a time several years ago when some religious high school students threw a bucket of sewer water over a statue, for example), the explicit mentions of disgust all involve the radical Islamist character Blue. As a Westernized Turk and rumored atheist who has spent many years in Germany, Ka is already the object of Blue's contempt, but when Ka displays these Westernized traits openly, Blue's emotions cross the line into disgust. Pausing in his ""reminiscences"" about a German couple he knows (he is actually making the whole thing up), Ka notes that ""Blue was now eyeing him with open revulsion."" Later, when Blue has been manipulated into collaborating with people from different factions from his own (Kurds and Westernized atheists), we have this scene:. Holding her father's hand, Kadife tried to make sense of the disgust and contempt she could see in Blue's face. Blue felt that he had walked into a trap, but, fearing what people would say about him if he left, he remained, against his better judgment.. In the first scene, disgust functions as a clear-cut policer of us versus them: Ka is revealing himself to be a proud member of ""them"" (Westerners), and Blue is repulsed because he considers members of ""them"" to be less fully human than members of ""us."" The role of Blue's disgust in the context of the book is to demonstrate to the reader his strong, dehumanizing opinions on Westerners.. In the second scene, some of Blue's disgust is turned inward: he is disgusted with himself for having allowed ""them"" to contaminate him to the extent that he has agreed to collaborate. Without doubt he is also disgusted at being in the presence of so many people he considers ""them."" Possibly, he might also be disgusted with himself that he cares enough about ""what people would say"" to let it influence his actions. For the reader, Blue's disgust in this scene further cements his stand-offish and volatile character. It increases the tension in the scene by convincing us any collaboration involving Blue will be unsuccessful, while making a larger point about the dehumanization of our political opponents. Or at least...that's what I think it's. trying. to do.","Jul 29, 2011"
23839488,Miruna Caragheorgheopol,"Slow. Slow, slow. So slow, that I actually needed a book club to motivate myself to wrap Snow. up and unpack my views, opinions and feelings.. Despite the difficulty of actually reading this brick of a book, and the tendency I felt to throw the brick away, I found out I liked it, enjoyed it, and found myself a bit richer deep-down for having finished it (much in spite of the fact that if I read the word ""snow"", or similes for ""snow"", or metaphors for snow, or epithets for snow, or anything snow-related that's supposed to be a symbol, or not-snow-related-but-deeply-symbolic-anyway, I might explode). The history of Kars itself, the town at the centre of the novel, is fascinating, and it reveals a mix of people, ethnicity and religion that is very complex and interesting, and this book helps paint it in a curious shade of ""I want to find out more about all this!"". Inside this brick, there is an incredible slowness of narrative pace, as if you are inside a foggy soup. Said fogginess extends to the main character and to the events pertaining to him or happening around him, as if everything is unreal. Events are muffled, feelings are muffled, even if they are supposed to be strong and intense. As if snow has anything to do with it (you know, those snowy days when all the sounds are otherworldly and, well, muffled.) Not to mention the narrator is so unreliable he takes the shape of the author and starts intruding more and more as the novel progresses, getting close to upstaging the stage of the novel (and there is an actual stage in the novel, and actual plays, and they are essential).. The foggy feeling carries on to a lot of conversations, and they feel a bit stilted, with a certain dose of seriousness, a bit of humour and some injection of soap opera. You might have to have a deep knowledge of Turkish history and politics to understand everything that is going on (not much, but a lot more is implied), and the characters involved, whatever political or religious side they are on, are portrayed quasi-neutrally. That is nice, since one theme revealed towards the end is the fact that you can't really encompass another culture's way of life superficially: those people might seem silly, simple, backwards and barbaric to you as a westerner, but whatever's churning beneath the surface of the Turkish tarragon soup is way more complicated.. There is so much symbolism in everything, so I will just add three things that caught my eye. Firstly, the main character is a poet, and he is supposed to have those revelations - poems that come upon him fully-formed out of nowhere - and here is a stroke of evil genius: Pamuk has managed to write a book about a poet without showing us a single poem of his (though he did draw a very nice diagram of those poems shaped like... a snowflake!).. Secondly, the scene during the first play in the theatre sent shivers up my spine since it was really well written. I never thought a summary of bullet trajectories could be so engrossing!. Thirdly, I am not sure if the portrayal of women in this novel is intended to be as it is or...it is quite antiquated and objectifying? I mean, Ipek, the woman for whom almost everybody pines, is very, very beautiful, and that's pretty much it. She doesn't get a lot of agency, in fact, her sister seems to be much more contoured as a character and clearly in control of her own actions, and she's wearing the headscarf on top of it.. There is probably so much stuff that escaped me, because there is certainly stuff I clocked on and I didn't write about all of it. But... if there is something happening in this novel, it is there for a REASON, and that reason has symbolic importance and....it gets a bit too much at times. It could have done with a bit more editing, 550 pages of all of the above can get really taxing, and the overall effect is of a reader trudging tiredly through metre-high...snow!","Feb 10, 2020"
22269025,robin friedman,"Snow. Orhan Pamuk's novel ""Snow"" is a meditation on Religion, Poetry, Love, Gender relations, and Politics. It is a difficult, challenging work. Although the author himself described ""Snow"" as a political novel, it is much more. I learned something of Turkey and its politics from the book, but I was moved far more by the author's reflections on issues that transcend the politics of a particular place.. ""Snow"" is the story of a man known as Ka. Raised in a secular home in Istanbul, Ka is 42 and unmarried when the book begins. He has just returned from a 12 year political exile in Frankfurt, Germany to attend his mother's funeral. While in Istanbul, Ka arranges to visit a border Turkish city named Kars to cover the upcoming local elections (the mayor of Kars has just been assassinated), to investigate a rash of suicides among young Muslim women, and to try to kindle a romance with a beautiful woman named Ipek with whom he had been acquainted as a student and who has recently been divorced. Ka is a poet. During his years in Frankfurt, he never learned German but continued to write in Turkish. He had not been able to compose poetry during his final four years in Frankfurt and, during that time, he had had no romantic involvements. Ka's story is related in the voice of a writer named Orhan - creating some distance and some sense of irony -- who describes himself as a novelist and an old friend of the poet. He visits Kars four years after the death of his friend and tells his story.. Ka spends all of three days in Kars before returning again to Frankfurt, but the short time is eventful for the city and for the protagonist. He witnesses a murder in a cafe and a coup in which the military takes control of the city and suspends the upcoming elections. He becomes, briefly, sexually involved with Ipek. Although a secularist, he becomes drawn to religion and meets with a Shiek. He also has fateful encounters with a charismatic Islamic terrorist, Blue, with whom Ipek and her younger sister Kadiffe have been romantically involved. Perhaps most importantly, Ka finds himself able to write poetry again. In his few days in Kars, he composes 19 poems in bursts of inspiration, all but one of which he writes in a faded green notebook.. During Ka's visit, Kars is in the midst of a three-day snowstorm which closes access to the city. The falling snow is the critical symbol of the book which appears in virtually every chapter with many meanings. It symbolizes,variously, silence, isolation and loneliness, cold, purity, innocence, sadness, and much else. Ka becomes captured by the six-sided figure of the snowflake. The individuality of each snowflake becomes emblematic to him of the human condition. When he returns to Frankfurt after his three days in Kars, he devises an elaborate symbolism for the classification of the 19 poems he composed in the city based upon the six sides of the snowflake. Another pervasive symbolic object in the book is the dog -- both as a family pet and as a stray. Dogs appear on the streets as an object of affection and compassion.. Ka's short and tangled love affair with Ipek is at the center of this novel as Ka hopes to have her return with him to Frankfurt. This hope is dashed against Ka's own weaknesses and ambivalences, together with politics and chance. When he returns to Frankfurt, he becomes a lonely, alienated figure, unable to write poetry, who wanders the streets and becomes addicted to pornography. Four years after his return he is murdered under circumstances suggesting political motivation.. ""Snow"" has a great deal to say in its long discussions of the search for God, the nature of creativity, and the need for love. Pamuk's treatment of these universal human themes is intertwined carefully with his particularism -- his discussion of the streets, places and people of Kars. Pamuk also focuses upon the complex political situation of Turkey, torn by the wish to become part of the European community and retaining its religious, Muslim character. Secularism and religion are each represented in this book in several alternatives rather than by just two diametrically opposed groups. The tension in the local political situation becomes a symbol of range of choices that individuals in all cultures must face, as part of being human.. This book has received a variety of reviews on this site. It is a slow, difficult work that may not be to everyone's liking. For those readers with a bent for philosophical and religious reflection, ""Snow"" is an outstanding novel.. Robin Friedman","Jan 02, 2019"

I loved his memoir-cum-history Istanbul but could not, hard as I tried, finish My name is red.. What then is it about? The main action covers three days in the life of Ka, a Turkish poet recently returned from 12 years exile in Germany, who comes to Kars (in far east Turkey) ostensibly to write about the suicide epidemic among young women, but whose secondary (or perhaps primary!) reason is to fall in love with an old school-friend, Ipek. Soon after he arrives, however, the coup occurs and Ka is, rather unwillingly, caught up in the intrigue between the competing interests: the secularists, the Islamic fundamentalists, and the Kurdish nationalists.

565777,Christina,"Some authors can write books where they reveal huge parts of the plot or the entire ending long time in advance but still manage to keep you interested and reading on. Pamuk is one of these authors. Not only does he have a way with words, he also knows how to write a story.. This entire book is told by a man looking back on three days his now deceased friend Ka spent snowed in in a small city called Kars, investigating his life afterwards in Germany and trying to figure out who killed him. This narrator is in no sense reliable as he himself is the first to point out since he can’t know everything about Ka’s experiences in Kars or about his life beforehand or afterwards.. The man spending these three days in Kars is a poet and he goes to Kars to investigate a series of suicides committed by girls who were forbidden to wear head scarves. Or – that’s the official reason. Really, he goes there to try to reclaim his youth and to try and make it with the girl of his dreams.. What he’s getting into, is so much more. While he’s there, a live theatre show is transmitted to the entire city. This is the show where soldiers start shooting the audience and in a sense takes the entire city as hostages – at least until the roads are cleared again. So much happens in these three days. In a way, Kars becomes Turkey and everything that goes on in Turkey politically, goes on in Kars in these short three days where the city is separated from the rest of the country. There’s terrorists, peace talk attempts, religious conflicts, shootings and more.. Even though you know the way it all ends for Ka, Pamuk still keeps you enthralled throughout the book. You know he is shot in Germany, you know he lives there alone and never makes it with Ipek. But still, you want to read on and find out what happens. And in the end, you don’t know a lot more about Ka since his identity is only coming through via some notebooks, stories from people he met in Kars and the few people he knew in Germany.. This book is so beautifully written. Pamuk uses the snow that surrounds the city and cut it off from the rest of the world so extraordinary. This is one of my favorite quotes about the snow: “It was as if he were in a place that the whole world had forgotten; as if it were snowing at the end of the world.” (p. 10). So beautiful.. And not only does he write so beautiful about this, he also manages to write an interesting and insightful book about religion, politics, faith and secularism and about life in Turkey. He dives into identity and the question of how well we can know each other and the author/narrator’s role: “How much can we ever know about the love and pain in another’s heart? /…/ So it is when Orhan the novelist peers into the dark corners of his poet friend’s difficult and painful life: how much can he really see?” (p. 266).. I love how Pamuk hints at the relation between fiction and real life, how he inserts himself as a character in the story and refers to both himself and a later published work (The Museum of Innocence) directly in the text – while continuing to assert that he is not an all-knowing narrator. So there’s a Orhan in the book trying to figure out what happened to his friend Ka and an Orhan writing a novel about what happened to a man named Ka. How do fiction relate to reality, what can we learn by reading a novel, can a novel change anything?. This is a political novel. Pamuk wants to show us his Turkey. Since we’re the West and therefore never can see Turkey as a Turk does – which is made even more difficult by the fact that there are more one point of view but the Turkish Government see all people living in Turkey as Turks and doesn’t recognize that some of them have other ethnicities which is a leading cause for many of the conflicts. Anyway, this is Pamuk’s attempt to show us Turkey and what’s going on in it with regard to the relations between the various groups, the inner conflicts in the country between religion, faith, political views and more.. This book really got Pamuk high up on my list of authors to read. Not only is his language amazing, his story are so interesting and what we need to be reading to learn about the world, ourselves and each other. I have one other book by him on my shelf – The Museum of Innocence: If all his books are this good, I’ve found another favorite author.","Aug 14, 2009"

It is different from everything I have read so far and it has been an interesting experience.. It was definitely not easy to read and it took me quite some time to get used to. Orhan Pamuk's. writing style, but the most important thing has been the message of the book - it opened up a new perspective on quite some elements and I have been reflecting them from a different perspective. I would say that. Schnee. is a book one should try to read and I think that it is a book that will stay on your mind for a while, but I also think that it is difficult to understand in its entirety if you are coming from. the outside. of the controversy - just like I do..

76999,Katie Lambden,"Somehow I misplaced this book while in the middle of it! Argh...is there anything more frustrating! Well, I'll review it when I find it and finish it.. 8/07. Part of the reason I misplaced this book while in the middle of it was that it was taking me forever to get through. Not exactly a page turner. I did eventually find it again, and vowed to plow through to the end. It is, after all, a Nobel Prize winner, and I figured the excruciatingly slow pace and dark, gloomy subject MUST be leading up to a really deep and worthwhile finale. Here's a quick plot sketch (no spoilers):. A lonely, shy, and awkward Turkish poet (named Ka), having lived in political exile in Germany for years, returns for a visit to his native country and decides to visit the remote and derelict city of Kars. He ostensibly makes the trip to report on the sociopolitical happenings of this town (Muslim girls have been committing suicide over the issue of being forced to remove their headscarves, which they've chosen to wear for religious/political reasons). However, his real motivation is to see Ipek, the woman he was in love with many years ago.. Soon after Ka arrives in Kars, a snowstorm shuts off all routes into and out of the city. Many strange things start to happen, including scuffles between radical Islamic students and the government, and finally a coup by a passionate and deranged actor/theater director. Ka is drawn into the middle of the politics through no desire of his own (but a desire to win the love of Ipek). Throughout all the madness, poems are flowing from him as they haven't in years, and Ka struggles to make sense of his own life and unhappiness.. If this sounds like it adds up to a dark, serious, and possibly even depressing book, that's probably because it does. The mood of the book is aptly symbolized by the snow motif: when I recall the book it's with a sense of heaviness, of pewter grey sky and pervading cold.. I think it was, after all, a deep book: with a statement to make about human nature in general, and Turkish nature (both individual and cultural) in particular. However, I was so numbed by the end that I'm not sure Pamuk's philosophical ideas made much of an impression on me. (What was numbing was not only the dreariness of the landscape - literal and figurative - that the book describes, but the crawling pace of the action and the unnumerable characters, parties, and names to keep track of.). What made the biggest impression on me was a sense of Kars itself as a Turkish city, and the cultural and political struggles of the nation. Although there was a lot of political history in the book which confused me (actually, I would recommend that a reader start with a Wikipedia read on the subject of modern Turkish history - this would probably make the book easier to follow), I did gain a sense of how different elements of Turkish society grate against one another and sometimes violently collide.","May 08, 2007"
657496,Jeremy Allan,"Pamuk infuriates me. I remember reading his Nobel acceptance speech and chafing at his ideas about art, where it comes from, what it is meant to do, who has the ability to make it. There is always a sense with him of art being singularly a gift, and one bestowed upon a rare few. This persists in. Snow. . And I resist that.. Yet it is impossible to deny that in many ways this is a beautiful book. There is no question that Pamuk, himself, is gifted. And even where I grumbled to read about the poet-protagonist, Ka,. receiving. his poems from some divine, muse-like, other realm, I could not help but admire the labyrinthine weave of this story. I could not resist the somber treatments on love, infatuation, beauty, and violence. That these themes are enacted via very contemporary questions about the secular state in Turkey, with reflections elsewhere, well that only fortifies the universal themes.. I will remark, though, that in. Snow. Pamuk suffers from a fault I've found in Ishiguro, a certain methodical approach to certain devices—the event of Ka sitting down to write a poem, for example, reoccurs somewhere near 18 times throughout the novel. As a poet myself, I found this hard to bear; I can only imagine this trope's proliferation must drag for others even more. The mechanization—because that is how it begins to feel—breaks the spell of the narrative, and not, I believe, for gain. This is not a Brechtian disruption. It's simply a writer's tick, which I find notable in a writer who professes to believe in art as something that cannot be taught.. One final observation before I sum up: my edition comes from the ""Revolutionary Writing"" series from Faber & Faber. While this book deals with some difficult issues regarding Islam, secular government in Turkey, and, again, violence, I don't find this to be revolutionary in itself. For me, it takes more than a few hints toward the Armenian genocide in order to be in revolt. And I don't guess that revolt was ever Pamuk's aim, if it matters at all.. In conclusion: a fine book, but as much because it frustrated me as due to its craft. I suppose, though, it is a prerequisite for love, in my experience, that there be arguments.","Apr 30, 2011"
147229,Ci,"I stopped at page 139. Moved from hushed respectfulness to the exulted statue of the author and this book, I have allowed much to error on my own side all through the previous chapters. Maybe the world of that Pamuk is creating is so dramatically different and artistically beyond my own imagination and education. But then again, I have came clean to declare that this book does not create a sense of narrative cohesion to propel a reader's searching for meaning or pleasure in reading. A few reasons for giving up:. (1) The self-insertion of the author: why? how does this ""meta-narrator"" is going to do anything profoundly important?. (2) Ka: given his conversations with others, particularity with Ipek, he came across as someone so lack of self-agency in understanding himself and others. He looked at every woman in the singular axis of ""beauty""; he does not really enquire anything other than being a beautiful object to bring ""happiness"" to his domestic life. In most people, he clearly objectifies individuals into certain types. In his encounter, everybody talks in lengthy, repetitive statement of their beliefs.. (3) Necip: one of the most irritating characters who talks on the most unnatural way. Or perhaps Ka recreated these conversations through his own mental filter. Or the authors.. (4) The actions of people make very little sense, largely because the author does not offer any insights to their motives. They are just jumping in and out of the stories like magic tricks. Modern styled writing or not, it is very hard pressed to admit any readerly pleasure in encountering these characters.. (5) The philosophic discussion and snow scenes are the most enjoyable segments. But such ruminating segments do not come easily nor coherent. The ""love"" interests of Ka are the most irritation aspect of this novel. Nothing shows up this man as an arrogant, moody, shallow person than his romantic imaginations.. *** Notes as of Jan 2014","Jun 20, 2012"
329875,Liza,"I read this book on a plane leaving people I loved in a city I had once thought would be my own. I was basically ready to be moved by anything, and this book still didn't do it. The last flight I was on the person next to me was also reading it, so it seems to be a plane book. Snow, snow, snow, snow. Yes, it can symbolize a lot of things. But where are you going with it, after all? And usually I like to think I can tell, but in this case I wasn't sure whether the failing was mine or the book's. Or translator's? Anyway, I found all this snow talk pretty tedious and twee. And then, well, where to even start. So there is this novel, where we are being told that the central character is writing these absolutely sublime poems, but we don't get the poems themselves, except for lines here and there that don't sound very good at all. Are we supposed to believe it? I didn't. And there are lots of things that I find interesting, like framing and fragments, that this book seems to play with, but the play is not quite playful enough and nor does it seem (to me) profound. And there was a lot of doubling, tripling, a lot of things you could bring up in a book club discussion or something, but why? Ka as a main character seems, with a few exceptions, neither like a plausible person or a meaningful conceit. There were some moments when Snow seemed to point somewhere more intriguing, but so much of it read to me like a performance that was phoned in, like markers that said I meant to put something better here, but didn't. (Still, I feel like I could go on and on about it, which is weird for a book I didn't like very much.) Basically, I don't recommend it unless you can't find anything else in the airport bookstore.","Nov 10, 2007"
13716226,Murtaza ,"This is a great novel about an isolated eastern Anatolian city in the 1990s, which attempts to provide a microcosm of the various changes that continue to occur in Turkish society at large. While it is an explicitly political novel the author also does a very good job of exploring the individual melancholy of the people who populate his book, as well as creating archetypes of a variety of different groups of people in contemporary Turkey (Islamists, Republicans, Kurdish nationalists etc) that give an insight into who they are, where they come from, how they think. One constant theme is how much Europe plays into everyones consciousness, whether out of an overt desire to become European, angry denunciations of those who allegedly devote their lives to aping Europeans, or just a general need to be noticed and heard by Europe, the country of Turkey is always seen by its inhabitants as being reflected through a European lens in some way. Looking at the country's contemporary history it is easy to see why this is the case, as indeed it is the case of many countries that had a traumatic encounter with the West in the 20th century, and this psychological relationship is illustrated very powerfully here.. In addition to its subject matter, the book also happens to beautifully written and evocative. I don't know if everyone would appreciate as much as I did, given the particular historical and political bent of the subject, but I sincerely think it stands alone as a great novel regardless of context.","Sep 12, 2013"
29766292,Soumen Daschoudhury,"Lately I’ve been inadvertently reading a lot about God. Graham Greene’s God, Iris Murdoch’s God, Jordan Peterson’s God and now Ka’s and Kars’s versions of God. Yes, versions. Kars is a city in Turkey and Ka is a Turkish poet and this is their story.. For some reason the story and its people have left me irritated. I don’t like them. At all!. And not ‘for some reason’; I know, I know why. They aren’t simply flawed in their beliefs like most beings are; they are ugly in their narrow minded thoughts and uglier in their actions; they want to see the world burn in the name of religion and God.. Ka’s Kars is a city you probably didn’t know about and when you do know, you don’t want to know anymore about. Nothing really happens there except for snowing. Nothing constructive, I mean. And yet people are so obsessed there with their beliefs. And when it thaws, and people are out of their frozen inertia, the ugliness drips with the thawing.. The kind of fundamentalism mentioned is so tiring - towards God, towards religion and yet it exists. And these so called fundamentalists and their beliefs in God and religion in their created capacities, in fact strengthen your thoughts that they are the creations of men. Created capacities for sure because God is a veil they hide behind, a convenience for their immorality and disgusting fanatical thoughts and acts.. God is a favourite of the idle and the disturbed; he, not He, has nothing worthwhile to do. The hard working person, the intellectual doesn’t need to talk about God all the time, he too needs assurance but he knows He’s there, if you do believe at all. All about the people of Kars is ‘Us and Them’; us is them and them is the West. And the West for them is a world of intellectuals and infidels, and intellectualism is atheism. Says who? Says they. And yet they are so concerned that the West disparages them, laughs at them, and finds them to be nobodies. Grow up you wonderful people of this wonderful city; probably the West doesn’t even know you exist! And why are you so insecure and unhappy when you so strongly believe in your God; why should what the West think of you matter? It’s a farce, it’s a farce!. I guess this hypocrisy stems from the basic needs of humanity not being met, from Maslow’s pyramid of human needs. The city of Kars and its people are in poverty, a jobless dump where the youth and adolescents are idling their time away; what better thing to do than to fight for God then and to kill and destroy in his name. And not just kill thy neighbor, annihilate the world if possible – spread the word of God! I’ve come to realize that the things you hate are actually the things you most love or crave for. And most of the characters have an insidious affinity for the West but just can’t be them because they’re not supposed to, allowed to, because you are not allowed to love something you detest. And the internal conflict in their heads, a strong hatred emerging from helplessness creates their own inferno and they don’t want to burn alone.. Movement in this story by Orhan Pamuk where he himself writes about his friend Ka after his death, starts and ends with the changing laws of girls’ suicides in Kars and around for not being allowed to wear a headscarf. It took me a while to actually understand what the big deal of a headscarf was and how it was related to the girls’ suicides and then I realized. And it was a wow moment!. As a character in the book says; the world will grow in leaps and bounds and make technological advances while we are stuck with head-scarves and religion. Thinking logically or intellectually is an abuse in such a society where everyone knows everything about religion and God and good and evil and what you should do and more importantly what you shouldn’t; probably more than the God they believe in.. They are all shamelessly naked and exposed and yet they care about the wearing of a headscarf. Your religion, your religious books and your God don’t really advocate infidelity, deceit, hatred, do they? Ipek, a divorcee, who Ka is madly, rather lustily in love with, who he considers and portrays as nothing less than Aphrodite herself, sleeps with her husband’s friend whom he reveres. Her sister vies for the same man, is sleeping with him as well. And this man is a terrorist who thinks he has all the answers. They call him Blue and the sisters think he’s is truthful and heroic and just and doing the work of God. Just! Work of God! What’s that? Satiating envious vying blood sisters at the same time while their imbecile of a father is busy talking about politics – Is this the call for freedom? And freedom from what? And though the story tries to flavor a woman’s plight, I don’t see Ipek as anything but a selfish woman. She’s cunning enough to make love to Ka even though she’s not in love with him; she just wants to mislead him, she’s still in love with Blue. And these girls have opinions on wearing and the removal of head scarves! A fundamentalist, a fugitive sleeping with two sisters at the same time; how does your God allow that? God is your convenience and nothing else.. And then there’s Sunay Zaim, the theatre virtuoso, a crazy artist who’s ready to die for his art and beliefs and he does, yet not before deceitfully and ingeniously causing a military coup in the snowy city. He dies like the suicide girls; for pride they say. Pride for what you worthless creatures, for what? It’s a puzzle you don’t want to solve; just want to throw the pieces away and not think again.. “Don’t write what you see about us in your book”, a character tells Orhan while he’s leaving the city. Why not? Why aren’t you uncomfortable in your skin? Why don’t you act the way you want to be then; why hide behind this shroud of the unknown? Why do you need someone else’s assurance? If you yourself have so many conflicts within yourself, then how come you have such strong opinions about God and religion?. Just believing and trusting in God isn’t enough in Kars; you have to prove it every day else you are termed an atheist. You might be a rapist, a murderer but if you climb the cemented or stone steps of the house of God, you’re a believer. Here God isn’t important anymore but what you think of God takes precedence. No wonder they make such heartless terrorists. Kars doesn’t need God; it needs jobs and things to keep themselves busy. They need to clean their houses and city first before trying to build the Garden of Eden.. I’ve got to confess. I kept reading the book till the end because I derived a sadistic pleasure from hating them. Not healthy, I know; probably that shows my current state of mind.","Aug 19, 2020"
537205,Meredith Watts,"I confess I knew next to nothing about Turkey before picking up this book to read for my bookclub. Pamuk has won the Nobel Prize in Literature and this book garnered many awards, so it seemed a good place to start.. The book is not an easy read. The protagonist is the ex-pat poet Ka; or, is the protagonist really his friend who is narrating the tale, incidentally named Orhan? Girls in rural Turkey, whose lives are diminished by grinding poverty, begin to want an education and a way out, but at the same time, they want to wear headscarves, which is anathema to the secularist regime of Turkey, which is maintained by the Army. The Army mounts coups every few decades to make sure that Turkey does not return to being a Muslim state. So no one is surprised when an armed rebellion breaks out and Muslim activists start agitating. Other characters include the beautiful Ipek who married another poet, and had an affair with a radical. Kat is mesmerized by her, or is he only mesmerized by the idea of regaining his halcyon youth in Instanbul? Then there are the boys at a local religious school -- who struggle mightily with the idea that God might not exist, and whose lives are tormented by the denial of a sexual outlet -- a black dog, secularist intellectuals who are ineffectual and bitter, and of course the snow itself.. I loved this book. I still feel like I understand the news coming out of Turkey, only because I've read ""Snow.""","Oct 31, 2007"
141875,Brinda,"Rarely does a book come around that ends up being so much more than a book. 'Snow' is not a novel, it is an experience. Pamuk is unafraid to challenge his readers by forcing them to question the perspective of his narrator, the veracity of events, turning the idea of truth itself on its head (I think this is one of the finest examples of novels that could be read as a critique of modern media). It is beautifully written, astoundingly intelligent in how he manages to - through his characters -create brilliant arguments/scenarios both for and against secularism/fundamentalism. But yet through it all, you get the sense that ultimately, no matter how politically charged characters appear, that they -- like us -- are all just trying to find love, meaning and dignity in their lives -- some just choose to manifest those desires in different ways. I would recommend this to people who have patience and some time, or a book club to hash it all out in the end. Sections appear to drag, but only because this was a unique reading experience for me and I found that I needed more focus than usual to truly get the most 'bang' out of the experience. I wanted a week off to read it, with no major distraction (which of course I didn't have), because this is one of those books that truly takes flight if you let its mesmerizing sense of quiet and solitude take over.","Sep 30, 2007"
15879,Jack,"Man, if I could drop a 3.75 bomb on this tome, I'd do it for sure. It was pretty uninteresting until the last quarter of the book when suddenly, Pamuk becomes this engaging, web-spinning, insect-sucking spider of a novelist. I just mean that it gets good at the end.. Pamuk describes things exceptionally evocatively and in the case of 'Snow,' it is actually quite beautifully executed. Maybe some people get dragged down in the descriptions (my coworker did, but she read it in Turkish) but they are worth the effort.. Pamuk also manages to take on a number of themes and incorporates a huge number of personalities in this book. So while the book is set in Kars, a forgotten provincial town on the end of the world (or the edge of Turkey,) a huge assortment of characters pass in and out of the book.. I guess you could sort of tell that this guy Pamuk is a great writer (won the Nobel Prize... ehh.. maybe that was a stretch and then again, maybe not. I'm just not sure what a Nobel writer is like... Anyway, I digress) and it was definitely a good read... but... I just feel like somethings don't come together for a full 4 stars. (In my personal ranking system, five stars = life-changing.)","Mar 02, 2007"
1032341,bobherzog zog,"Again, Pamuk is dealing with the major issues of Turkey (and, basically, half the world): East v. West, modernization/globalization, the rise of radical Islam and it's suppression and possible role in democracy. Although, this novel features Azeris, Armenians, Kurds, Islamists, suicides over wearing head scarves, charming terrorist leaders and simple terrorist soldiers, Turkish nationalists and securalists, and plenty of murder and theater in Eastern Anatolia while dealing with the above-mentioned issues, somehow it isn't that exciting. At certain points it even feels like he is pushing certain elements at very specific times in the plot, like genre fiction or a noir film (by page 75 they to kiss; by page 150 they have sex). And, of course, the girl is beautiful.. But, the most alarming aspect is that Pamuk's prose is kind of pedantic and the dialogue feels stiff at times. That's not him.. I guess this review sounds a lot worse than my rating, which is a more reasonable estimation of the work. It's actually really solid stuff. But, after reading other Pamuk I expect a lot and this isn't as good. Read ""The Black Book"" before this one it's a lot better.","May 10, 2008"
5079061,Ivo Crnkovic-Rubsamen,"Snow is a lame book. Lame is usually not a very informative way to describe a book, but it really fits in this case. If you are familiar with someone who uses the word lame on a daily basis, you'll know it conveys the sense that the subject is try-hard-but-fail, boring inspiration for apathy. Snow is absolutely that. The language is intricate but totally trite. We get it, rural turkish cities covered in snow are depressing but beautiful, we don't need the character to rediscover this 50000 times. The plot is simultaneously basic enough to be stultifyingly boring and complicated enough to be off-putting. The end result, a plot that's serious enough to be unpredictable, but then again maybe you can't predict because you just don't actually give 2 shits. Then there's the 'raw' passages. Clearly, at some point an editor read this pile of intellectual gruel and told Pamuk that his protagonist doesn't emote in a manner that the reader can feel. Pamuk went home that night and slammed out the two sex scenes and the part about porn, which feel totally incongruous and forced. Saved from 1-star by the sometimes decent language.","Jul 19, 2011"
107267,Ann,"This book really dragged on and on and there are far too many characters that I didn't care about one bit. Actually, I can't think of a single character I cared for. There were a few passages that were interesting for their philosophical merit, but nothing more. I was somewhat interested in the absurdity of some of the religious arguments, but this was overshadowed by an empty love story.. Things I hated:. *Ka is writing poetry throughout - he writes something like 19 perfect poems. But we never see any of them because the manuscript is lost. I'm pretty sure the author just doesn't know how to write poetry.. *The author inserts himself into the story and I find that incredibly annoying. It didn't serve a purpose.. (Note: I counted this as read and not abandoned because I read 3/4 of the book and then skipped ahead to the last chapter...and was underwhelmed. I read the wikipedia entry just to make sure I didn't miss anything and I didn't. I was sure there had to be more plot or development or something in the 100 pages I skipped, but no.)","Sep 22, 2009"

I cannot hear another word about snow or black dogs. The fact that the writer keeps telling the reader what will happen next, long before it happens (""the eye, that would be shattered by a bullet in matter of hours!"") doesn't help.. Usually I read until page 100, and decide if the book is worth the time and effort to finish. Usually books are. I did the same for this book. Although the book itself didn't prove to be that interesting yet I decided to keep reading because, after all, this writer received a Nobel price in literature. Surely, it would get better! Surely this book would blow me away! It didn't! Not at all. So if you really. must. start reading this book, I recommend you to evaluate it after 100 pages.

I feel very sympathetic to those that hate this book, it was very easy to consider the possibility that I may hate this book. A little perverse in its willingness to be unfriendly, it was really a struggle for me to finish once its explicit how unlikeable the main dude is. You need that compromised, divided character in the center, though, to give weak insight into this world driven by ideals and personalities equally noble and petty. The only reliable perspective has to come from someone both inside and outside, someone neutral when neutrality is clearly an immoral position.

5983822,Dan,"this book greatly disappointed me, though by a feted writer and touching on vital, visceral themes: desire, the politics of violence, islamicism v secularism. it did three things well. the friendliness and brutality of small, poor towns is captured. pamuk also recounts well how in a sea of uncertainty and confusion, intense beliefs spring from boredom and frustration. he has time for the representatives of various political beliefs. finally, there is a compelling scene leading to the murder of a teacher, in which dialogue weaving a spell.. but many more aspects made it difficult to read - poverty of description; a plot driven almost entirely by men's attitude to women, combined with flat female characters, idealised as objects of desire; Ka, our protagonist, in perpetual and boring concern about what others might think of him. i can see how the book offended many in turkey, and i'm sure it is not only due to politics. a frustrating, melancholy farce.","Oct 31, 2011"
85593379,Arnab Chakraborty,"This was my first introduction to Pamuk, and I must say that while in some ways it left me a little disappointed, in others it was quite beautiful in its evocation of the city Kars. It was disappointing insofar as it seemed like a check list of postmodern trickery; the experienced reader of the postmodern detective novel can see the twists and turns coming from a mile away. Pamuk's true achievement in this book is not the deployment of postmodernism so much as its induction into a political fold.. Having said that, what's up with the translation?! I'm positive someone messed up somewhere. Unless Pamuk was being deliberately theatrical and repetitive in his descriptions of how people reveal themselves emotionally. The language also felt a little uneven: descriptive and truly poetic in sections while laughably simple in others, I had to stop and remind myself that I was reading a Nobel Laureate every now and then.","Sep 29, 2018"

The more serious aspects of the plot (Turkey's history, the suicides..) took a backseat to the narrator's obsession with Ipek.. 4. The narrator is a famous poet, but we never read his poetry because his manuscripts happen to disappear. Gasp! Surprise! Cop-out?. 5. Statements like this about Ipek: ""He'd forgotten how beautiful she was during their university days, and now, suddenly reminded, he felt slightly nervous in her presence. Yes, exactly -- that's how beautiful she was."" Now repeat similar statements continuously throughout the rest of the 400 pages.. SO GLAD THIS BOOK IS OVER.","Sep 23, 2010"

Museum of Innocence. ?) . . . - The ludicrous love declarations and bad sex scenes. . .- The ubiquitous Turkish teahouses with their obligatory portraits of Ataturk and portraits of Swiss landscapes! . . . - The farcical over-the-top elements; sometimes I had to laugh. . . - Could Pamuk have removed the scaffolding (the putative story as told to the author-of-Orhan Pamuk's-novels), and made this a tighter story?","Apr 11, 2011"
641491,Ollie,"I really wanted to like this novel but I found it hard to care 200 pages in. Pamuk may have won the Nobel for Literature and carry impressive quotes by Margaret Atwood on his cover, but he's a long way off from being able to tell a gripping story or create characters one cares for. Unless the fault lies with the translation?. It starts off well enough, with an expatriated poet returning to Turkey from Germany - in particular to a small town where he's been given the task by a newspaper to find out why so many girls are committing suicide. However, this is all just a ruse by Pamuk to question political Islam and contrast it with Turkey's secularist state, all done under a lot of heavy allusions to snowflakes and poetry. The politics and glaringly obvious metaphors just don't sit well enough beside the fiction. It's all very worthy and topical, but just not fun.","Mar 05, 2012"
1432709,Julie,"This book was a bit of a roller coaster ride for me. It starts out with the main character, Ka, an exiled Turkish poet returning to the small town of Kars to investigate the suicides of the 'scarf-girls' - girls who due to a new law are no longer allowed to wear their head scarves in school. The stories told by these girls were sad and completely drew me in. But... it turns out that the story of the headscarf girls is just a ruse and Ka's journey back to Turkey is really to revisit his first love, Ipek, who has recently left her husband who has become a religious fundamentalist. So, forget the head-scarf girls and get drawn into the story of a romance with a lot of complications. But even then, the plot changes again and finally I felt that I just couldn't really get drawn into the new twists and subplots.

At first I was intrigued by the suicides and thought the book was heading toward ""solving"" them, but that didn't really pan out. This really did not make me want to read any of Pamuk's other writings. On the plus side, the chapters are relatively short which breaks up the monotony. I didn't find the protagonist, Ka, as unbearable as other reviewers; actually he kind of appealed to me, as a depressed, hopelessly bereft man who missed being mothered.

There is religion for the devout as well as for the unsure. There is rationalism for the non-believer as well as for the western secularist. There are different kinds of love - desolate, aggressive, dreamy, childish, destructive, habitual, longing, duty-bound, and many more..

Very quickly, the reader and subject's positions are reversed, and one is forced to confront their own position in relation to the people of Kars. We will never know them (them as 'other' to our occidental position, but also implicitly they do not know us, despite our looming presence through identity politics). You probably won't like anyone in this story, but at the same time, a more honest reader might confront their own demons of how they construct the enemy. In the end this reads to me more of an existential expression of the all too common human failings (bigotry, myopia, the abuse of power), the only things we all seem to have in common universally.","Sep 10, 2017"

2711152,Paras Abbasi,"I picked up Snow by Orhan Pamuk after I read the essay ‘The Last Train Trip before Everything Changed’ by Lauren Markham where she talks about solitude, snow and finding reasons to write during the pandemic. In the essay, while Markham drew her inspiration to write from Orhan Pamuk’s Snow during her train journey quoting the lines, “As he watched the snow fall outside his window as slowly and silently as the snow in a dream, the traveler fell into a long-desired, long-awaited reverie: cleansed by memories of innocence and childhood, he succumbed to optimism and dared to believe himself at home in this world”, for me the essay was a godsend. I needed to read this book.. Snow by Pamuk, one of the greatest writers from Turkey, is a lovely mixture of ethereal beauty of snow, how it makes one feel, and the convoluted Turkish political landscape during nineties. The book is set in Kars, a north-eastern town of Turkey near the Armenian border, laced with poverty, unemployment and political factions consisting of Kurdish support, Armenian ideologists, Islamists, Secularists and the military. Ka, the self-exiled poet to Germany returns to Istanbul and makes his journey to the snow covered Kars in an effort to find his love interest from college who is living with her father after divorce. But the overt reason to announce his arrival in Kars is to cover the election campaign of Kars and to investigate the reason behind the surge in number of suicides by head-scarved girls.. The book layers and un-layers into understanding the politics of a small town while giving an insight into the so-called secular politics of Turkey in 90s; plays smartly with the idea of how people change their sides owing to changing self-interests albeit hiding under the pretexts of greater ideas such as politics, religion and greater good; and portrays love as an emotion only felt for trivial reasons—beauty, envy, head-scarf, political gain, lust—that I wonder if such portrayal was intentional and is sometimes even true. Amidst a heavy set plot of Machiavellian politics of power-hunger, theatrics, secularism versus Islamism, suicides of religious girls versus brainwashing of young boys, is snow—white, clear and fluffy, like a thick blanket engulfing the town into a beauty, appreciated equally from afar and within. It works as a fortification of Kars from the state, to let it settle its problems inwardly until the snow melts and the town opens again.. The book, originally in Turkish, is a translation by Maureen Freely, which makes me appreciate the craft of translation even more. For it’s extremely difficult to do justice with literary works, keeping the same essence and yet mesmerize the readers as if they were reading the original piece. It’s a shame the translators often disappear under the shadows of original pieces as mere mediators between the author and readers, when they are the source of disseminating great works of art universally.. Snow is a long read but totally worth a reread for its enthralling literature.","Apr 29, 2020"
1457797,Katelyn Sherman,"I agree with Ryan's review, except that I didn't have his high expectations going into it. Therefore, it did not disappoint me and I enjoyed the book slightly more. Still, I agree it felt boring, it was slow, not really believable that the poet from out of town would be suddenly trusted as the main messenger between seemingly highly important political figures in the coup.. I did feel more understanding of the main character, the aforementioned poet, because I accepted that perhaps it's due to both the writing style and to the poet's personality to be a bit indifferent, a bit dry, a bit hard. The poet is described at the end of the novel by a prostitute he frequented in Germany as (paraphrasing here a little but not much) being a big baby, in constant need of mothering and yet shying away from being mothered because he was afraid. I found this description incredibly accurate; he is idiotically insecure about everything, afraid of everything, and immature with love. It shows that the author is aware of how his character is being portrayed, which was a relief to me and my understanding of the character.. About Islamic culture and Turkish culture, I feel I learned small things along the way, without taking firm hold of anything in the book to be hard truth. No, of course it's a novel written in a poetic fashion about one small town in Turkey and a fictionalized political situation. Like Ryan, I didn't like the black and white, polarized depictions of THE WEST versus ISLAMIC COUNTRIES, but maybe that is the way some young religious youths see ""the West"" contrary to themselves, especially because none of them have ever BEEN to the Europe or America, so what do they know? Everyone seemed really confused and immature about their feelings and faith and politics, yet they could speak movingly about their religious experiences that bring them close to God.. I still liked it and I'll still be willing to try out another of his books. He was awarded the Novel Prize for Literature and he is a gifted writer.

The narrator and author's understanding of the relationship between men and women represented very little of the perspective I have as a woman born in America in 1954. That's probably not a bad thing. I had to think about my own perspective (and appreciate it anew). But I didn't have to understand all the politics to understand the human vanity and tragicomedy behind them. Also I recognized and enjoyed the book's sly and funny exposure of writers and their vanity. This was a constant theme, perhaps the heart of the story. In some ways, Snow reminded me of 101 Years of Solitude, but without the lightness and hopefulness of magical realism--which I missed. This is the kind of book I am very glad I read, a bit more so than when I was reading it.","Jun 09, 2019"
102271,Cynthia Paschen,"Ka drove me nuts. When he gets the urge to write a poem, he stops everything and writes, noting that others are watching him write. When he shares a poem with the object of his affections, he asks her six times if the poem is beautiful.. Ipek, the object of Ka's affections, is beautiful. This is enough for Ka, but it was not enough for me. I wanted to know more of Ipek, and of the suicide girls.. I read this because at my friend Janet's funeral, her book group books were laid out, each stuffed with clippings and photocopies of reviews and author interviews. We were encouraged to take a book home. Janet, I hope you enjoyed ""Snow"" more than I did.","May 14, 2018"
22881657,Robert Miranda,"4.5 stars. I am unsure what to make of this novel, but perhaps Fazil’s words, simply spoken on the last page, explain why: “No one could possibly understand us from so far away.” A beautiful, absorbing, alienating, theatrical, and thoughtful work.","Aug 19, 2020"
1758482,Renate,"What can I say about this unusual, exquisite and political novel? I had to read it slowly. I tried to understand it, only to be told on the penultimate page:. ""No one could understand from so far away"". . Well then, what can, or may, I say. ""from far away"". ?. I can see that this novel may not be everyone's cup of tea. But I liked it, even though it wasn't an easy read. It contained so many words of wisdom that I wanted to underline in the text.. This isn't a book you would read for its plot:- An lonely man goes back to his home town to find love. There he finds love but he also finds a revolution. He responds at times of crisis by writing poetry. That is about it. Oh and oddly the author himself pops in as a character cum narrator every now and then.. For me, Pamuk simply painted a picture of a typical revolution. This one is literally ""staged"" in a backwater somewhere in Turkey, a place that used to thrive but has now fallen on hard times. The ""revolution"" is a deadly farce, orchestrated by a megalomaniac, executed by thugs. Innocents suffer and die. People's lives are changed, but not for the better. Most of the ordinary people just try to stay out of the way, watching television.. I like how in each chapter, together with Ka, the poet, we meet someone who gives us another point of view. As one reads further and further into the novel, the tapestry that is painted of Turkey's troubles and politics gets ever more complex. I found myself drawn into and caring about the characters even though they were hard to understand. My favourite chapter in the novel is a political meeting where various characters explain their views.. This is one of those books that left me with a longing for a conversation with the author. I was fortunate to be able to attended a talk given by Pamuk in London, just before starting to read this novel. Pamuk told us that some writers, such as. Dostoevsky. , work with a verbal imagination. Others, like himself,. Proust. and. Tolstoy. , write in pictures. About this novel ""Snow"" he mentioned that the novel was set in Kars, simply because its geography allows it to be a place where a snow storm could cut the town off from the rest of Turkey. The novel is about the anxiety caused by being both modern but also belonging to Turkey. We were reminded of how the Iranian revolution had made the entire middle east nervous.. The political conflict in Turkey was brought right into the meeting. Pamuk had to defuse some questions of an angry woman who tried to exploit the meeting to draw attention to a hunger strike going on in Turkey at the time. And then, just yesterday I spotted this incident in the news.. A real life event that reminds of the fictitious one in the novel. .","Nov 04, 2012"
2422887,Sarah,"Second reading, this time actually started in Kars... and finished a month later in Iraq. Who has time to read?. I am as beguiled and mystified by this book as I am by Kars itself. It's cursed with two unreliable, unlikeable narrators (Ka the poet, and Orhan the novelist), and there is far too much of Ka and others rushing around in a political-thriller style, having unexplained thoughts and doing unjustified things in the manner of the madman in a Russian novel. I understand the politics - or rather, the mood - a little better now, having spent some time in Eastern Turkey, but a lot of it I can't fully appreciate. With the Kurds no more than a fringe element in the book (as, it seems, in Kars today) the basic tensions between pro-Ataturk, military secularists and the Islamic reformers are clear enough, but it seems every character occupies a particular and unique point in the matrix of beliefs and reasons and it's not easy to work out where they're really coming from.. It's difficult to keep a grip on the arc of the story, and Ka is truly annoying with his selfishness, naivete, petulance and desire to dominate Ipek ('silk', cf Pamuk, 'cotton'); but still the premise is inspired, with this remote, trouble city cut off by a snowstorm, which both allows for an unlikely coup to take place and creates a mood of unreality, suspended time, dreams and nostalgia. There are layers here that are only just starting to unfold for me: the town is Kars, snow in Turkish is 'kar', the poet is Ka and the neon letter that flashes both outside his room when things start to unravel for him, and at the spot in Frankfurt where he meets his end, is K... what does this all mean? And the friendly station dog has a charcoal coat, same as Ka. And on and on. I suspect this is a complex allegory about the state of Turkey, poised between Islamicism and Europe, insecure, childish, violent at times, generous, selfish and sentimental. Ka is Turkey? Snow is life? Ipek is the eternal feminine? Who knows.. It feels like a very traditional, complex, fully realised masterpiece. And Kars is recognisably its strange, difficult self. I'm sticking with five stars.","Feb 13, 2010"
1753018,Paula Koneazny,"Melancholy and fatality pervade this novel. Here, poetic structure is a six-sided snowflake: reason, imagination, and memory forming the three axes. Ka, a well-known Turkish poet and the central character in the novel, returns to Turkey for a brief visit. He has been a political exile in Germany for many years. Specifically, he returns to Kars, an economically depressed and politically divided city that once was a hub of Russian, Armenian and Turkish culture. He has come to Kars ostensibly to report on a series of suicides by ""head scarf girls."" Whether these suicides were personal or political in nature remains undecided, as does the motivation for all action and inaction in the novel. Ka, not having written any new poems in years, writes 19 poems while in Kars, a group of poems that will comprise a lost manuscript entitled ""Snow."" These poems come to him all of a piece as if transmitted from ""above"" or ""outside"" himself. Ka, despite himself, becomes implicated in a weekend coup literally ""staged"" by an actor in cahoots with rogue members of the army and security forces, as well as mere hoodlums. The coup targets some religious high school boys and a mesmerizing Islamist rebel named Blue and results in 29 deaths. Events that seem to take place over an extended period of time actually transpire in a matter of 3 days during which the city is snowed in and cut off from the outside world. During these 3 days, Ka writes his 19 poems and experiences both bliss and fatal jealousy in the arms of the beautiful Ipek, one of Blue's former lovers. Midway through the novel, we learn that the narrator is a famous novelist and friend of Ka's who recapitulates Ka's journey thanks to Ka's journals. The journals describe the writing of the missing poems and all the events of Ka's weekend in Kars, except for the one missing hour that ultimately determines Ka's fate. At the end of the day, life can't be sorted out. Snow is always falling and obscuring our view. In this novel, as in all his writing, Pamuk's prose is mysterious and evocative.","Nov 26, 2008"
1627591,Robert,"Orhan Pamuk's 2001 novel Snow begins in a register reminiscent of Kafka's The Castle, which is to say the protagonist, who goes by the name Ka, arrives in a desolate town where snow seems perpetual and every twist in the tale involves another mystery.. Ka is a Turkish poet, returned to Turkey from exile in Frankfurt, Germany, and traveling to Kars to write a story about why Islamist girls in Kars are committing suicide. He encounters a place tumultuous with cultural, ethnic and political clashes. There are the Islamists (the girls wear headscarves, the boys congregate in some kind of Turkish madrassa), the Kurds, the secularists, the military, the vestiges of Armenian and Russian influences, and a range of characters representing these groups and forces.. As the novel proceeds, it becomes more Dostoevskian. Think of The Idiot--there are holy fools here--and think of Demons--there are revolutionaries in abundance. An overarching tension is Turkey's ambivalence about Europe, also true in Dostoevsky's Russia.. Running deeper than the political and cultural scenario, we also encounter a double, or triple, or quadruple, love interest that ignites Ka's long dormant poetic imagination, although we hear about his Kars poem cycle (to be called Snow) without having a chance to read it.. This is a funny, moving, sweet, and horrifying novel held together by a narrator (it turns out to be Pamuk himself), who reminds me of the chatty, insightful narrator intermittently present in The Brothers Karamazov. The narrator knows things it would be difficult to know, but ultimately he documents his discoveries fairly persuasively and succumbs at the same time to the same beautiful women as Ka.. There's buffoonery, mockery, sincerity, and satire in Snow. It's a rewarding read, fun all along the way, although at about the midpoint Pamuk's literary heroes seem to drop away and he barges forward on his own, jamming the improbable into the impossible with deadpan skill.","Apr 16, 2016"
6159628,Melissa,"I wanted to like this book, but it took me two months to complete. I would get to the end of a chapter and find other things to do. While I liked the overall plot, the characters were a little too flat/shallow to fully get into and the prose was far too wordy on non-essential things like the brand of band-aid, the menus, shop names in Frankfurt, too-much-yet-too-little info about ""Ataturk"", etc. I also didn't really like the main character, Ka. He was obviously a damaged person with unclear mother issues and unexplained paranoia, but little sympathy could be mustered for his single-minded tampering with events/people to get what he wanted and leave. I think Necip was the only character I really liked and Blue was the only one I could see clearly, in all his layers - and he was supposed to be mysterious, I think.. However, the author did a good job of portraying both sides of the religious/political/gender-centric headscarf question and seemed to stay neutral which reinforces the ""it's complicated"" aspect of the issue.. After googling ""Kars, Turkey"" images, I was shocked to see that it's much larger than what I was envisioning, which was a very small town where it might be hard to hide - and it's also known for cowherding, cheese and honey. (???) Introducing that aspect could have made for some much more colorful characters. I would love to see what Nuri Bilge Ceylan (Turkish director) could do with this. His films are cinematic and somber. He would probably be able to pare down the excessive text and dialog to the barest minimum and really nail the tense atmosphere that was lost in wordiness. Not sure what he could even do with the bohemian theater troupe turned political oppressors/liberators. That part seemed a little Moulin-Rouge-ish. A more serious, straightforward political confrontation would have held my attention better - and been more realistic. (???)","Dec 18, 2016"
55711,Duc,"If the contents of the book didn't happen in the real world, this book could be read as a work of Science Fiction or even extreme fiction. Unfortunately, the ideas and practices of what is written happen in the real world. Even though, this part of the world is so remote from my reality, that it seems almost like a science fiction: such issue as whether or not to wear a head scarf, face cover in public or school. Cables are strung and hooked up ad hock through out the neighbor hood just to catch the live broad cast of a television show. It is almost a work of dystopia but this is the real world that Orhan Pamuk is writing about.. When reading about exotic locales, I'm often reminded of the works of Paul Bowls. He was an American who went to live in Tangiers and wrote novels about those foreign places. There is certainly an element of expatriation and distance as the narrator Ka goes back to his place of birth to explore his past relationships. While, Bowls explores cultural difference and the dangers of mixing white culture with the natives, Orphan's work takes on political and moral issues. He mixes the issue of suicide, religion, and morals with a political act. This political act seems like a fashion choice in some parts of the world, but a major rebellious act in this region. It's an all too real a premise: whether or not to be allowed to wear a head scarf and whether or not to kill oneself if one is not allowed to do so.. If it was imaged as a work of fiction or even science fiction, it would have been brilliant. Although it happens in the real world, it is even more frightening. This is a case where life is stranger then fiction and reporting straight from it with honesty and being able to see the concept of the novel in its simplicity is an amazing work of recognition.","Apr 21, 2008"
3105441,Nate's Bookgroup,"Ten Reasons I (strongly) disliked this book:. 1. The author made himself a character in his story. I just don't like it when they do that. I always wonder if they had writers-block and couldn't invent a fictional character to take the reins.. 2. Snowflake diagram of poetry. I'll say no more.. 3. The main character is a whiny, infantile, grown man who falls in love with every woman he encounters. As is the narrator whose name happens to be the same as the author, and two of the young men who play huge parts in what little of the plot I cared for.. 4. In the same paragraph the female lead character is described as seething in hatred and laughing adoringly at said whiny, infantile grown man. Bad writing, bad translation or intentional?. 5. This story had no cohesion. Things just happened to the main character without much exposition. The exposition that did come was mainly philosophical and seemingly tangential. And if I have to read another sentence about whether a Muslim woman should wear a scarf or not or how beautiful and terrifying snow can be, I will go batty.. 6. I did not understand the motivations behind most of the characters' actions. I admit this may be because I'm ignorant to the social intricacies of the Turkish realm. But this book did not help me to care.. 7. As a fellow poet, I hated that the main character wrote 19 poems through out the novel, but the reader never got to read any of them. This point is explained in the story, but it still bugged me.. 8. The author inexplicably tried his hardest to make the novel seem like a biography even though A NOVEL is featured prominently on the cover.. 9. From this novel I am to presume that every Turkish woman is profoundly beautiful and that Turkish men can only drag themselves after these creatures in the hope of being noticed.","Jan 03, 2010"
2744544,Robert,"Over here in Malta Pamuk is big, his novels sell constantly and he props up in conversations quite a bit. Mainly due to his views and allegations. But I’ve never really bothered to read i his books. I knew they would be constantly in print so now finally having a chance to read him I can see why he’s liked.. Ka is an exiled poet and is returning to his hometown of Kars in order to investigate a group of women who have committed suicide. However later on in the book we find out that here’s here to rekindle a relationship with one of his ex lovers. As the title suggest Kars is a victim of heavy snowfalls.. This whole plot device is simply a maguffin to what is a complex political thriller which tackles the westernization of Turkey and various movements to restore the Muslim culture. Ka at first sides wants Turkey to be westernized but as the novel proceeds he becomes torn between the two ideals.. Eventually Ka decision’s effect his destiny – and others greatly. Which leads to an unforgetable climax.. There are many great things about Snow. Ka himself is a complex character who’s relationships with other protagonists shape his future. The way snow is depicted to be as menacing as the city of Kars.The amount of memorable scenes are numerous. Even the narrative technique is original (I cannot give this away though).. Unfortunately I was not able to fully appreciate the novel. There are times when the translation was stodgy, which meant the flow of Snow was at turtle’s pace. There are times when things are lost in translation and the novel suffers from this. This aside and you’ve got the brainiest espionage/social commentary written in the 00’s (well let’s include Bolano’s 2666 as well.)","Jul 26, 2011"
2403581,Patricia,"This story started off great for me. The storyline was interesting and a mystery was promised, and I was deeply drawn to it the first few chapters. Snow is the story of a poet, Ka, who returns to his native home in Turkey after being politically exiled in Germany for several years. He returns to Turkey in order to report on a wave of suicides of teenage girls who are forbidden to wear their headscarves. Sounds fascinating, right? But he doesn't necessarily you why, but he does admit being a journalist in Kars (hometown) wasn't his sole purpose; all that in the first chapter. I figured he was going on a self-knowledge quest; a journey for the happiness he felt as a child. I mean, isn't that why he's going back to Kars? Ka is very sentimental character, and he hopes to reconnect with his life-long love, Ipek, who is living solitary, whom he knew as adolescence.. This novel is especially disappointing because the book has so much potential, but it turned out to be a big peice of crap. Besides these story lines of love, religion and politics is the constant presence of the snow, which traps the city, its population, the story and the unfolding events. It is described in great detail, and these form some of the nicest passages in the book, evocative of the cold and the quiet that decends during heavy snowfall. Then snow also turns to be the backdrop for Ka's new inspiration for poems. He has not written anything for years while in exile and his time in Kars, his love for Ipek, the events unfolding around him and the snow, reinspire him to write. So Ka is walking his destiny's path, whoop-dee-doo.. I had troube finishing it, the way Pamuk had trouble addressing themes that he wished to include in the novel.","Sep 08, 2011"
1012011,jordan,"When Turkish writer Oham Pamuk won the prize in 2006, he had already produced several extraordinary works. Since winning, Pamuk has continued to produce a host of excellent works of both fiction and non-fiction. However, his 2004 novel ""Snow"" still stands out his best book to date.. The story follows the Turkish Poet Ka, newly returned from political exile. He journeys to the provincial city of Kars, which has is suffering an epidemic of suicides among teen girls who refuse to follow a decree that they must uncover their heads. In addition to his journalistic interest in this story, Ka is searching for Ipek, a woman he knew in college about whom he has been carrying a torch for decades. Isolated by a snow storm, Kars falls into a spate of political chaos. Caught in the middle, Ka must navigate the factional violence, even as he must decide what compromises he's willing to make to gain the woman he loves.. Pamuk writes this novel with a Nabokovian charm, knitting together a cast of endearing individualized characters and a fast moving plot. Layered within the story are serious thoughtful discussions about a host of topics: identity, god, religion, love, and poetry, all delivered with a subtle ear for prose. One must also tip a hat to this particularly handsome edition which is being put out by Everyman's Library. The volume also includes a thoughtful introductory essay from Margaret Atwood, herself a worthy Nobel candidate whom the sphinxes of Stockholm seem committed to overlooking and a post-script essay by Pamuk. Whether you are encountering this fine novel again or for the first time, the edition of ""Snow"" is a sure treat.","Dec 06, 2011"
10472582,Bookcase Jim,"FINALLY!. Reading Snow was like running a marathon. I'll leave the analogy alone right there, but suffice to say I felt immense relief after reading the last line. I also felt a deep sense of satisfaction. While I haven't read any of Pamuk's other novels, I can see why Snow got the accolades it did. In the microcosm of Kars, through the eyes of Ka, Pamuk presents 'The Great Turkish Novel'.. The novel is centered around a visit to Kars, a city in eastern Turkey. A string of suicides by local high-school girls is making headlines in Istanbul. Ka, a poet and political exile, decides to visit and form his own opinion. Of course, it also happens that a former University flame now lives in Kars.. But to retell the story is extremely banal. Speaking of, it's not the plot that moves the story at all; it's observations like this, ""The issue is the same for all real poets. If you've been happy too long you become banal. By the same token, if you've been unhappy for a long time, you lose your poetic powers....Happiness and poetry can only coexist for the briefest time. Afterward either happiness coarsens the poet or the poem is so true it destroys his happiness."". Pamuk talks of God, poems, of love, politics, and the socio-economic divide that layers Turkish society. He talks about the East and West, and about loneliness. About human things. And he does it very well. Many other authors don't - or can't - and that's why they simply write novels, not literature.. Read Snow because it's worth the sweat. Don't expect to be entertained, but expect to be satiated.","Jul 01, 2014"

A friend from Istanbul now lives there, and is recently divorced. And through a mysterious narrator (who is...the actual author inserting himself into his novel) and Ka's own perspective, we learn about the Islamists, the Nationalists, the Kurds, the communists, and leftists that are trying to coexist in this city.. Cut off from the rest of the country by a snowstorm, a theatrical coup occurs--and Ka has somehow found himself as a go-between. And for the first time in years, he is writing poems again. Really all he wants is to take Ipek back to Germany with him, so they can live happily ever after and he can publish his new book of poems.. I know there is a lot in this book that I missed. The poet's name (nickname) is Ka. The city is Kars. The title of the book in Turkish is Kar (snow). Obviously this all means something, but what, exactly, I don't know. Do ""Kar"", ""Kars"", and ""Ka"" sound alike in Turkish? The city of Kars has a very different history than most Turkish cities, as it had a Russian garrison in the past, and has a lot of Armenian architecture. Does the setting of a Turkish city with a different history than most Turkish cities to explain the various factions in modern Turkey mean anything? What?. So, then story itself is interesting, but I am certain I missed a fair amount due to lack of cultural and historical knowledge about Turkey.","Apr 28, 2020"
426277,James,"Orhan Pamuk' s novel is set in the winter of 1992 in the city of Kars in the north-eastern part of Turkey. The story is narrated by Pamuk himself as he tells of the poet journalist Kerim Alakusoglu, known as Ka is a poet, who returns to Turkey after 12 years of political exile in Germany. He has several motives, first, as a journalist, to investigate the events surrounding a group of young women who are committing suicide rather than give up their headscarves, but also in the hope of meeting a woman he used to know. Heavy snow cuts off the town for about three days during which time Ka is in conversation with a former communist, a secularist, a fascist nationalist, a possible Islamic extremist, Islamic moderates, young Kurds, the military, the Secret Service, the police and in particular, an actor-revolutionary. In the midst of this, love and passion are to be found. This is a very contemporary story of the clash between devout Islamists and the secular state that controls Turkey. Isolating the action in the snowbound town of Kars we learn of the tensions through Ka's interviews with various citizens. Pamuk's narrative style presents a pastiche of events that blend together to form the story with both love and politics coming to the fore. The many surprises and shocks of the story kept me interested and I found new fascination for the contemporary history of Turkey. The translation by Maureen Freely, who has translated several of Pamuk's novels, is excellent.","Jan 15, 2009"
3961732,Ron,"So many words have been written here already about this fine and fascinating book, I'm reluctant to add more, but it does that to you - makes you want to talk about it to anyone who will listen. At 448 pages, it attempts in recounting the events of three short days in a single backwater town to represent all it can of the political, ethnic and religious conflict in modern-day Turkey. And it does so from so many different perspectives that reading it becomes increasingly like getting lost in a hall of mirrors. Nothing is quite what it seems.. Part farce, part intrigue, part thriller, part love story, part melodrama, part detective story, part postmodern narrative (the author, for instance, writes himself into the story), ""Snow"" would find its cinematic counterpart in the film ""Casablanca."" Layered as it is with wonderful conceits and literary devices, it pretends at times to be no more than a work of fiction, while it clearly uses them to offer a bold portrayal of the state of a nation where the wearing of a headscarf is never just a fashion choice.. There is plenty of plot and a multitude of characters. And there are surprises enough along the way to keep a reader guessing to the end. While it may seem slow going and aimless at times, it rewards the patient reader with a series of closing chapters that brings together a range of themes and storylines in a satisfying and bittersweet way.

6289153,Alfa Hisham,"Well into 20 pages of the book, I realized that it was gonna be one bitter frosty read. The ceaseless snow fall in a remote ghost town of Kars continues from the beginning of the book till the last page, with occasional location change to Frankfurt, casting a deep depressing lull. Orhan introduces to the reader a Turkish society which is in conflict because of its secularists and Islamist ideologies. Ka, the protagonist, just like most of us is broken at several levels. And it is mostly through his eyes that we see Kars and its peculiar characters. Though the narration flatly gives away what is to happen next, it gave me enough anxiety and twinge making me sit long hours trying to decipher the emotional layers of this complicated situation. It makes you ponder over the articles of faith in Islam which overtime hardened, propelling as intolerance and finally making a grant entry as violence. The other side of this is the leftist or as the orthodox Islamist call ""atheist"" ideologies which when adopted used suppression and torture to counter act the intolerance. The end result of the opposing forces was nothing but chaos. The several legged story also churns the mental states like love, jealousy, anger and desperation draining your emotional quotient as you struggle to find a fine line of peace.. Orhan's description of snow is repetitive, but it serves as the primary ingredient for setting the mood of this fiction.","Jan 12, 2017"

""On the fourth day after his return to Turkey, Ka, a Turkish poet who has been an exile in Germany since twelve years, finds himself in the city of Kars for an interview. Walking under the slow and ceaseless snow, street by street, store by store, he tries to get to know this melancholic and beautiful city and its people. In Kars there are teahouses full of unemployed people, a snowbound traveling theatrical company, girls who protest and commit suicide for the headscarf banning, various political groups, gossips, rumors, Karpalas Hotel and its owner Turgut Bey, his daughters İpek and Kadife and a promise of love and happiness for Ka."". is a story of the impossibility of return, particularly of an emotional return. It is an exiles story and it is a story of the ultimate sacrifice of the exile, or emigrant. This is Ka's situation and, like many Turks, Yugoslavs and Greeks, the superficial cultural differences between origin and destination mask a real impossibility as cultural acclimatisation naturally chooses the destination. The impossibility is to hold to both cultures as they evolve. And this is an impossibility that presents itself emotionally - in the soul.","Aug 03, 2014"
9837446,Pip,"The start was very promising. I was excited by the description of Kars, which I thought conveyed the way the place looked, and more importantly felt. The snowfall cutting Kars off from the rest of the world set a menacing tone which promised much. The premise of a reporter asking various people for their viewpoints on the issue of headscarves and suicides was a good one. However, the endless and somewhat pointless discussions which Ka had with the religious schoolboys, the Sheik, the Islamic fundamentalist, the newspaper editor and Uncle Tom Cobbley and all became somewhat tiresome. Instead of feeling empathy with the headscarf wearing schoolgirls or the suicides, I became confused. The shocking assassination of the School Director right in front of him and the shootings in the theatre were subsumed to Ka's obsession with Ipek. His sudden prolific poetry writing was almost comic in the way that he stopped whatever he was doing to jot down a new poem. The last section of the book was much more interesting and rewarded the persistence of the reader. The difficult issues of secularism and fundamentalism were explained by characters who epitomised these viewpoints.

Or perhaps it’s Pamuk’s subject matter.. I adored the opening chapters; Pamuk’s masterful settings always draw me in. But I just can’t stay with it. Ka is spineless and self-absorbed; and I’m not at all sure why it’s time to demonize lefties and allow religious fundamentalists seemingly endless self-justifying speeches, which are both tedious and irritating (and perhaps more so to me because I’m about to go to a country at-risk of control by religious fundies—the topic is not mere intellectual exercise). (In fact, it occurred to me more than once as I waded through the various religious arguments that this book is Pamuk’s attempt to seem intellectually relevant—which is always a weak position from which to proceed.) I will return to this book, and Pamuk’s graceful style, in the future. But it is not the book for me right now. Right now, I simply wish that Pamuk’s painterly, rather then writerly, instincts were in charge of this project.","Jan 18, 2008"
1531518,Natalia,"I don't even know what to say about this book. It is deeply existential. Everyone is unhappy, and it's snowing. Everyone is experiencing their own personal unhappiness. In the snow.. I'm kind-of shortchanging it a little, because there is a lot of fascinating political context, but somehow that gets overshadowed by the fact that the book is a long exploration of how everybody lies to others and themselves about their motivations. The contrast of the public moral certainty of the religious high school boys and headscarf girls immediately gets contrasted with the moral unacceptability of suicide... then somewhere along the way we forget all about the suicides and instead wander off to see that Blue has been carrying on affairs with both of the sisters, and Ka is attracted to both of them... and I don't know. It wanders off into a bramble patch of ubiquitous hypocrisy for most of the 2nd half of the book.. The whole book ended up to mm to have abandoned all of the interesting things about contemporary Turkish political culture, to get lost in the idea that everybody lies, to others and themselves, and that especially they lie to themselves about love.","Jun 30, 2009"
107445,Chelsea,"I feel sheepish about my low 1 star rating because EVERYONE I know who read this book LOVED it. Loved it as in it was one of their all time favorite books. I am left to assume that the problem lies, not with the book, but with me. I wonder if the disconnect lies in my relatively low familiarity with Islamic culture? Perhaps my ignorance of Turkish history and culture? Or maybe its just a subjective reaction based on what moves me personally. Perhaps it was just that I didn't like Ka and no other character had enough of a presence or draw to hook me (except the religious school boys who I found the most interesting characters and plotline in the whole book). Maybe its just one of the subjective reactions that is based on personal taste. After all, I dislike Hemingway and I can't exactly say the blame lies with him. Right? All that said, maybe those of you who love this book could help me to understand why... education and discussion changes perception.. This could be like when I stood in front of the Rothko with my mom and explained to her why I felt like weeping while she wondered why it was art? She came around... and maybe you can help me to do the same?","Jan 14, 2011"
4135485,Molly,"It's difficult to articulate how I feel about this book. I can't say that I really. enjoyed. reading it, but I am glad that I did. I appreciate a work of fiction that can make broad-ranging statements about humanity without heavy-handedness, and this is an excellent example. The characters in the novel are almost tangential, plot devices to further the agenda of the true characters - the political, religious, and intellectual factions at odds in this morality play, of sorts.. That said, I did find the novel overly ""talky"" in many places. I suppose that's the nature of the beast when the author must set up the viewpoint of each of his characters, especially when they come with a great deal of charged political and religious baggage. But on occasion, I did find myself thinking, ""Just get on with it, already!"" as two characters argued for page after page about the meaning of, say, pride and its role in suicide. It's heavy lifting, and after a while, the load is too much to want to bear anymore.. But in the end, the novel gave me a great deal to think about, and I think I am more intellectually and culturally aware of some aspects of humanity than I was before I read it.","Aug 04, 2012"
620387,Joanna,"I would never have made it through this book in print. It's too plodding; too layered; too long. The structure of the book distances the reader from the action. But John Lee nailed it in the audio version. The book translates surprisingly well to audio format because the story is relayed by a narrator. A sometimes whiny, sometimes arrogant, sometimes insecure narrator. Telling the story of a poet who is much like himself, with whom the narrator has developed some fascination and desire to uncover the ""real story"" of the poet.. Pamuk is able to evoke a sense of place here that carries through the novel. Kars is a remote town made more remote by a snowstorm that cuts them off from the world and stops the trains from running.. Overall, I really enjoyed the book and some of the memorable characters here will stick with me. This is only my second Pamuk (the first was. The White Castle. ), but it won't be my last. I'll just need to save his books for times when I can concentrate on the text or look for other audio versions.","Sep 13, 2016"
2828,Erin,"I was excited about this one. I read Pamuk's The Black Book in college, and it rocked. And Snow was a NYT Book of the Year! Can't go wrong.. Ugh, except you can. This one is a stinker. For me, I mean. I don't want to say that Orhan Pamuk ever wrote anything bad, so I'll just say I didn't connect with this particular work. Half the time I had no idea what the characters were talking about, and part of me thinks its because I'm not smart enough. Here is one piece of dialogue that made me want to tear out my hair:. ""I have written this poem, do you think it is beautiful?"". ""It is. I do think it is beautiful. It is a beautiful poem."". ""Are you sure? Are you certain it is beautiful?"". ""I am certain. I know that it is a beautiful poem."". ""What about it is beautiful?"". ""I don't know, but I know that is is beautiful."". ""But how do you know? Are you sure it is beautiful?"". ""I am sure. It is beautiful."". ""It is beautiful. You are right. The poem, it is beautiful."". AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHHH!","May 24, 2007"
638250,Kate.,"The most appropriately-named novel ever written? I think so. Snow reads slowly, gently, like a solitary stroll through a quiet winter storm. It is the story of Ka, a poet who returns home after years of estrangement to report on a suicide epidemic among Muslim girls, and gets dragged to the center of religious (really political) revolution. Overwhelmed with his desires and doubt, Ka wonders: ""What am I doing in this world? A man lives his life, and then he falls apart and soon there is nothing left."" Just like snowflakes, human lives in this novel fall, fall apart, are gone.. Ka's story teaches us a valuable travel tip: Don't have an existential crisis in Turkey. Decide whether you're an atheist before you leave home, because a religious revolution is not the time or place to reconsider your belief/disbelief in God.. This is a brilliant and relevant book. Get in on Orham Pamuk now, because he's headed straight for the canon. And if you should pick Snow up, don't fight its slow pace, just embrace it and keep moving -- like you would in any snow storm.","Oct 20, 2009"
2290389,Carol,"Long, long narrative on the scarring conflict in modern Turkey between the secular and religious muslims and how each side is trapped in its own fanaticism until every believing individual in the novel is destroyed by his/her own blinding beliefs.. While Pamuk addresses one of the most damaging conflicts in the modern (or post-modern) world, the length of the narrative became overwhelming by the intractability of the situation and the characters. The reader knows early on that nothing but pain and destruction will envelop all the characters, one more useless killing after the next, with almost no one escaping and no resolution---which I expect is the point of the book. Only the written word is salvageable, poetry especially.. While there is a tediousness to the book, it is beautifully written; I have only touched on the bare bones of the novel which is open to endless discussion of the setting, the concept of snow, the characters, religion, secularism, where Pamuk, the author,stands in this narrative, etc. etc.","Oct 24, 2009"
14172,Becky,"First off: don't take my 2-star rating to mean that this book is poorly written or otherwise lacking in literary merit. It's just that I didn't enjoy it all that much. I picked it up because Pamuk won the Nobel Prize for Literature a few years ago, and I can see why. This novel clearly aims to capture the conflicted and complex Turkish national identity, torn between fundamentalist Islam and modern Westernization, and it probably succeeds. But I felt it was somewhat lacking as a. novel. . I just felt like a lot of the characters' motivations are never clearly explained, or even hinted at enough to allow the reader's comprehension. I don't know, maybe something was lost in translation? And for a book whose main character is a poet constantly writing things, I found it kind of odd that none of his poems are actually included. I guess I'm glad I read it because it gave me some insight into a culture I don't know much about, and it does feel very relevant to current world conflicts and events. But I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to recommend it to others.","Feb 21, 2011"
1947209,Ryna,"This is more a 4.5 star review but since I can't give half stars I'm upgrading to 5. I did, after all, thoroughly enjoy this modern classic.. I started this book on vacation but since I don't actually end up reading a whole lot while off frolicking somewhere I only finished this a few days ago.. It's my first Orhan Pamuk novel but if his other books are anything like this one I would love to read more of him. The language he employs is elegant and beautiful and suitably evoked a very melancholy feeling in me as I read through this story. He seamlessly tackles heavy topics such as religion, politics, the friction between the east and the west and so forth while allowing us to be enamored by his fictional world. I believe this is why even though I didn't particularly care for Ka and in the end, disliked him a lot, I still really enjoyed the book. Plus there's some of the best quotes about love in this book!. After reading a series of novels that were 'easy read best seller types' this was quite refreshing.","Dec 17, 2011"
5200197,windy,"I really tried to take this seriously, but as the infantile main character kept blundering through tragic situations rhapsodising about the beauty of snow, he started to resemble a Turkish counterpart to Forrest Gump more than a brilliant poet. The feeling grew with his deep insights like ""Every life is like a snowflake..."" One of the supposedly brilliant poems (which we don't get to see) is called ""The Chocolate Box"". Hmm.... The hapless main character would have been tolerable if the book had offered some insight into the clash between islamists and secularists, but that treatment seemed shallow as well. The impression I got from this book is that both sides are motivated by a deep-seated inferiority complex towards the West - I would prefer to give the people a bit more credit than that. The islamists are charismatic Robin Hood types, from reading this book you wouldn't know why anyone could possibly have a problem with them. And the ""evil mastermind"" when finally revealed was simply ridiculous.","May 01, 2012"
442654,Andrew,"While Pamuk himself might consider this an offense, he is a remarkably European writer. Ultimately, this is a story of the problem of the individual in a society that he has become alienated from. The difference is that (unlike the existentialist crew) he is doubly alienated; first, he is alienated from the traditional Muslim culture he was raised with, and second, he is alienated from the West in which he has found exile.. I'm rather perplexed when reviewers call Pamuk a ""postmodernist."" I don't think that word means what they think it means. I think they think it means ""difficult."" OK, Pamuk is difficult. But I really hate it when people conflate those two ideas... harumph.. But beyond being, simply, an existentialist novel, Pamuk also weaves in poetic beauty, moments of humor, and incisive commentary on the notions of ""East"" and ""West,"" and ultimately how silly and self-defeating those notions are. I read The Black Book back in college and remember loving it for so many of the same reasons.","Jul 28, 2012"
11547335,Rachel,"Still not sure what to think of this. It took me a long time (like half the book) to get into it, and even then I found it difficult. It's not a Western novel; the characters are all tropes and are there primarily as vehicles for Pamuk's complicated, multifaceted discussions about a variety of hard philosophical discussions. Individualism isn't a big part of their reason for existence. In addition, Pamuk is way more about the telling than the showing, which is hard for someone who's spent so much time in creative writing classes that tell you to do just the opposite. Especially at the beginning, there are logical leaps that I didn't understand; two sentences would be paired in the middle of a paragraph and I didn't understand why. And the book is BLEAK.. Was torn between giving this 2 and 3 stars, but in the end when I finally started to understand what Pamuk was trying to do in writing it, I think it affected me way more. Best tip: read the Wikipedia article and a couple of decent reviews to get a feel for it.","Aug 03, 2012"
1486994,Jen Greene,"This book placed me in a world completely unknown to me. I fell in love with the characters, and wanted to know where they were going, what they were thinking, and more importantly, what they were up to. I wanted to understand truly what wearing a head scarf and what removing a head scarf meant, and how it affected everyone. I wanted the snow to save a city. I wanted poetry to bring peace.. A dramatic review, but this is a dramatic read. One that the reader will need some time to digest, and not simply 20 minutes on a commute. This novel would be best read cozied up by a roaring fire, the only light in the room, with a glass of wine or whiskey during a snowstorm where you know you won't be leaving your home for a day or two.. A glimpse to one of my favorite quotes: ""Not a day passes when the eagle of dark depression doesn't take flight in my soul,"" said Sunay, infusing his words with mysterious pride. ""But I cannot catch myself. So hold yourself in. All's well that ends well."". It's a beautiful story... tortured, and happy, and dramatic, and tearful... and all at once.","Jul 16, 2013"
16849001,Teàrlach,"I hated this book. I hated it so much, I almost didn't finish it. Here's some reasons, because I can't be bothered being too coherent about this:. 1. Its protagonist (and its narrator, too) were insufferable.. 2. Everyone the protagonist approached or was approached by was inclined to tell him their life story. If it wasn't their life story, then it was a long-winded story about an event that they may or may not have participated in, that is somehow either a parallel to whatever is happening in the novel, or foreshadowing.. 3. So much foreshadowing.. 4. So many life stories.. 5. Too many characters who came across as unrealistic.. 6. Halfway through the novel, I lost interest in what the novel was trying to achieve. I'm still not sure, despite the blurbs extolling its virtues and singing its praises. Was it about religious conflict? Was it about sacrifice? Was it about art and the meaning of life? Was it about a poet who happens to be an asshole?. 7. Ka's poetry was shit.. 8. So much casual sexism. So much weird prose about women.. I could go on. Really, I could.","Dec 13, 2015"
258722,Pige,"I have to admit, I'm putting this book on my shelf even though I could only tolerate reading about 1/2 of it. So this is more of a warning review. Although I know the book received soaring reviews from people much more leaned and qualified than myself, I really became frustrated with it despite my curiosity to see how it ended I stopped. From the beginning I found the main character a bit annoying. But, I continued on as I've found other heroes and heroines annoying and still enjoyed the book. I also found the relationships created by the author to be unconvincing. They felt shallow and lacked detail, yet the actions and words within the relationship would at times imply deep intimacy that must have developed when I wasn't looking. More positively, I will give praise to the narrations and illustrations describing the religious feelings of some of the characters as well as the descriptions of the physical surroundings.","Aug 21, 2007"
78503,Chris,"The first thing I thought when I was reading this is that I don't know enough about Turkey. The second thing was that I had no idea what was supposed to be interesting about the plot. It was well written though, and so I pushed onward until the character's personal drives and motives started to be caught up in the country's political entanglements. Then it got really interesting.. The fact that the main character is a poet who can't write when outside of a certain space was thought provoking. There were about ten years where I didn't write poetry, and I think that maybe certain places can just strangle that out of you.. The novel's idea that people don't take the poor in novels seriously is well stated, but also, it's been heard before. All of the characters here seem worried about the outside world thinking their troubles are pathetic and cute. I suppose that would make you defensive.","Sep 11, 2007"
354781,Miles,"Pamuk won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006, so clearly he's no lightweight. What has become equally clear to me, however, is that international prize-winning authors are not necessarily my cup of tea.. I picked up ""Snow"" because I found Pamuk's earlier book ""The White Castle"" enjoyable - at least, in a sort of uncomfortable, squeamish, Franz Kafka kind of way. ""Snow"" covered a very different era and character set but was similar in many ways. Both depicted a world where reality and perception are, sometimes bizarrely, confused. But ""Snow"" is long, very long. It started feeling tedious when, half way through, I was so frustrated with the characters that I wanted to reach in and shake them. I had the same reaction to the Egyptian author Naguib Mahfouz; he also won a Nobel Prize for his work, and I also wanted to shake sense into the characters. Does this say more about these authors or about me?","Jan 27, 2010"
3673799,Whitney,"This novel was slow-going at first. I have to admit to learning a lot about Turkish culture, encountering a few aspects that were unexpected. While this novel was often repetitive and seemed to drag, I had an interesting experience in relating to the bleeding-heart poet and his attempts at integrity. While he made some serious mistakes, he still somehow managed to stay true to himself. The personal commitment to a life lacking any real light is tragic and self-destructive, yet he somehow makes it seem the correct path.. I admired the way the author could describe situations, facial expressions, the hidden messages that the eyes carry. I'll admit that I am a bit jealous of how eloquently he describes the nuances of a given interaction. I wish this allowed for half-stars, I would give one just for writing style, and for introducing me to aspects of a culture with which I am unfamiliar.","Jan 02, 2011"

Felt the jadedness of those in the cities... it's different with those in the villages... there's still much joy to be sensed in their lives, their surprise and excitement at meeting other ""Musulmans"" from other parts of the world.... Turks are so isolated, they forget that there are other Muslims around the world.... Even the people of Kars in the novel addressed the possible readers of the novel as ""Western""... probably, didn't even think that Muslims from other parts of the world will also be reading the novel.... Well, I read it and I'm a Muslim from the Malay Archipelago and I feel you, Turkey.. I FEEL you.... Wallahu'alam....

3428865,Lise Petrauskas,"Thoughts so far:. Interesting, but I'm not super invested in the characters. The story structure really bring The Castle to mind. There is a central character in town who visits everybody and gets a version of their personal manifesto, and there's a sense that an unknown organization or power structure is pulling the strings. Characters are speaking about big issues, politics and religion, but it tends to feel too academic. The occasional intrusion of a first person narrator trying yo reconstruct events years later is interesting as are some ominous references to what will be happening in the future. The contemporary writer I'm reminded of is Jose Saramago. There too, there's somewhat of a thought experiment going on and I'm more or less engaged depending on who is speaking at any given time.. I am enjoying learning about the history and culture of a part of the world I know very little about.","May 24, 2013"
7135649,Millicent,"One either really loves Orhan Pamuk, or hates his work. I am of the latter group, I don't understand why he received the nobel prize for literature. This book was promising at first, a Turkish political and literary exile returns from Germany to look for a crush he had in his youth, under the cover of researching a spate of women committing suicide. He is a celebrity in the forlorn city of Kars, and becomes meshed in the city's struggle between Islamists and Ataturk secularists. There is a massacre by the army, in a theatre during a play headed by a former popular actor, who is also behind the massacre. It all sounds lovely, but really every character in the book has the EQ of a child. They are easily excited and apt to act on impulse. The books ending was such an anti-climax, I didn't feel closure at all. Just anger at having wasted my time reading this piece of garbage.. Seriously Nobel committee, get your shit together.","Jan 22, 2014"
81354,Shaheen Ashraf-Ahmed,"This book began tortuously slowly... I thought if I read the word 'snow' one more time I would fling it across the room (perhaps Turkish has 50 words for snow, so it doesn't sound so tedious in the original). I also didn't get the fact that middle-aged men kept crying over nothing (a Turkish/cultural thing? I don't know). Also, just like ""high-class"" literature, some of the characters are poetic ideas of what people are - real people could not function like that and would not speak like that.. However, the pace of the book got a little better, and I was interested in how the issue of hijab was demonstrated as being something that was being manipulated for political reasons, both by the pseudo-religious set and the rabid anti-hijab nationalist set. It was quite literally being used for political theatre by both extremes.. All in all, not really worth the effort.","Aug 02, 2007"
390242,Mark,"I tried, I really tried, but this book is so boring. The writing is unexceptional, the story is uninteresting. I am going to be charitable and say that the book is probably much better in Turkish, the original language. I had great hopes for the book because 1) the author won the Nobel Prize and 2) the plot has a lot of theoretical promise. The story is ostensibly about an expatriate poet returning home to investigate the story of girls who have been committing suicide rather than obeying a government ban on the head scarves that they wear for religious reasons. It turns out that this story is only the jumping off point for an incredibly dull love story and the minutiae of Turkish politics. The titular snow is also used as metaphor, symbol, pun ad nauseam throughout the book, with all the subtlety of a shovel to the face.","Feb 13, 2009"
1383849,Patrick,"This book was a great book with multiple levels. On the socio-political level this book is about the internal struggles in Turkey of how to be both modern and adhere to Islam. The military is needed to crush the threat of Islamic fundamentalism. This brings up an excellent question to whether a true democracy can exist in a devoutely Islamic state? I guess Turkey is the best example of this phenomenon and the hope for Iraq is it transform itself to this model. But even in Turkey, the military is still needed to check Islamic Fundamentalism and its war on the west.. On the more personal level it is about a poet who gives up his political ideals to find true happiness in the image of ""true love."". On a more intrapersonal matter, it is about the internal pull of belief in God and atheism.","Jun 25, 2009"
1729898,Elizabeth,"I'm not quite sure where to begin with this novel. I felt Pamuk held me at a distance from the heart of his story, though much of this book is so intimate, sometimes painfully so. Like the central mystery of My Name Is Red, the quest to uncover the main character's book of poems becomes a frustrating conceit. However, the characters were so vulnerable that I almost felt guilty putting the book down - they're wonderfully raw and mortal.. When I started this book, I worried it would be too political to be interesting to me, but in all, the human element is much stronger. Still, the book addressed new (to me) questions about what my ""Western"" sensibilities mean, but these issues seemed to almost get buried in extremely detailed accounts of blocking and setting.. I would recommend this book to people who are more patient than me.","Dec 20, 2010"

I do feel relieved I've finally finished it - it took me almost four months to finish it, sometimes I wished I had the strength to throw it away... Still... You cannot throw Pamuk away. His never ending descriptions of the snow covered Kars, Ka's unhappiness, Ipek's beauty, over and over again... I admit I'm not interested in politics, or religion, and I read SNOW as a sad love story, or a very repetitive and sometime boring description of snow, but I liked it altogether.

2214037,Kris,"This book is waaaaay overwritten. It reminds me of the crappy overwritten stuff I had to read in high school, assigned by overzealous English teachers.. There's an old Frasier episode, first or second season, where Frasier realizes that the newest most popular book around was stolen by an old bar friend from Frasier's own past. He sits down to read the book and gets towards the end and reads something along the lines of ""and he was going to leave. He was going to leave like fall leaves way to winter, like the sea leaves the sand..."". So he reads ahead a little bit, turns the page, skims, turns another page, another page, and then nods. ""And so he left."". That's what it made me think of. Life is too short to read poorly written books.

A political thriller in fact, something which the world was waiting for so long after Dostoyevsky. I must call it as a passionate expression of grief from his heart watching the never ending conflict between secularism and extremist islamic sentiments. The book starts of with some brilliant quotes just before the journey begins, of which this one in particular, needs a certain care and deep understanding, said by Dostoyevsky ""Well, then eliminate people, curtail them, force them to be silent.Because the European enlightenment is more important than people.""","May 07, 2014"

As the main character is going through a combination of mid-life crises, emotional awakening, creative brainstorms, confusing situations, and, eventually, dealing with threats on his life, the whole book is a convulated experience.. It was especially interesting for me to experience the conflict between the European point of view and Muslim Turkish point of view, both in the obvious, with the theme of ""the head scarf girls"" and in the interpretation of reality that kept being pointed out.

2092969,Miriam,"I liked his memoir on Istanbul, so I thought I'd try his fiction. He won a Nobel prize and everything.. I found this book a little slow. Based on the summary, I expected more action. It's very introspective for a military coup book. And there's really very little attempt to deal with the ""mystery"" of the head-scarf girls committing suicide (a variation on ""why do women do anything?"").. I did like a couple of passages: ""every person has a star, every star has a friend, and for every person carrying a star there is someone else who reflects it, and everyone carries this reflection like a secret confidante in the heart."" (118). ""The important thing was to share the hopelessness, to create a little nest in which two people could live together, keeping the rest of the world at bay."" (303). As for story and characters: meh. The main character, Ka, is the most well-developed, and even he's not a complete character, more a collection of contradictions. He's sad when he's happy because he'll lose his happiness eventually. He wants to marry a woman he barely knows because she's beautiful. He has some political convictions (enough to get him sent into exile), but mostly he just wants to be left alone enough to write poetry. The rest of the characters are just sketches--it's impossible to predict what they might do because they are just conglomerations of...nothing, really. They talk but say contradictory things. They behave in inexplicable ways. Given the themes of contrast with the West, I thought maybe I just didn't get it because of some cultural meanings I'm not familiar with. But I don't think that's it. Even if the West glorifies the individual and the idea of a traditional novel or literature, Pamuk buys into that enough to insert himself into the story at the end and try to tie up everything neatly with closure. So I think they're just unformed, which makes it hard to care about them, because they don't seem to stand for anything or mean any consistent thing.. Most of this reads like absurdity. The absurdity of a theater troupe staging a coup. The absurdity of a grown man interrupting his reading of his poem repeatedly to ask if it's good and beautiful. And Ka's references to previous coups in his childhood make the whole thing seem very silly and out of touch with reality (although Ka is also very out of touch with reality--I don't think we're meant to identify with him, given that he doesn't really succeed in the end and the only thing he produced, that new book of poems, was something he didn't feel like he actually created himself but just took down for some external force and it's lost in the end anyway).. The political situation is also absurd: having to stand up for democracy in the face of an attempt to forestall an election in which a reactionary Islamist party is likely to win. The idea of putting ON the veil as the correct thing to do, if the secular government tries to stop you. Defying the order to conformity is good, trying to protect democracy as is dissolves is good. And there are a variety of forces at work: the military, the militant rebels, the intelligence forces, the government, the student movements. It's complex, but not often clearly rendered: Ka's unwillingness to look closely plus the narrator's desire to follow that whim leaves us with very little clarity. You should stand up for your principles, even if they will implode. And then there's some stuff about love, but I won't bother, because I don't believe that love is the same as lust, and if all two people do is make love and like each other's looks, I don't buy that that's love OR the key to happiness. And again, I don't think Ka's ideas about love/happiness being the most important thing are to be taken seriously, because he can't sustain those feelings very long at all. His emotional reactions to almost every event mystified me. I can accept that people have various complex feelings about things, but his seem so odd and inexplicable. At least in Knut Hamsen's Hunger the emotional swings seemed to have meaning or reason, as much as they could in the hands of such an unstable narrator.. And as for the narrator: it's dumb to make himself the narrator at the end. The early omniscience is only poorly explained by the series of careful notes Ka left and the painstaking interviews the narrator performs to say ""dear reader, this is how I can know such improbable things."" Not good enough. There's not enough of a reason for him to be in it not to go with a simpler narrative structure.. I've got one other Pamuk novel to read. Hope it's better than this one.","May 11, 2019"
48186542,Pankhuri,"I am still unsure how I feel about this book, with so many elements constantly in play. With a deeply-flawed, conceited, difficult-to-love, selfish, possessive, jealous protagonist against the backdrop of a cruel and alienating city, misogyny, religious extremism, atheism, love and God, I truly wonder how Pamuk was able to bring this intensely enjoyable book to a halt.. I share a few quotes from the book that I am going to carry with me for as long my memory would permit.. ""... these women who shouted and wailed at their children all day long were the ones who kept life going. If they ceased to exist, it would be the end of the line for the millions of joyless, jobless, aimless men all over Anatolia. ... without women looking after them, they would end up like beggars who froze to death on street corners during cold snaps, or the drunks who staggered out of taverns to fall into open sewers, or the senile grandfathers sent off to the grocery stores in their pyjamas and slippers to buy a loaf of bread only to lose their way. Yet these men were all too numerous.. Although they owed their lives to their women, the love they felt for their wives made them so ashamed that they tortured them. "". p.198. ""Because mankind's greatest error... the biggest deception of the past thousand years is this: to confuse poverty with stupidity"". p.282. ""People might feel sorry for a man who's fallen on hard times, but when an entire nation is poor, the rest of the world assumes at once that all the people of that nation must be brainless, lazy, dirty, clumsy fools. ...it's all a joke - their culture, their customs, their practices. As time goes by, some of the rest of the world begins to feel ashamed for having thought this way, and when they look around and see immigrants from that poor country mopping their floors and doing all the other lowest-paying jobs, naturally they worry about what might happen if these workers one day rose up against them. So, to keep things sweet, they start taking an interest in the immigrants' culture and sometimes even pretend to think of themselves as equals"". p.283. Despite the protagonist, Ka visiting Kars on the premise of the suicide epidemic among the women, there is a complete lack of perspective from the women save for two strong characters (Ipek, Ka's beautiful love-interest and her sister, Kadife, the rebellious and stubborn 'headscarf girl', seemingly placed to pique Ka's sexual interest). Ka has been depicted as a saviour of these women, as the only one who seeks the cause of their suicide, and is awestruck at the mundane nature of the act itself.. Completely unpalatable sex scenes which have been rebranded as 'love-making' were written in the manner of a man seeking to let out his outward frustrations through this masturbatory act where a woman is just lying there, waiting for it to be over, almost unsure of whether she is a part of the act or just a viewer in this perfunctory display of 'love'.. However, if the reader is able to look past these flaws, and the scattered, busy and tedious writing, this book is an essential reading on identity loss, religion and the tumultuous politics of Turkey.","Apr 02, 2020"
6079197,krishnendu mukherjee,"Though it feels like a dream as ""Snow"" unfolds in the streets of Kars, Erzurum, and Istanbul; its vividness, writing style, sympathy with its characters, and the nostalgia it brings makes it more real than most fictions I have read.. I choose this book because I liked how it began. Before this, I had gone through its early chapter and just like Pamuk's ""My Name is Red"", its beginning is brilliant, albeit distinct. The novel starts with our protagonist ""Ka"" as he embarks on a journey to the remote town of Kars at Turkey's border. His goal is to investigate a series of suicide. He is a journalist but also has many artistic ambitions, and again, he has a very sharp resemblance to ""Black"" - who also was an investigator in ""My Name is Red"". While Ka had been mostly unsuccessful in his life, he had some luck in getting recognition for his poems. He also wishes to do some poetry in Kars, and importantly, his eyes are on a special women named Ipek - who had just got divorced and currently living in Kars with her father and sister.. So, with many ambitions and unfulfilled desires of Ka, the Novel begins and we meet many players in the game. The main conflict is between Secularists (Government, the Military and Ataturk loyalists) and fundamental Islamists, who are playing a dangerous game of chess in these poor and forgotten cities. However, as we go deep in the novel, we find many more layers beyond this surface conflict and the narration really speeds up. Underneath everything, the conflict which I liked the most was the battle of identity or rather the loss of it. But there are many more, and I am sure, if you pay attention you will find a more interesting angle to look at things.. Overall it was a wonderful ride for me; especially the 2nd half which is ingenious. Also, I often find it hard when people criticize Pamuk for using weak characters or as many say ""weak men"". The problem doesn't lie with critics assuming that these men of Pamuk's don't exist in reality; they are in fact correct to say this. For example, the protagonist of Snow, the bovine poet 'Ka' is likely a man in a million, but that is exactly the point. The goal is not always to portray real-life people (although that has been the trend in Hollywood and many forms of fiction, which is fine and has its separate place), but to give us a sense of reality of Turkish people or take us inside the minds of the undereducated and deprived who live in an old place like Kars, this works splendidly. Torn between East and West, Religion and its virtues verus the secular enlightenment inspired by Europe, The moral high grounds of Quran versus the science and rational thinking of 21st century; these people are a sitting duck for zealots and fanatics. And to explore that; these weak characters are the best portals to choose. And that is why I loved the main protagonist. The conflicts or I say the multi-faceted rivalry is fleshed out brilliantly.. I will highly recommend this; especially if you are fond of good writing.. Krish","Oct 28, 2019"
5571752,Hafizz Nasri,"Snow tells a story of Turkish political, social and cultural in the 90s. The views of the whole plot-- just like how Pamuk written any of his novels-- was very detailed and descriptive, vivid explaination that somehow can be draggy but it sparks gripping narratives to the whole storytelling. I love Ka's character-- his string of random incidents during his visit to Kars involving in catastrophe of islamist vs atheist, secularist and orientalist stuff which giving me a depth view about the modern Turkish liberal ideas, acceptance and judgement also their freedom of thoughts. It was engaging and 'heavy' (as some suicide scenes took place), mysterious and despair.. I'm not really fond with the love story part, but somehow Ka's obsession in finding and examining his own happiness was beautifully narrated and quite intriguing-- his poetry journey and all the lovable feeling and admiration. It was interesting to see how the author trying to make use of all the characters as important as the main character, so I get to know everyone and about everything. Strange as how they were all having different background of perspectives-- an islamic extremist, fascist, revolutionary, secularist, nationalist.. Snow was poetically captivating. A restless lengthy journey of reading it, but I think it was blizzardly beautiful and thought-provoking.","Mar 06, 2020"
4703542,Mihai,"Wow, totally overrated. I can't think of any other way to describe my opinion of. Snow. , which was my much anticipated introduction to Orhan Pamuk and his Nobel Prize caliber literature. Just 150 pages into the book I was already bored with the story and the characters, and the only reason why I powered through to the end is because I don't like to leave things unfinished. Now that I reached an end that was neither surprising nor well-constructed, I am wondering if I really do want to check out Pamuk's other works. Perhaps more worrisome, over the last couple of years I've read highly rated authors such as Nabokov, Garcia Marquez, Faulkner, Pynchon or Salter, and they all failed to impress me in one way or another with works that just too esoteric, pretentious or confusing to have any appeal beyond small circles of people in the belles-lettres field. Unfortunately it appears that Pamuk will be joining this list, at least as far as this book is concerned.. I can understand how much can be lost in translation from one language to another, but for the most part I found Maureen Freely's effort here to be good, especially with the passages contrasting the decrepit city of Kars with the beautiful, pure snow falling on it that itself becomes one of the characters in the story. However, the quality of the prose is about the only thing that convinced me to give. Snow. two stars instead of one.. I really tried to make sense of what was going on, eventually giving up. Here are some impressions: A depressed Turkish poet living in exile in Germany returns to his native city (Kars), hoping to both find inspiration for his work and fall in love with a woman that he can then marry and return to Frankfurt with to live happily ever after. In three hallucinating days during which Kars is snowed in and cut off from the rest of the world, the protagonist Ka seduces and beds the ex-wife of a childhood friend and fellow poet, who now has political aspirations at the local level. Furthermore, Ka experiences intense bouts of creative inspiration not unlike trances, which result in a bounty of new poems that he plans to release as a collection after going back to Germany.. So far this is a plausible setting, however things get complicated quickly when Ka's presence in Kars becomes inextricably linked with bizarre acts of quarreling and retribution driven by regional politics, none of which are more strange than the coup staged by a theater troupe in collaboration with the secret intelligence service. That Turkey is a cauldron in which many cultures and denominations struggle to assert identities is something that Pamuk makes clear and that many readers probably already know, but in. Snow. this is taken to such an extreme that it becomes a completing confusing mishmash. In addition to the perpetual conflict between those that want to keep religion out of the affairs of the state and those who argue that because Turkey is an Islamic state, religion. defines. national identity, there are provincial interests involving Kurdish, Azeri, Armenian, Russian and a spectrum of other cultures. And, because no country exists in a vacuum, the perception of these struggles at an international level is very important to all parties involved, as countries like Germany in which Turks end up can affect the progress of Turkey itself.. All sorts of Kafka-esque things begin happening in Kars after snow closes all the roads out. Though he is an outsider, Ka is instinctively trusted with the most confidential information by everyone in a position of power, from sheiks to journalists to the local police and military forces, and even by the lead religious agitator, the befuddling Blue, who also turns out to be his romantic rival. While happiness strikes Ka in the form of new poems alternating with banging the hotel keeper's older daughter and dreaming of their carefree life in Germany, a performance artist with a secular agenda takes control of the city by means of staging theatrical plays which result in the capture and dismemberment of local religious factions. The local military in tandem with the secret intelligence are also on his side, though it is not clear how or why this alliance developed. Residents of Kars see it all unfolding before their very eyes, both inside the theater and on local TV, but no one seems to care much as ""revolutions"" are somewhat of a norm here. In general, people fight or argue, then put differences aside to watch soap operas on TV. Heated political arguments degenerate into jokes and nothing is seemingly taken seriously. When people do die, their disappearance is discussed at a philosophical level. The local journalist breaks bread with Ka at the dinner table, then calls him an agitator and a western spy in his paper, yet neither man is very troubled by such outrageous turns of events.. There are many important points Pamuk makes with. Snow. , from the absurd extremism of supporters of a religion-free state when hunting down and murdering Islamic militants, to the role of women in Turkish society, to the creative process which is so important to iconic artists. But to take away these important points, the reader has to deal with pathetic characters such as Ka, who seems to have little conviction beyond writing poems and making love to Ipek (how would Ka support their family, is something one would wonder). At the end, his jealousy destroys all prospects of that much sought happiness, leaving the author to try and pick up the pieces. Incredibly, Pamuk inserts himself as a character in the book and is not ashamed of admitting he lusts after the same woman as his 'friend' Ka - a woman with her own secrets and inability to break free of her past. Meanwhile, the so-called coups with which Ka was involved during his visit to Kars have no relevance whatsoever in the long-term political situation, serving only to provide the tumultuous background against which Ka can consume his passion while also laying down a poetic masterpiece, the content of which is never revealed other than an ingenious six-side conceptual structure in the form of a snow crystal.. I wish there was more to admire about. Snow. , which leaves the reader with asking themselves: ""what did I just read?""","Mar 28, 2012"
10577332,Matt Luedke,"The cover of this book instantly appealed to me, despite years of hearing warnings not to judge books based on such a thing. A blurred photo of someone walking alone in what looks like a city because of the tall buildings, particularly a section of it with very little traffic except for two other walkers in the distance. We can't tell who it is or anything about the person, or even which way they're facing, but we can tell that there's snow covering the ground. And with the blur effect on the photo, the white of the snow looks completely uniform. It might actually be uniform, or the blur might be hiding something.. As I read this book, I realized that, to me, it's main theme was that of identity. Just as we're unable to see anything about the person on the cover, or see any texture in the snow, it can be very hard to draw firm, focused lines between or around any of the characters. Two young men in the book claim to have a sort of psychic link between them, and eventually fall in love with the same woman. Orhan (who we meet in a presumably fictionalized version of himself) tasks himself with investigating the life of Ka, the main character, and their two identities begin to blur together too.. The blurring of identity is not only one among characters, but also between characters and their settings. The original book title in Turkish is ""Kar,"" translating of course to ""Snow."" The main character's name is Ka (not his true name, but the nickname he is known as in his life as a published poet). And the city where the book takes place is Kars, an actual city in northeastern Turkey. Ka is Turkish, though he has been living in Germany for years (there is a large Turkish population there), and Kars is going through some East-West conflicts too (the citizens of course desire to be separate from 'The West,' but also spend a great deal of time thinking of how The West sees them). Not only that, but both he and the city waver throughout the book between religious aversion and devotion (the religious party seems sure to win the next election until secular forces prevent that victory).. It is the religious identity conflict that seems to take up a lot of the book. Early on, one character remarks that 'in the old days' (i.e. Ottoman Empire days), Kars had been diverse but united. Then, outside forces had arrived and divided them into opposing camps. It was a little difficult, honestly, for me as someone from Midwestern America to read so many passionate defenses of headscarves on women, especially when the right -to- wear them is the rights issue at hand. Islam is a great and beautiful religion, but any interpretation that proclaims to require women to dress a certain way to avoid sin just seems obviously paternalistic-- in the same way that I don't approve the interpretations of Christianity that do that. An analogy I've heard is that women who have worn a headscarf for some time feel half-naked after removing it-- so a ban to them would be similar to if men were no longer allowed to wear shirts anywhere. My personal judgment (as an outsider, so perhaps it is too simplistic) is that such interpretations should be allowed, and people should be allowed to wear or not wear what they like-- but the situation in Kars has deteriorated to one where some people want to ban the wearing of headscarves altogether, while others continue to wear them in protest.. Which brings me to my next point, which is the audience that gets to observe and judge the identity crisis. In other words, for whose benefit are any of the actions taken by the characters to express themselves? For the newspaperman Serdar Bey, the truth is disregarded in favor of printing whatever he thinks will please his audience and get him the best circulation. For Kadife, one of the 'headscarf girls,' we can assume that she wears her scarf at least partially for her belief in God, but we also learn that she has a more immediate audience as well (Blue, the friendly local terrorist, with whom she's romantically involved and wants to impress). And of course there is the deranged actor Sunay, who takes advantage of the lack of travel in-or-out of Kars due to snow and creates a twisted meta-play that forces everyone in the town into a role as both an audience member and unwilling participant.. Orhan notes the (usually negative) influence of outside ideas on Kars, from the German pornography that weirdly affects Ka's relationship with Ipek to the growth of television viewership in Kars throughout the years. It's clear Orhan has his doubts about how much understanding is being ""exported"" from Kars, however. He quotes Fazil, one of the two young men who think they are psychically linked, at the conclusion of the novel: ""If you write a book set in Kars and put me in it, I'd like to tell your readers not to believe anything you say about me, anything you say about any of us. No one could understand us from so far away."". So as Orhan tried his best to understand Ka and couldn't quite complete his story without filling in the gaps based on conclusions from his own emotions, how can anyone from Midwestern America like myself truly understand the conflicts in a place like Kars without filling in the gaps with my emotions? It's a really challenging question, and one that brings me back to the snow on the cover. Since we're looking at a blurred photo, can we really tell anything about who the person is, or even anything about the snow itself? It might just be a nice smooth blanket as it seems, or maybe not. Perhaps people like me shouldn't judge too quickly, but also shouldn't stop trying to focus the picture a little more-- and maybe someday find the footsteps and direction of the person, whether it is Orhan or Ka, Ka or Kars.. * The analysis and thoughts I've recorded here don't even hit on some of the big themes of the book, which I suppose shows how dense with ideas it really is. The action may seem to slow down at times, but if you finish, you will find yourself with a lot to think about. With my own trip to Turkey coming in several months, this book has found an important place in my memory, imagination, and reasoning (the three types of poems Ka writes during his time in Kars).","Jun 29, 2012"
45586037,Dan Sihota,"Anyone who is after a nice, easy-to-read, book should avoid this one.. When I first decided to read Snow by Orhan Pamuk, I knew this wasn't going to be an easy read, and yes, it did require a great deal of effort on my part to finish. Having said that, this isn't a bad book by any means, it's just that it does help if you know what you're letting yourself in for. My main reason for choosing to read Snow is because of my huge interest in Turkey, and Orhan Pamuk is probably the most famous author from Turkey, so when I came across a copy of Snow, I decided to give it a go.. What makes this book enjoyable to read, as well as requiring a bit of effort, is the fact that it touches upon so many aspects of Turkish history, such as Ottoman-Russian rivalry, the Armenian Genocide, creation of the modern Turkish Republic, military coups, Kurdish separatism, but most importantly of all, the neverending struggle within Turkish society between secularism and the role of religion. I'm not sure if anyone unfamiliar with these aspects of Turkish history will be able to fully appreciate this book.. The story itself is fairly simple: a well-known Turkish poet returns to Turkey, after a period of exile in Germany, and heads to the border city of Kars where he finds himself caught up in the middle of a military coup. As we learn about the people involved in the coup, as well as those opposed to the coup, we learn about the complexities and contradictions which exist within Turkish society.. My only criticism would be that I felt the book was a little too long.. I recommend this book to anyone enjoys an intellectual read or anyone who is interested in learning a little about Turkish culture.","Apr 23, 2017"
75739688,JJ Shankar,"A mixed bag. I really wanted to enjoy this book, as it mixes many compelling elements -- an premise filled with political intrigue, rich accounts of history (both real and fictional) and issues within Turkish society (religion vs. secularism, East vs. West, intellectuals vs. commoners), whimsically satirical passages, metafiction, reflections on poetry, art, and love, and subtle threads of magic. I appreciated Pamuk's loving sketches of his characters -- a religious high school boy who questions his faith and aspires to be a science fiction writer, a patriotic actor who resents that his glory days have passed, and the main character Ka, a poet on a quest for happiness, whom I came to deeply identify with. Pamuk's descriptions mix Turkish culture, folklore, and pop culture with other influences, such as American and European cinema, in a pretty unique way. Yet the painstaking detail in which Pamuk constructs the world of his novel is also the novel's downfall. His frequent digressions disrupt any momentum in the story, eventually making the book a bit of a slog to work through. His prose comes across as more wordy and self-indulgent rather than lyrical. Could have been a great book had it been about 100-200 pages shorter.","Jun 28, 2020"
4794321,Frank Romagosa,"My first Pamuk. The novel though hard was not as bleak as might be thought. There was something so Beckett about the story, or maybe Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead. It was a play-within-a-play, the story of an exile returned not to Istanbul but to Kars, a town on the margins. In the center of Germany his writing has faltered, on the edge of the world it comes to life. Somewhere between tradition and secular modernism, life is amplified. And women are central, as their decision to uncover or remain veiled is a premise of that see-sawing world. Maybe the beauty of the novel is in various characters making do and making choices despite the challenges of being in such an out-of-the-way-place, though these choices and actions all seem on a stage. Suddenly and even just in time the story takes a momentous narrative shift - it becomes the best of absurd and so the perfect reflection of all that may be happening, in this world and that! Maybe we felt it coming, this turn, its execution is stunning and so well done! .. So much revolves on snow, the constancy of the snow, a metronome for this part of an ever larger world. The novel is beautiful and so worth the time.","Jun 27, 2017"
17429499,Wietse Van Ransbeeck,"There's no more enjoyable and atmospheric reading experience than devouring the last chapters in a snow-white Kars itself, the Eastern Turkish provincial town that provides the stage for 'Snow'.. This political novel, although written in the 90s, is still utterly relevant today. Actually, it only becomes more relevant since the hijab ban in schools and public services—at the root of the suicide wave of young female students in Kars, investigated by protagonist Ka—has been lifted, after the book's publication. And state-controlled newspapers as propagandists, writing the news the reader wants to read, is no longer just fiction in Turkey.. Turkey finds itself increasingly facing existential dilemmas: modernism vs. traditionalism, authoritarianism vs. democracy, kemalism vs. islamism, Kurds vs. Turks. Perhaps 'vs.' should be replaced by 'and'. Perhaps Turkey doesn't have to choose directions at each of these junctions and should consider fully embracing a pluralistic view on its heterogenous society, instead.. It is this melting pot of cultures, ethnicities, religions, beliefs, and their according identity politics, that makes Anatolia so fascinating—at its best narrated by Orhan Pamuk. Travelling through Eastern Turkey with Pamuk as my personal guide was an absolute delight.","Apr 22, 2019"
60459770,Mark Horvath,"Its been a while since I read this, so a second runthrough is in order in 2018. But for this title and author to stick with me beyond 8 or so years...there's got to be something there, right?. Snow blends poetry, romance, politics and yes, snow into an icy tale that doesn't always give you what you want. Many will hate that fact, because it ignores their convention of nice endings and overcoming obstacles. Such is what happens when the government and religion come into play and mess with the inter weavings of the poet. At its core, Snow has moments of beauty that fit the serene nature of its title. But it also has stark ugliness which can be comparative to a lashing blizzard with frigid values and endless darkness.. I'll update this review after my readthrough here in 2018, but from what I recall in 2009 turning these pages while a snow fell outside my window, Pamuk engages you and doesn't show his hand. The poet's prose leaves you feeling hopeful but the reality stacks the deck. A good read.","Dec 27, 2017"
56337123,Georgina Kelly,"this was a very interesting novel set in Turkey where an exile from a former regime returns to his homeland and finds himself disoriented and fatally clumsy. the emptiness he has experienced in the West during his exile he tries to redress in misguided attempts to find faith in a God that has always eluded him, romantic love with his best friend's ex-wife, tripping into the conflictual politics of secularism and religion and effectively condemns himself to another period of exile and death in exile. Can an individual smelling of the West ever return to the nest? can he even worship the same god as the people in whose shoes he does not and cannot walk? this is a book of irreconcileables, the ego always undermining the possibility of belonging. the chasms those living bbetween worlds fall into and the sacrifices that are taken from them as they fall.

67898203,David Small,"It's hard for me to enjoy translations, since I really can't plumb the subtleties of the writer's actual style, and for me that's an important part of the experience. The translation seems clumsy to me. It makes it doubly hard going, too, because the culture it reflects is so foreign to me. The novel does, though, reveal the excruciating tension that exists between secularists and religionists in this fraught land, and it foretells in its way the country's recent turning away from the West and its resurgent nationalism and pride in Islam and its traditional culture--and conveys to a telling degree Turkey's suspicions about anything or anyone European or American, accompanied by a paranoid sense of inferiority. It really drives home for me how hideous our behavior must appear to adherents traditional Islam (in fact, our popular culture seems pretty hideous to me as well.) This is clearly an important book politically and I wish I found the characters more compelling.","Apr 11, 2019"

5682659,Jennifer,"Beautifully written; I loved the way each chapter was almost a self contained story, yet still functioned as part of the overall plot. It reminded me of either an old fashioned novel or A Thousand and One Nights. I won't pretend that I understood the complicated politics presented, because I didn't. But I found the Eastern portrayal of Western thoughts enlightening, as well as the way they generalized and dismissed other factions in their own city. And the themes of love, jealousy, shame, and hatred are universal and handled really well. I really enjoyed this book, and definitely would like to read more by Pamuk.","Oct 01, 2017"
14504931,J. ,"Difficult to rate, I suppose it depends on what a book should be. Full of questions and starting points for interesting explorations on human arrogance(?), religion, faith, journalism, democracy, traditionalism, reformation etc., and its setting in Turkey’s turbulent social and political history was definitely fresh for my limited reading history/knowledge. But I cannot say I didn't find literary aspects of it contrived, so it was hard to appreciate the novel much further. Several stylistic choices and their execution were off-putting; I failed to warm up to characters and developments I suspected, perhaps wrongly, that the author intended or expected readers to feel affectionate towards (which only increased my dismissiveness). Perhaps my views will become more sympathetic upon further reflection — certainly, there were some hard-hitting paragraphs in it. Overall while I’m glad I decided to complete the book, I found that it didn’t live up to what its own narration seemed to promise.","Jan 02, 2018"

The author made himself a character in his own story, then tried to imply it was a biography even though it clearly says it's a novel.. The charactarization in this novel is terrible, the men are whinging, childlike and fall in love with every woman they see. The women are either drop dead gorgeous or fat, there is no realism at all.. Yes, I get this won the Nobel Prize for Literature but it wasn't for me at all.. Will I read again... NO.

7452536,Moira McPartlin,"This is not a book to be rushed. It is pretty dense but worth persevering with. Maybe it's the translation but it reminded me a bit of the novels of Ismail Kadare. Snow tells the story of a poet, Ka, who goes to a Turkish border town to investigate a suicide epidemic among young girls. The town is cut off by a blizzard and during that time a coup takes place. I found the tension between the different religious views and the lives of ordinary folk in Turkey fascinating.

You get to experience the follies of petty politics, of wrestling with the time-honored squabble of religious fundamentalism and secularism with all their corollaries vying for control but mind it, it is a double-edged sword, no winner in the end.

As one advances through the journey that this book is, it feels like one is gliding over the city on a nimbus cloud, anxiously watching over the blizzard there, and occasionally stopping down at those iconic tea-houses for a glass of raki, to muster some courage to go on.

2634423,TheGirlBytheSeaofCortez,"I loved Turkish novelist, Orhan Pamuk’s book. My Name is Red. . It was gorgeous; it was exquisite; it was elaborate; it was truly original. Save for the descriptions of the snow, itself,. Snow. doesn’t have the elegant beauty of. My Name is Red. and it’s far, far more political in nature. There’s nothing wrong with a book being political in nature, of course, but it’s just not my cup of tea. It took me so, so long to finish this book because I would read a little, find I just didn’t care, put it down, and often fall asleep.. While. My Name is Red. was set in the sixteenth century,. Snow. is set in the present day. It centers around an Istanbul poet, Ka, who’s been living in exile in Frankfurt, Germany for the past twelve years. However, as the book opens, Ka is on a bus heading to Kars, a mountain village in one of the poorest sections of Turkey, at the Russian border, to attend his mother’s funeral. And of course, it’s snowing, a snowfall that won’t stop until the book’s final page. (In Turkish, ""kar"" means ""snow.""). One of Ka’s friends, a journalist with an Istanbul newspaper, asks Ka to look into a very strange happening in Kars...the rash of suicides among the ""head scarf girls,"" girls who have been expelled from college for wearing a scarf to cover their heads after it’s been forbidden to do so.. Ka agrees to do a little sleuthing in Kars, but the mystery of the ""head scarf girls"" isn’t his primary motive, nor is helping his friend. Ka is hoping to be reunited with Ipek, a woman he knew during his days as a student, a woman he never really stopped loving, a woman whose sister, Kadife is...who else...the leader of the ""head scarf girls."" Once married, Ipek is now separated from her husband and lives in a dilapidated building known, fittingly, as ""The Snow Palace Hotel."". As the snow continues to fall, Ka does attempt to learn about the suicides of the ""head scarf girls,"" but he finds people are very reluctant to talk to him. He’s been living in the west for twelve years, after all, he’s far wealthier than the citizens of Kars, and he’s simply not trustworthy.. Eventually, Ka meets with an Islamic extremist named Blue and the convoluted plot of. Snow. begins to meander and take on a rather picaresque quality as Ka wanders from encounter to encounter during the raging snowstorm.. One of the book’s defects is the fact that Ka is such a dislikeable character. I can tolerate dislikeable protagonists, and when they are drawn well, they fascinate me, but Ka, for much of the book, acts like a spoiled child and not enough like a responsible, grown man. He’s. too. weak,. too. ineffectual. He doesn’t even know if he belongs to the East or to the West. This would be okay, if Ka were simply wrestling with his problem of identity, but he’s not. It’s almost as though he doesn’t care; he waffles, depending on who he meets.. Snow. is, of course, a symbolic book, almost an allegory of East-meets-West politics and Ka, because of his twelve years in exile, has come to symbolize the West. The snowstorm that blurs and isolates everything is symbolic of the blurring of both the East and the West in Kars, and of course, of Kars isolation.. Pamuk is an author who usually concentrates his efforts on male characters.. Snow. , however, is different. In. Snow. , Pamuk gives us two very strong female characters: Ipek and Kadife, in addition to the ""head scarf girls."" While I don’t care for feminist literature or ""chick lit,"" I liked this inclusion of strong female characters and think it deepened Pamuk’s work. And for all his childishness and naiveté, only Ka seems to realize that the ""head scarf girls"" are human beings and not a political or religious symbol.. To his enormous credit, Ka manages to see that like each snowflake is unique, each ""head scarf girl"" is also unique and irreplaceable and deserves to be treated as such.. While Pamuk never brings the elaborate plot of. Snow. to a truly satisfying conclusion, he does bring the village of Kars vividly to life in both its beauty and its squalor, and for me, at least, this was extremely interesting.. The conclusion is quite dramatic, almost melodramatic in nature, and instead of provoking the reflection that I’m sure Pamuk intended, it is almost comical. It’s also far too long, and its length detracts from its power. I think this is a book that would have been served well with the talents of a good editor. But, maybe that's just me. You could feel very differently about it.. Snow. is a very realistic novel, just about as different from the fantastic and glittering. My Name is Red. as one can get. It’s certainly a book worth reading, but save for the hauntingly rendered beauty of the snow and the sadness that permeates every corner of Kars, not much else in. Snow. lingers.","Aug 23, 2009"

The power struggle between the moderates & extremists on both the secular & religious sides is well depicted. Nobody is truly neutral in whatever field they operate in. If the book had stuck to that it would have, in my opinion, merited a 5 star review. Unfortunately, the painstaking literary angle (which allowed a lot of padding at the end in particular) added little. As long as Ka was a moderate secularist he could have been a bus driver rather than a poet & the book notably punchier as a result. Almost excellent but not quite.","Dec 10, 2018"

321314,Jeff Scott,"This story is more of a vehicle to explore the different characters and issues of Turkey. Islamists, Atheists, terrorist, westerners, and those caught in between are all explored. In the end, the author's message is that we don't really understand any of them, that there's no way to do so.. The main character, KA, drives the plot. He returns to Kars, Turkey, from Frankfurt Germany so that he can woo and marry the woman of his dreams who is recently divorced. The author builds up the story to root for Ka. However, three quarters of the way into this story, we know there isn't a happy ending for the protaganist. He doesn't get the girl, in fact, we find that he will be shot and killed four years after the main events of the story.. Why do that to your reader? That seems a little mean to suddenly break into the story and write something like, ""Oh by the way, I need to interrupt your story. You know the main character, it doesn't really work out for him. You're not really supposed to pay attention to him anyway. He is just a vehicle to say what I want to say about Turkey and the certain characteristics about its inhabitants."" This isn't an actual quote, I'm just summing up my feelings. However, when I finished the book, and you find what Ka does in order to secure his own happiness, I think he deserved to be shot.. The story is a good story because you have all these characters that have misconceptions about everybody else. No one really understands anyone. They all have these built up and romanticized stories or to villainize Islamists, Atheists, Westerners, and others. There is no middle ground, just ridiculous notions. The author himself even says his own story is one of them and not to believe any of it. You can pull that content from the passages below.. Passages. ""We're not stupid we're just poor and we have a right to want to insist on this distinction...Mankind's greatest error, the biggest deception of the past 1000 years is this, to confuse poverty with stupidity. Throughout history, religious leaders and other honorable me of conscience have always warned against this shaming confusion. They remind us that the poor have hearts, minds, humanity, and wisdom, just like everyone else. When hans hanson sees a poor man he feels sorry for him. He would not necessarily assume that the man's a fool who's blown his chances or a drunk whose lost his will. I can't speak for hans hanson, but that's what everyone thinks when they see a poor man.. People might feel sorry for a man who has fallen on hard times, but when an entire nation is poor the rest of the world assumes that all. its people must be brainless, lazy, dirty, clumsy, fools. Instead of pity, the people provoke laughter. It's all a joke. Their culture, their customs, their practices. In time the rest of the world may some begin to feel ashamed for having thought this way, and when they look around and see the immigrants from that poor country mopping their floors and doing all the other lowest paying jobs, naturally, they worry about what might happen if these workers one day rose up against them. So, to keep things sweet they start taking an interest in immigrant's culture and sometimes even pretend they think. of them as equals...When a westerner meets a foreigner from a poor country, he feels contempt. He assumes that the poor man's head must be full of all the nonsense that plunged his country into poverty and despair."" p. 300. p. 400. I turned backed to Fazil and asked him what he would say to my readers if ever I was to write a book set in Kars.. ""Nothing"", his voice was determined. When he saw my face fall, he relented.. ""I did think of something, but you may not like it."" he said. ""If you write a book set in kaas, and put me in it, I'd like to tell your readers not to believe anything you say about us, anything you say about any of us, no one could understand us from so far away."". ""But no one believes in that way what he reads in a novel."" I said. ""Oh YES they do"" he cried, ""If only to see themselves as wise and superior and humanistic. They need to think of us as sweet and funny and convince themselves that they sympathize with the way we are and even love us. But if you had put in what I just said at least your readers will put a little room for doubt in their minds.""","Aug 14, 2009"
9314075,Carl R.,"One of the jacket blurbs on the paperback edition of Orhan Pamuk’s Snow declares that the book heralds the return of the political novel. I don’t know that the political novel ever went away or, indeed, what a political novel is, exactly, but I do know that the phrase cannot contain this first-drawer work of literature.. Snow’s themes and ideas are complex enough to absorb seminars by themselves. Isolation--political, psychological, romantic, artistic--is but one of the concepts that is intertwined in the interior and exterior lives of the characters as well as the overall action of the novel. The concept of authority--where it rests and how it is exercised in government, families, friendships--moves the plot through the streets of the storm-isolated town of Kars where the novel is set. Kars itself is at once the place where nearly all the action occurs and a metaphor for Turkey and even for the emotional lives of the characters. The analyst who diagrammed the travels of protagonist Ka through its streets might be rewarded with meaning kin to Leopold Bloom’s meanderings through Dublin. And these don’t begin to exhaust what all could be termed main themes. The book is resplendent with them.. Literature itself is a main character. The protagonist Ka is a writer who has come to Kars ostensibly to report as a journalist (though he is primarily a poet) on the upcoming elections. He has endured a long creative dry spell, but his return to the town of his youth sparks new inspiration, and he writes a number of poems. The reader gets to see very little of their content, but the occasions for their composition are all integral to the movement of the action. And, once again, a study of their order and the circumstances under which they were written could consume a considerable course of study.. Important also, arguably the most important, is the title metaphor. Snow isolates Kars for most of the time the novel spends there. It controls the actions and thoughts of many of the characters. The pivotal events would be impossible without it. Artistically and psychologically, the structure of the snowflake becomes not only a figure for Ka’s interior life, but a diagram for universal system of thought, artistry, and psychology. Exploring its ramifications would reward a great deal study. Ka places his Kars poems, for example, in various locations on the diagram of the snowflakes six poles according to a system of concepts and emotions he has devised. And that system is meant to reflect no less than a structure of the universe. A cliche idea, I thought, to see the universe in a snowflake, no two of which are alike as we’ve been told and told and told. But Pamuk renders the whole idea marvelous.. Adding still another dimension to all this complexity is the narrator, who we think at first is the omniscient author, but who soon turns out to be someone who knows or has known the protagonist in the past, then turns out to be someone who is a bit of detective trying to sort out . . . but I’m giving too much away. The novel is in one sense a mystery along with all its other senses.. Finally, on the political/cultural level, westerners seldom get a chance at insight into the mind of the Muslim world. I’m not talking here about political posturing or slaughter of innocents or quaint costumes. I’m talking about a first-rate artist showing us what it means to live constantly with the idea that your culture is inferior, playing catchup with a world that has passed you by and judges you while glancing over its shoulder as it speeds far down the road ahead. It’s not an idea you necessarily accept or live by, but it permeates your world like a bad smell you can’t get rid of. Snow gave me some insight into why cultural understanding is so difficult to achieve, and it didn’t give me a great deal of hope that it was going to happen in the near future.. However, Snow did reinforce my conviction that art can transcend--at least for the space of a book or ballet or play or symphony--all the bombs and hatred-spewing presidents and Ayatollahs. And to anyone who cares to take the trouble the exploration of just this one work of Pamuk’s could last for years. I’m not going to dive in to that extent, but I am going to read more of this Nobel guy. Come back later and see what I come up with.","May 06, 2012"
1993309,Kristel,"Short synopsis: A story set in Kars, Turkey. Ka, a poet, visits on assignment to write about the suicides of young women. His reason for being there is Ipek who he plans to bring back to Germany as his wife. It is snowing……. Reactions: at first I wanted to like this story, it has been described as poetic and I think that is accurate for the first part of the book but it is also as boring as looking at a snow covered landscape devoid of color. I think the author had something going by using the snow to describe the experience of Ka but then it just “melted”. At first, I felt resentment. I did not like that the Islamist kept telling others how they were thinking. It made me hate this religion. There is no grace or mercy here. Its hard for me to understand the intolerance for Christianity and the blindly tolerant view of Islam. Then there was some enlightenment. The mixed messages that people living in Kars receive through communism or socialism, Islam, etc was evident. The girls raised to wear a scarf, taught that it was expected in their religion and then told to “take the scarf off”. The confusion caused by the mixing of politics with religion and the manipulation used by the various parties. No one seemed to think it was wrong to lie and to harm others if it promoted the agenda.. I first I thought I could like Ka but I could not. I could understand wanting to meet up with a former acquaintance and propose and get married. I think that is an okay goal but when he started being devious and manipulative in his endeavors, then I no longer was happy with him. The interest in pornography had also crippled him, in my opinion. He was a weak man and in the end he just went too far with his jealousies.. The authors purpose: Mr Pamuk states that he wanted to write a novel that would explore the political conflicts in Turkey. He used a small town to give a microcosm view of the whole. He discusses in the postscript how difficult it is to write a political novel about this area and apparently there were political persecutions for which he had to hire a lawyer. The book involved a not of careful editing. The author is a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2006. His partner is the author, Kiran Desai.. Why is it included in 1001 Books you Must Read Before You Die? Is there anything that this book adds to the development of the novel? I suspect that because this is a work that looks at political Islam, clash of Western and Islam and that the author is Turkey that this book is unique. The use of lyrical prose and the technique where the author writes himself into the story is not unique. Characters were frequently stereotypes. Ka was developed. The other characters represented certain characters and classes in the microcosm of Turkey. The language did create the scene, the use of snow was ‘smart’ in keeping everyone contained in this drama for three days and the tone was set by the snow. The book had emotional impact though not necessarily positive for me. I am glad to be done. I think the author probably deserved the Nobel Prize for literature for being able to write this controversial and potentially risky novel.. I also wanted to add this quote; ""If only to see themselves as wise and superior and humanistic, they need to think of us as sweet and funny, and convince themselves that they sympathize with the way we are and even love us."" page 442. I think this is very true (but not for me). I don't like their religion or their politics.","Apr 27, 2014"
1455091,Ryan,"Seems appropriate for a 4-day snow day from school... Plus I've been wanting to read another Islamic account of life in the Middle East besides Kite Runner and Thousand Splendid Suns.... _______________________________________________________________________. Boring… Oh my God, I'm so glad I'm done... I have no idea how to go about my response to this book. I so disliked it that I don’t even feel like taking the time to detail and justify every reason why. I felt absolutely nothing throughout – nothing for the characters (whom I thought were lifeless, with nothing to back them up), nothing for the plot (which was not suspenseful, had no momentum, and frankly seemed hard to keep track of with the Turkish names, places, and the guise of the theater crew running a [real?] coup), and nothing for “the cause” (which I couldn’t even decipher).. I was so excited to read a “real” portrayal of Islamic culture after my disappointment with “The Kite Runner” and “A Thousand Splendid Suns.” I thought those two novels were too popularized, not as piercing as they could be, not as poetic and psychologically insightful as could be – (though I CERTAINLY found out how offended douche-bag fans of Hossieni could be if you do not agree with their love and infatuation…) However, I’m almost MORE disappointed with this, having had such higher expectations.. You would think that a love story set in the time of Islamic Revolution in the Middle East would be a dynamic, captivating, exciting story. However, I felt like nothing was believable in this. There was a coup – where performers openly fire on an audience – that doesn’t seem plausible; there was a love story – where our protagonist falls in love within seconds and then proceeds to act romantically robotic to her and with her; there was a main character who, as a poet, seemingly found his way into every single turn of events – really? The poet? So crucial to life, the revolution, religious leaders, feminists, the secret police? Everything must pass though him? Even the Islamic struggle didn’t really feel as sure and powerful as the news on TV lately does. Yes, there is the government, the religious leaders, the feminists – but their struggles seemed “dumbed down” or simplified or reduced to stereotypes, simple symbols, or just accepted as “common belief.” The women fight for 400 pages over the right to kill themselves or to take scarves off their heads. The Islamists think anyone who doesn’t want to follow Sharia Law is an atheist and they won’t speak to them. Our main character walks around aimlessly waiting for poems to miraculously come to him, all while solving the crisis everyone has around him.. I don’t know…. I’m not even sure I’m representing this 100% correctly, but just like when I was reading the book, I don’t care. I wasn’t drawn in enough to follow it, or care enough to follow it. I should have stopped after page 200 but I can’t leave a book unfinished. But this seriously took me twice as long to get through as a normal book, I seriously fell asleep while reading countless times, and I finally just “sped read” through each sentence/paragraph to get through it as fast as possible. How is it possible that a book with this subject matter could not come across to the reader in a more urgent, gripping, dynamic fashion? I'm still looking for an accurate, moving, poetic look at the Islamic countries we hear so much about nowadays...","Feb 02, 2011"
6652736,Dima Lababidi,"Snow by Orhan Pamuk was one of those books that change your perspective entirely about wars, military coups, political and religious leaders who think they’re powerful and really just how human everyone around us is. I loved Necip and the charcoal station dog and the effect the snow left on everything it touched, but I hated the snow itself, and I don’t hate Ka, I really think he’s so human. No wonder Pamuk won the Nobel Prize for this novel. He’s a master of story telling and painting images for the readers. This is always gonna be one of my top 10 favorite books.","Jan 01, 2019"
1086452,Dia,"One of the back-cover blurbs (by John Updike) uses the word ""tonic"" to describe this book, a descriptor I don't remember ever seeing applied to a written work but which immediately provoked an appetite for this one. In the end, I didn't really feel that this book was a tonic -- I'm not sure that it's even possible for literature to be tonic, interesting though that prospect is.. Nonetheless, this book has much to recommend it. It's set in contemporary Turkey, a place that, as the Turks in this book are well aware, we Americans and other Westerners know little about. The book is far from didactic or moralistic; in fact it probably falls more onto the absurdist side of things, albeit tempered by moments of yearning and near-fulfillment that might be called romantic (although those moments come in an unnervingly clockwork manner: every time something frightening happens, the man we are following notices the beautiful snow, recalls his lover, or writes a pristine poem -- but these romantic moments are almost more like the tics of a person tormented by an unpredictable punisher than they are the effusions of a daisy-picking universe-communer).. The guiding question of this book is universal, not particular to Westernized Islamic countries, as is expressed in the following dialogue:. ""...Listen to me: Life's not about principles, it's about happiness."". ""But if you don't have any principles, and if you don't have faith, you can't be happy at all,"" said Kadife.. ""That's true. But in a brutal country like ours where human life is cheap, it's stupid to destroy yourself for the sake of your beliefs. Beliefs, high ideals -- only people living in rich countries can enjoy such luxuries."". ""Actually, it's the other way round. In a poor country, the only consolation people can have is the one that comes from their beliefs."". The book certainly shows people, and not just poor people, looking for consolation in every possible place and not achieving it in any lasting way, changing their commitments as they become disillusioned or as it becomes politically necessary to do so. This endless identity- and happiness-seeking activity seemed familiar enough to this Westerner.. Perhaps more particular to its locale, the characters in this book display a palette of emotional response that I would guess is foreign to, or perhaps suppressed by, most Westerners. That people can be truly terrified that they might become atheists; that people can be truly ashamed that they are whatever nationality they are; that the dominant experience one has of love is the near certainty that one will lose the beloved: These were some recurring emotional responses of characters in this book that English-speaking readers might not identify with but will be drawn toward by the passion and precision of the writing.. For all the absurdity, sociopolitical provocations, and despair contained in this book, it is somehow not a gloomy tome. Perhaps it's the snow lacing the pages, or the invisible poems, that do provide some tonic to help one digest this book. Though the book (like this review!) is a bit too long, the whiffs of Kundera, Murakami, and even Raymond Chandler, keep it moving. It's a skillful author whose very serious book feels so light in one's hands.","Dec 13, 2009"
10706328,Nethra Ram,"Unfortunately my first DNF this year. I've been wanting to read this book for quite some time and I was initially blown away by the poetic writing and the grim circumstances bring discussed. But the grand welcome stops right there.. 1. I don't think you'll understand the various standpoints in this book, without having a prior knowledge of the religious and political differences underlined as a lifestyle in Kars. Without those hints you'll have a tough time rounding up who supports whom before you can even decide if someone's reasoning is justifiable. This becomes a major problem as the book progresses because it'll just plainly confuse you.. 2. I like the idea of including the author as a character in the book...I do not know if the narrator friend is the author himself because I didn't finish it, but this guy gets very annoying at times. When the point of view suddenly shifts in the middle of a tense situation, to first person, the friend telling you he hasn't seen Ka in years, or something equally unimportant, you'll want to tell him 'Shh dude, will you just shut up for a moment?' Plus, having Ka's sexual feelings described in the words of a friend, is in my opinion a little gross.. 3. The conflict and confusion that Ka faces, I felt, were not strung together convincingly. There's atleast a dozen obvious ones - visiting his homeland after so long, realizing the situation is building up towards something unpleasant not to mention everything as he knew it has changed already, pent-up emotions, unrequited love, decisions to make about fight or flight, the guilt that comes with it, religious faith etc. All these bubbles just hang in mid air, not being dealt with in full and therefore not weaving together a landscape you'd want to explore and understand. (I wonder if this is because of the translation.). 4. Speaking of landscapes, the use of snow, beginning with the title and as a backdrop for the story is a fantastic idea, the umpteen interpretations that can be applied to snow, the metaphors that can be drawn. Sadly, it becomes an overdose after a certain point and quite bland when it becomes repetitive and literal. Something on the lines of 'The snow is beautiful. Did you watch the snow from the window? They are talking about the snow on TV. Hey, did I mention how beautiful the snow falls?' We get it. Its snowing. Why did all those people in the theatre get shot?. Ka catches your attention only in the beginning when he seems like a man of purpose; afterall he is a journalist who is investigating the suicides in the city. But beyond a few chapters he loses track, other characters keep flitting in and out, each with veiled romantic notions and opinions of their own that you don't know fact from fiction anymore. It is as if, Ka, your tour guide for the journey disappeared down a snowed-in road leaving you in the midst of hawkers who're swarming around trying to sell you souvenirs, you who don't speak the language or know your way around. You call after him but he just leaves you with a parting comment - The snow is beautiful. Did I mention it is snowing? You just stare at him as you pull your layers closer and brush off a fleck of white from the end of your nose.. Maybe I'll find the patience to finish this one some other time.","Dec 21, 2013"
23826312,Nina,"This book was more subtle than most in my rotation, leaving me uncertain until almost the end about whether I was following the author’s intentions or artificially superimposing my own [Western, Millennial, Progressive] values and interpretations. It was like trying on a garment and not being able to tell if the fit was off because the design is poor, I picked up the wrong size, or the garment fits the way it’s supposed to but the look is just not one I think of as flattering. AKA – is the problem Orhan Pamuk? Is it me – am I just not getting it? Or are we looking at cross-cultural differences – am I negatively judging a character for behavior that the author meant to be inoffensive?. Spoiler: the answer is (d) none of the above. 77 pages before the end, Pamuk finally owns up that he’s been messing with the reader’s head purposefully: “. For the first time since his arrival in Kars, Ka felt the peace of righteousness: At long last, the villain was talking like a villain, saying all the vicious things that villains say, and this cleared his head.. ”. This novel works very hard to avoid all the tropes, key words, and stereotyped behaviors that we rely on to get our bearings with regards to strangers and new characters. We lean on those tropes to determine relatively quickly whether someone is good, bad, interesting, selfish, naïve, etc. Scrubbed of those tropes, Pamuk’s world is disorienting – can I trust my narrator? Who’s the good guy? She’s clearly holding something back – does that make her forlorn and heartrending or potentially threatening? The goal is to force the reader to encounter the characters in their full humanness, without pre-judging them based on dogma or creed. Kind of like in real life: we never think of ourselves as villains, nor would we describe ourselves that way to another. Absent the dead giveaways like maniacal laughs or threatening monologues, what makes someone a villain? Given that “Snow” takes place in Eastern Turkey and the characters include an underground terrorist, fundamentalist muslim youth, an authoritarian semi-fascist coup leader, a police state comfortable with torture, ex-Communists, and Westernized political exiles, the fact that I couldn’t be comfortable in my character judgments is a major achievement on Pamuk’s part.. Since 9/11, we Westerners have been exposed to political postulating about fundamentalist Islam, terrorism, theocracies, and authoritarian responses – these are the issues that elections are run on, these are the issues over which we go to war. However, in the last scene in “Snow,” the author asks one of the characters whether he has a message to pass on to the novel’s [presumably Western and/or cosmopolitan] readers. The character replies that “. No one could understand us from so far away.. ” Indeed.. So I need to read it again.. Follow up:. this. is a great review. Ignore the ""spoiler"" rating, go ahead and read it. Among other insights, the review acknowledges that the quality of the book is not correlated to whether you'd be interested in having a beer with the narrator. Who may or may not be as infuriatingly anxty and self-involved as Hamlet.","Mar 19, 2016"
23818026,Kshitiz Goliya,"Everything has politics, my professor once told me. While reading Snow, I realized the true value of that statement.. Turkey has always been torn between Islamists and military backed secularists. The recent coup attempt was in line with many that preceded it.. Whenever an Islamist party becomes powerful and thus tries to project Islam more forcefully, there is a section that lashes back, albeit through non-democratic means.. The tolerance for coups in some parts of Turkish society has made sure that they are still an option resorted to by military, whenever it feels the government of the day is diverging from the unwritten principles of Ataturk.. Snow is the story of a poet, Ka, who returns to Turkey from his exile in Germany and goes to a small town, Kars. Behind his trip was hidden the desire to see a woman named Ipek whom he secretly loved during his student days and who later married and subsequently divorced his other friend.. He masquerades as a journalist on assignment and enters Kars amidst a snowy winter at its full might. His supposed focus of inquiry is the suicide girls. These girls, for reasons that Ka tried finding but could never be clear, gave up their lives in quick successions. The act alarmed the society and brought the focus of elite press from the capital.. With suicide being a crime in Islam, were these women, who were generally suppressed in Islam, using suicide as an act of defiance? Or was it out of pure desperation and despair?. It didn't matter after some time as Ka started to get pulled into the town's life and contradictions.. Soon he met the women he had deeply and secretly loved, which combined with conflict in the city, brought within him a swell of thoughts that opened the way for some of his best poems.. Islam and atheism, communist and Islamist, love and betrayal; he had to deal with all these extremes during his stay in Kars and still he was happiest for Ipek requited his love.. At the same time, he saw an old man being shot closely followed by a successful local coup attempt, each event pulling him deeper into the whirlwind of city's politics and the associated conspiracies.. Ka, like every human, cherished the secret longings of happiness and imagined it to be in a married life with Ipek. He saw it in both of them walking down the streets of Berlin, away from the tumult of Turkey.. Ka constantly took refuge in the beauty of snow, in its constant and gradual descent as well as pure whiteness.. However, at the back of his mind was always a fear that happiness will slip out of his fingers and melt like the constantly falling snow flakes in the streets of Kars.. He soon realized that happiness is like a snow flake, beautiful and pure, but equally fragile, ready to disappear as soon as it is within grasp.. The secret police within the city, on the lines of Stasi and KGB, closely followed Ka with its spies and bugs all over the town. He ends up running against them, out of his love for Ipek and encounters certain truths that shatter his dream of a happy married life in Berlin.. Ultimately, as the winter recedes and snow melts, so does his dreams of happiness. He leaves Kars alone in the train, Ipek left behind. Happiness for him was short lived.","Oct 12, 2016"

140203,Brian,"Poetically political, this novel focuses on the rather current debate in modern Turkey over whether to be more Western or to be more Eastern. Choosing the former means progress, democracy, ""freedom"", etc., but at the potential loss of a national identity rooted in cultural/religious ties to the Islamic world. The stage for the debate is the remote city of Kars, which is about to be isolated from the rest of the country by an oncoming snowstorm. Enter the poet Ka, who comes to Kars ostensibly to investigate the phenomenon of Islamic university women committing suicide for having to remove their headscarves in order to attend the univesities, but whose reasons for staying quickly turn purely romantic and nostalgic. Indeed, snow to him has a powerfully romantic and nostalgic effect, while for everyone else it is simply a nuisance; for, when a coup suddenly takes place during a play at a theater (art and politics blend continually throughout the novel), the city is unable to receive any help from the national government due to the heavy snowfall.. While snow has significant poetical meaning for Ka, which the narrator explains in detail in several chapters, it really functions in the book as a metaphor of fate. For snow can fall gently and beautifully, and be wonderful to watch or dance or play in, or it can fall forcibly, and quite limit one's scope of activity. The more political the characters are, the less they appreciate the snow; these characters seek to control the course of events, and the snowfall prevents them from doing so. The less political (and really this only means Ka plus a few others to a certain extent), the more snow is just a part of life; something that can be looked at beautifully if one is not seeking to control the natural course of events for one's own purposes.. Thus does the story seem to suggest (albeit very slightly, kind of like the falling of snow) that, to some extent or another, the course of historical events is really outside of any one individual or one group's control; there is always something more powerful at work. These individuals and groups certainly play a role (as in a play--solutions to political problems are sought out twice in the form of a play in this novel) in the shaping of that history, but it is not really they who shape history; history shapes them.. Will Turkey become more Eastern or Western? That question almost seems pushed aside by the larger question of how the answering of that question will affect the players involved. Will they be like the young, politically-charged characters, whose lives end abruptly either by their own hand or by someone else's? Or will they be like Ka, who pursues a more personal beauty in life, who stands by and watches the natural course of change in his country, seeking to capture it in verse, who only becomes incidentally involved in the political events by his pursuit of love (of which he is bereft by those same political events).. This is truly a complicated novel, and yet its themes and ideas are tied together so intricately and delicately; rather like a snowflake.","Jun 01, 2008"
75617629,Christabel Terence,"A novel on religion, identity and happiness, one that shines in its multiple perspective approach to secularism, Islam and the West. A fast-moving and engrossing novel of intellectual depth that may disappoint slightly in its final few chapters.","Dec 31, 2018"
9281934,Louise,"Ka, a visitor to his rural and poor hometown of Kars in Turkey, is sought after by many for his presumed access to the German (""European""/""Western"") press. He is also protected by this and while he will be questioned, he will not be tortured.. His position, as a possible conduit to an outside world, reveals the contradictions within the characters. Political Islam is their proxy for inferiority and other complex emotions about ""The West"". (One young man dreams of eating well on the lap of a blonde western woman). The headscarf is a symbol of solidarity... and a powerful symbol it is in Kars. The town is gripped by the tension and drama surrounding a prominent woman's potential removal of her scarf (will she or won't she?) and to a lesser degree by the question of who killed the administrator of the local university tasked by ""Istambul"" with enforcing the ban on headscarves.. Ka says he is investigating the suicides of the ""headscarf girls"", who are the real victims of this political culture, for a story in a German periodical. While Islamists ponitificate on the pitiable piety of the suicide girls, Ka finds other motives. These motives show a paternal willingness to marry off, abuse or otherwise sacrifice their daughters that reflects the same attitude that pressures them to wear the scarves. The sad situation of the girls, caught between their desire for an education, their need to belong and their families' desire to control them is never expressed by the girls (except by their suicides)... only by those who presume to speak for them.. In ""Red"" the characters introduce themselves through their first person chapters. Here, in a similar technique characters disclose themselves through first person dialog in which they reveal their personal conflicts, ambivalences and often a sense of defeatism.. The book is written in a different first person, but there is only a hint of this in the beginning. I'm glad Pamuk resisted the temptation to give us intricate folk tales nested inside the stories as he did in ""Red"".. This is a beautifully crafted portrait. While it defines a specific culture in rural Turkey, there is a wider metaphor for social groups left behind.I hope this book finds its way to academic reading lists. It deserves a wide and thoughtful audience.. It's like ""Red"", is a warm up for ""Snow"". I hope ""Snow"" is another warm up for more and equally powerful literature by Pamuk.","Dec 28, 2014"
40489794,Jo-Lynne Lockley,"Nobel Prize winner Orham Pamuk describes the complexities of European / Islamic relations and perceptions through the character of once exiled middling journalist and poet Ka who finds himself snowed-in in the once grand and now deteriorating Turkish city of Kars. Ka, who has been sent there by a Turkish paper published in Germany to cover suicides apparently connected to a debate over banning head scarves and who carries memories of a woman from the days of his rational youthful political involvement, finds himself caught in an inescapable crucible where Eastern fundamentalist misperceptions and misguided and ham handed government attempts to hold a backwater to the urban secular state colide in a bizarre conflagration of art or at least the artistic ego pretending to art meets politics and military force. The resulting total collapse of rational and civil society in a farsical political military artistic microcosm brings out the worst in Ka, whose whose hitherto writers block constipated poetry begins to flow with neither restraint nor reflection due, as he feels, alternately to the snow or the beautiful Ipek as muse. As Ka's artistic delusions and infatuation with Ipek increase his moral compass fails, so that his self interested actions lead to the loss of his dreams and not a few deaths. A thread of Ka's inner conflict between the rational secularism he has embraced all his life, the enthrallment with Islam thread through the entertainly absurd tale without informing his actions or decisions.. The characters with whom Pamuk populates the story are magnificent cartoons of the worlds of political military intrigue and pseudo art, which acts as a justification for the barbary into which Ka allows himself to be drawn.. The language is straight forward and hardly lyrical. It's in translation, after all. I find it hard to see the book as a satire, although it paints a persiflage of political / religious fanatics, madmen and expedient remoras. It is funny. Or at least amusing. Only after putting the book down and letting the managerie and chaos settle does one sense that the situation Pamuk creates is hysterical, but hardly to laugh at.. Pamuk foreshadows the turning points and end of the novel well before he relates actual events, making it less of a page turner (it still is...knowing what happened one is eager to see how it happened).. For me it had the feel of the illegitimate child of Death in Venice and Wag the Dog..not a bad thing, all in all.","Dec 10, 2015"

I decided years later that I'd been happy as a child, but the truth is, I wasn't. On the other hand, I was not unhappy in the way I was during the years that followed. I just wasn't interested in happiness at first."" 285. ""All over the world - even in America - the newspapers tailor the news to their readers' desires.

2609937,Lynne Norman,"I honestly don't know where to start with my review of this novel. I suppose I can begin by saying that I didn't like it - despite the fact I really, really wanted to. The only problem is I find it hard to put my finger on why I didn't like it - as I generally relish reading post-modern writing, such as this, where it is less about the novel's narrative arc than it is about the many layers and themes. It frustrates me that I didn't like this book - because I then feel as though I must have missed something, and I don't like the feeling that maybe I just didn't 'get' it.. Perhaps it was the protagonist himself - Ka - that turned me off? He is a very immature and selfish individual, with borderline sociopathic tendencies. I believe the reader was supposed to see him as a naive and pure artist, perhaps, but instead I found him cold and one dimensional. Maybe it was the cast list as a whole that I found problematical - consisting, as it did, of many one-dimensional people, who never seemed to react to events or conversations in the way that normal, and therefore complex, human beings would (Maybe that was the point? Who knows? Not me). It could have been the representation of women as there wasn't one strong female character I could identify with - again, as this is a book narrated from a male perspective, this could have been a commentary on how Turkish women are viewed by the men around them - but it's not a clearly made comment if that's the case.. On the positive side, Pamuk's prose is on occasion beautiful and he does a very good job of conjuring up a sense of place and atmosphere. It's enough to make me a little sad that not one of the poems written by Ka through this tale makes an appearance in the book. That said, I do understand that, again, that's kind of the point - the poems represent the key to understanding another human being's psyche (in this instance, the narrator Orhan Pamuk's understanding of his lost friend Ka) and the failure to unearth these poems speaks to the fact we can never truly understand the people we are close to (or at least I think that's what it represents!).. I think it speaks volumes that the reviews for this book tend to swing widely from love to hate. Unfortunately, I definitely tend towards the latter.","Oct 09, 2010"
4007077,Sarahlynn,"My apologies for the erratic weather we've had so far this year. I recently realized that it's all my fault.. See, in December a friend gave me a novel called Snow by Turkish author Orhan Pamuk. As I read it in fits and starts, it took me a really really long time to finish. But I'm finally done! And so now the snow can stop and spring can commence in earnest.. You're welcome.. As for why it took me so long to finish this book, well, that's all me I suppose. I kept flipping back to the front cover to verify that the seal on the front proclaiming, ""Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature!"" was still there and not just something I dreamed.. Later, I'd turn the book over and peruse the blurbs again. ""One of the best books of the year"" according to just about everyone from The New York Times Book Review to The Economist. Rave reviews from truly impressive people.. Repeatedly I read the jacket copy. ""Slyly comic."" Also, ""humor,"" ""wicked grin,"" etc.. I was excited to read this fabulous book, which came so highly recommended and is set in Turkey. (My in-laws lived in Turkey for years and my husband was actually born there; they returned to the states when his sister was ready for elementary school.). But I just didn't get it. I didn't engage with the story, I didn't connect with the characters, and I felt frustrated by the pace. (The first day seemed to me like it must have been at least 48 hours long. Is Ka really in his late 30's as it appears? If so, how come the 17+ year age difference between close sisters Ipek and Kadife is never discussed?) I utterly missed the humor.. Obviously, this is all on me since apparently everyone else who's read Snow loved it. But I spent the first 200 pages trying to figure out why the author gave most of the unrelated main characters the same last name (Bey). Then I figured it must be a subtle comment on the provincial nature of Turkish society (the cerebral humor I'd been missing?). By page 300 I'd realized that ""Bey"" must be a sort of honorific (and it is). Some of my confusion might indeed have been cultural. I certainly feel like an uncultured ignoramus for my utter failure to appreciate this highly acclaimed novel.. But I finished it, and now it's spring!","May 06, 2011"
17248131,Michael Battaglia,"In keeping with the ""themes without really trying"" theme, I apparently to arrange to read three books about a fictional present day version of the Ottoman Empire and then right afterwards read a book about what the Ottoman Empire later evolved into today. That . . . wasn't intentional.. But while Grimwood's trilogy was set in a present day version of Alexandria, Egypt, Pamuk's book is set in Turkey itself. Weirdly, both involve investigating deaths but while one is attempting to do a SF noir, Pamuk is going for something a bit more in depth, even if his also features two people who should be together but refuse to be for a variety of excuses.. For those who have never encountered him, Pamuk is a Turkish novelist and probably the best known Turkish writer outside of Turkey, having won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006. Having made a name for himself internationally with ""My Name is Red"", this was the follow up novel (and I think his second published in English) and both on some level deal with tensions between the East and West, here highlighted by the poet Ka, who is an expat living in Frankfurt, Germany for years and who travels to the Turkish border city of Kars in a journalistic capacity to investigate a spate of suicides of young girls. The word is they killed themselves rather than be forced to remove their headscarves, something that might strike a person as a somewhat frivilous reason to kill yourself. But spend a little time in the ""Context is Everything"" department and you get an idea how meaningful the issue is to people. At the time of Turkey's founding it was considered a secular state and thus the wearing of headscarves was discouraged, later on becoming outright banned in public places after around 1980. For a country with a devout Muslim population this didn't always sit well and in the case of the students in the novel it was banned at all schools and unversities, leading to the protests discussed before the action in the novel starts. Its a debate that still goes on today, as Turkey's current prime minister campaigned on it although Turkey's high court seems to have put the kibosh on any attempts to lift it as recently as 2008.. Needless to say, its not a trifling issue to the people in the novel and as Ka enters the city just as its cut off by a massive snowstorm, you figure either one of two things will happen . . . Lovecraftian monsters will emerge from the blizzard or a whole lot of life-altering drama is about to happen. As it turns out, Ka probably should have wished for Cthulu.. His initial reason for going as a journalist falls apart pretty quickly as his early rounds of questioning don't get him much of anywhere but fortunately his backup reason is fairly compelling as well . . . an opportunity to start fresh with a woman he used to be in love with, now recently divorced. Trapped in the city adn staying at her father's hotel, all Ka can hear is Bad Company's greatest hit playing on constant repeat in his head, alternating with a rush of poems that have to do with being trapped in a city where no one seems to like him or each other, and often express that through long debates or by firing guns. Sometimes, for variety, its both.. Its a very dreamlike novel at times, trapped in a strange kind of stasis as everyone runs around making their arguments while the snow constantly falls and political conditions take a strong swing toward ""armed insurrection"". Having been away for a while and living in Germany Ka is seen as a Westerner, something that everyone loves reminding him about as often as they can and highlighting probably Ka's biggest stumbling block (and maybe ours) in trying to salvage anything he can out of this situation . . . he just doesn't understand these people.. Its that lack of understanding that underlies almost every bad decision he makes, intentionally or otherwise. Faced with a variety of nationalist, Islamic and secular factions, all of whom have pretty strong ideas on how things should be done, Ka tries to thread a needle with the kind of rope that docks a ship and gets the kinds of results you'd expect. It doesn't help that almost everyone is okay with a body count . . . an early murder happens quickly before Pamuk takes us back to the excruciating discussion beforehand, all the time the outcome hanging about in the back of our heads. A later massacre is horrifying in how it feels like a dream and how pointless it seems, with soldiers firing on a crowd and us being warned who will die before the bullets hit. As it goes on, everyone is sure they're right but it seems the ones willing to go the furthest will be the ones to carry the day, at least until the snow clears and the local authorities restore order.. Its a postmodern novel, which means it can be a bit emotionally chilly at times . . . Ka and Ipek's rekindling of their relationship can be touching but there's always a bit of distance in everyone's feelings, like the cold from the snow has made everyone a little bit numb. Ka as a main character isn't the most dynamic force, once the suicide investigation falls off the map so does almost all his momentum for driving the plot and from then he's carried by events when he's not wooing Ipek to the point where you almost want to ask the guy to get a room inside his room. Also, just for giggles, Pamuk places himself as the narrator doing his own investigation of Ka's life before and after the events in Kars, which means sometimes the narrative stops or changes shape as we're given access to events that Ka doens't know about yet or details about what later happens to him and the other characters.. It makes for a novel that probably has the same snowflake structure of Ka's lost book of poems, one where all the delicate places are connected but only last as long as the storm holds out. People hoping to see a ride through the underbelly of a town's political and religious frictions may be a little disappointed how much of the back portions of the book are given to preparation for a provocative play but its what happens around those preparations that makes the novel finally frost over. We're never given the resolution to some of the mysteries in the story but that only seems fitting. What the novel seems to be best trying to figure out is how to understand each other, how our points of view can coexist even when those points don't seem to include other people, how a simple piece of clothing or its removal can mean the world to someone. Ka goes home to a foreign country, from a place that everyone treats like another planet and in the end the only way to understand is by imposing your own filters to make the differences digestible, which isn't really understanding at all. And maybe the ones who really get it are those able to articulate that disconnect but unfortunately no one probably understands them either.","Jul 28, 2018"
310423,penelopewanders,"The best part about reading this book is that practically the whole time I was reading it, it was snowing like crazy here in the mountains. So every now and then I could gaze out the window just like Ka.. Other than that I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. I had first heard of this author when I was remotely involved with a European Young Readers' Award ceremony - My Name is Red was one of the six books shortlisted for the prize. I had ordered all six, but Pamuk's book did not arrive before the meeting so I didn't get to read it ahead of time. Later I tried to send it down to our country place to read at some point on holiday, but it was stolen out of our car (with about twenty-five other TBRs!!) while the car was parked waiting for the ferry. So I haven't read that one which I was very intrigued by. When I saw this offered as a bookcrossing ring, I signed up right away.. At times I very much enjoyed this, but after a while felt like I was looking into a mirror across from a mirror and the multiple reflections were dizzying in the long run. There was a certain amount of poetry, but when I tried to discern a piece of writing I found really moving or beautiful, I could never quite put my finger on anything - like trying to hold onto a snowflake - at the end my fingers were just wet, but there was nothing I could really say, ""yes, this I really like."" I could not identify with the characters, neither male nor female - the constant pessimism of the hero was wearying,the women seemed calculating and one dimensional. Knowing ahead of time so much of what would happen was an interesting approach, but it added to the mirror within mirror effect.. Looking out at the snow falling as I write this, I can say I did enjoy the descriptions of the snow and the feeling of isolation. I was glad of the opportunity to read this.","Jan 18, 2012"
4308977,Vera Sophia,"As a woman who is also a muslim I am deeply drawn to the theme of this novel. The conflict between East v.s West, the struggle of identity, the unnecessary politicization of our religion and of course the obsession on what women should wear or not wear on their heads, are all too familiar. The issues of (muslim) women discussed in this book like the need to have a say on the control of our bodies, how we are turned into pawns in political game, really resonate with me. It is also fascinating to read about the characters which could easily be seen as one-dimensional in a more humanistic light, the handsome Islamist Blue who I can't really decide to hate nor like, Kadife who wears veil as an act of rebellion, or Necip the religious student who is bordering on atheism. Like all Pamuk's books, Snow posseses a distinct melancholic feeling which I love. With a sprinkle of (tragic) romance it is almost a perfect book for me.. I would end this review with a passage from the end of the book:. 'If you write a book set in Kars and put me in it, I'd like to tell your readers not to believe anything you say about me, anything you say about any of us. No one could understand us from so far away'. ...'If only to see themselves as wise and superior and humanistic, they need to think of us as sweet and funny, and convince themselves that they sympathise with the way we are and even love us. But if you would put in what I've just said, at least your readers will keep a little room for doubt in their minds.'. Thank you for another beautiful ending Mr. Pamuk, also for reminding me not to be a know-it-all judgemental person.","Sep 23, 2014"
9271767,Kathryn,"I read Snow very, very slowly--I took more than a month to read it-- and that rate felt appropriate. It wasn't gripping; it wasn't exciting. It was so beautiful, however, and sad, so very sad. I wept so many times while reading it, and always publicly. The political parts are interesting, and I felt like the discussions among community members about what it means to be Western and how they felt themselves observed (or not) by the West seemed so intelligent and unnervingly and bluntly insightful. This was not what made it a great book, though. For me, it was great because of the tremendous and yet understated portrait it provided of love, profound loneliness, loss, and disappointment. None of it was on a large scale-- there was no passion or intense, colorful scenes. Instead, it was small but incredibly deep and raw. You penetrate so deeply into one man's heart during a period when all of his chances for happiness and love hinge on one person. He knows, though, that his brief episode of happiness will not last, that it cannot last, and you know this, too. Devastation is inevitable and so painful to witness. And yet, you feel such compassion (co-suffering) for him, Ka, and for everyone who loves despite the incredible pain involved (all of us, I think). And that experience of compassion, for Ka, for oneself, and for everyone else, I don't know, somehow reminds you of fundamental truths about human nature and what being human is all about. Beauty and suffering, the heights and the depths. I loved this book.","Dec 02, 2012"
32635507,Rex,"I've been to Kars only for a short time, and in late spring, when yellow flowers are everywhere, so it is difficult for me to relate the winter atmosphere of this novel to the quiet but lovely part of eastern Turkey I encountered in person. Nevertheless, I think I will enjoy. Snow. more on every reread. It is absorbing and introspective, sentimental and political, vivid in its presentation of people thrown into the mad (and sometimes literal) theater of a local coup. For Pamuk, Kars, with its poverty and isolation, its provincial jealousies, its resentment at being alternately ignored and pitied by the world, is transfigured by the falling snow into a magical city where love and religion alike are quickly gained and quickly lost, where dreams of romantic or political glory are seemingly allowed to blossom before being exposed as ephemera under the cruel light of the sun. Those who die linger as ghosts of desire in the souls of those who were close to them. Pamuk's neurotic protagonist conscientiously entertains both the beckoning visions of the snow and a clinging drive toward self-destruction; the novel, likewise, teeters between hope and fatalism. Can a life have meaning, or are we stuck in the ""Place Where God Does Not Exist,"" as a young Islamist puts it, hungry wights longing vainly for happiness? Perhaps, paradoxically, the sorrow and alienation and disappointment that come as the snow melts, when we realize we are actors in a play not of our choosing, might enable us to find and truly live in one another.","Apr 03, 2015"
137418,William,"There is no real reason to link Snow to. The Lovers of Algeria. or. The Swallows of Kabul. , two Muslim-authored books I read earlier this year, other than a personal effort to understand better the religion our President seems to be at war against. But of these three novels, which all deal with the leaps in power given to Islamic fundamentalists over the past thirty years, Snow seems the most Western-feeling of the three. Maybe that’s a given for a novel about Turkey, the most Westernized of Mediterranean Muslim nations, and for a book whose author was awarded a prize from that most prestigious Western literary institution.. What I. liked. about Snow was its Western feel, which seemed to allow me in a bit more (an attitude with political problems). The scope, too, is broad and detailed and full of interesting characters who are all perfectly understandable as individuals.. When you read a book that is so obviously good, it seems silly to go on about it so much. So I’ll just say (until perhaps I can think of something more original to add) that I enjoyed getting into this author’s world, and will probably read more of it soon.","Jun 21, 2007"
34121152,Soren,"The first 150 pages or so of this book are really moving and beautifully written. I felt sucked into a mystical slipstream of natural beauty, somber contemplation, and the sense that life's direction, while baffling, is somehow driven. The rest of the book is less powerful and more chaotic, yet at the end I was left with the sense of having experienced something profound. Also, Fazil's meta-statement to the book's audience on the last page is a powerful warning about how we may have been misreading the book.. It was Margaret Atwood's review (Headscarves to Die For) that pushed me over the edge of indecision to finally read this book, and I set out hoping to gain some insight into the conflict between conservative Islamism and Western values. To any who read with similar motivation, I say: if you want analysis and talking points, go read an essay or a history book; however, if you want to be left with a profound FEELING of the tension, this book is exactly what you should read.. If you expect a linear plot with a clear, neat message, you will be disappointed. But if you are ready for a winding journey that is both beautiful and frustrating, this book is definitely worth reading.","Feb 10, 2016"
18170516,Parth Seth,"""People who seek only happiness never find it."". This book served as my introduction to the world of Orhan Pamuk. I was going through a reading slump of late due to reasons I deem best not to share on this platform. This wonderful book by Orhan Pamuk, translated by Maureen Freely, helped me come out of it.. The book opens with the bus journey of the main protagonist called Ka from Erzurum to Kars(though his real name was Kerim Alakuşoğlu). Being a political exile in Frankfurt, he had returned to his country, ostensibly, for his mother's funeral, and to cover the municipal elections of the city of Kars which had been caught in a suicide epidemic raging among its young women. However, his intention was to reconnect with the beautiful İpek Hanım, a lady divorced to his college-mate Muhtar who was poised for a victory in the elections. The plot then turns to a coup de'etat in the garb of a coup de theatre by a visiting theatre group. The entire novel spans three days of the coup, and how Ka became embroiled in the insanity of boundless love, intrigue, politics, religion, and deceit.. The author lays bare the dichotomy between the East and the West which plays out in the minds of common people and their perceptions. I think the novel is a study in perceptions of the 'technological' West and the 'mystical' East—the latter taking steps towards donning a fabric woven by the West. These perceptions breed hatred and misunderstanding, the effects of which can be seen today in the didactic lectures given by leaders on the shortcomings of Western culture, and of the stagnancy of the East. This theme is profound in virtually all of Pamuk's works, and has allowed him to carve a distinct space for himself in Postmodern literature.. The novel elucidates the omnipresent identity struggle in Ka's mind. On one hand, he is closely tied to his leftist, revolutionary ideals of liberty and individualism. On the other hand, he is disillusioned with his ideals because they have reaped him nothing. He is far removed from the grassroots of his country and terribly fails to understand their conflicts. His life in Frankfurt is underscored by melancholy, a longing for İpek, poet's block, loneliness, and grief. The atmosphere of Kars, the honesty of its natives like Necip, and closeness with İpek sends him to summits of happiness. He accomplishes to write an entire volume of poetry and rekindles something called hope: a hope for a happy life with İpek in Frankfurt.. Even though the novel was penned in 2004, its theme revolving around religion is as pertinent in contemporary Turkey and the Orient. The author cleverly juxtaposes the everyday struggles of the simpletons, their abject poverty, and hopelessness, with their constant struggle against the imposition of godlessness and atheism. Having read Orhan's personal opinion on religion and religious politics, I can safely say that he doesn't let them come in between the narrative; he gives as much space to the Kemalists and leftists like Turgut Bey, as he does to the Islamists like Blue and the high school boys. The author, however, passionately highlights that contrary to the opinion of the intolerant atheists, religion is not a reserve of the poor to aid them to escape the bitter realities of their life. Instead, it is followed with equal enthusiasm and held close to the soul by the educated and forward-looking sections of the society as well. By showcasing the conflict between the Islamists and the Kemalists, the author gives abundant food for thought to the readers so that they form an independent opinion on this stand.. I could identify with the philosophical discourse on happiness that underscored Ka's visit to Turkey. He'd, after all, gone there to find the happiness he may never have known but had always desired. Ka is painted as an individual who is simultaneously desirous of, and insular to, happiness. Even when happiness knocks at his doors, he hunts for some excuse to turn it away, lest its end bring about greater sadness than what prevailed in the present. Huzun, that is, melancholy is a dominant theme of Orhan Pamuk's novels. It is this melancholy which reprises at different junctures of the story. Ka's destiny conspires to keep him in the throngs of melancholy. He is showcased to be lonely and depressed to such an extent that unhappiness imparted a strange sort of relaxation to him. Ka's happiness led him to be a believer, and also helped him to come out of his poet's block. For the author, happiness lay in objects external to Ka– be it the obsession with İpek or the bonding with Necip. Probably it was his inability to find happiness within that made Ka hopelessly and resolutely sad.. In the concluding chapters of the novel, the narrator also brings to the fore his friendship with Ka. His friendship made him hunt for his friend's lost notebook of poems and takes him all the way to Kars. In Kars, he himself can't help feeling helplessly attracted to İpek. I think at this point the narrative became a bit unstructured. Suddenly, his brotherly sensitivity to Ka assumed the form of jealousy. He leaves the readers confused over his own feelings towards Ka. Was he a jealous friend in love with İpek, or a realistic man who saw the error of his friend's ways and could find no reason to showcase his innocence? The author could not logically explain how the issue of the headscarf girls– which was the underlying theme of the story– gets overpowered by Ka's obsession with making ploys for a happy life with İpek and convincing her, only to surface at the end of the story.. All things considered, the book was an amazing page-turner. Its philosophical concerns were highly relatable. Touching on a variety of themes in politics, religion, culture, love, and friendship(of which I have touched upon a few), it promises to be on the bookshelves of a diverse set of people. The author effortlessly builds unforgettable and deep characters. I highly recommend this novel, and hope that it goes on to become a classic in postmodern literature.","Dec 12, 2019"
421720,Laura J. W.,"A fascinating and lovely book, a bit prophetic.... I love mental traveling in books, visiting places I may never see in my lifetime and finding surprises there...snow being one of them, I could smell it.... ""The sight of snow made her think how beautiful and short life is and how, in spite of all their enmities, people have so very much in common; measured against eternity and the greatness of creation, the world in which they lived was narrow. That's why snow drew people together. It was as if snow cast a veil over hatreds, greed, and wrath and made everyone feel close to one another."" From page 119. I might complain about our snow here in Upstate New York (when we get it, it's late this year, but I know it will come, El Nino or not...), but there is a special excitement about its arrival, and the storms are fine to watch from a window when we're all safe and warm inside...","Nov 27, 2009"
65809,Janet,"I love the premise of this book, both that he is addressing the power of poetry, and looking into the motivation behind young women deciding to cover their heads. I wasn't disappointed in how he dealt with poetry, but I wasn't satisfied with his answer about the choices the young women made. This may partly be because he didn't really find an answer, but was just bringing up the question. I did admire that his book refuses to give us answers we can trust, but asks some very pertinent questions. What does it mean when the people we look up to have secrets that would make us respect them less? Is their message any less strong? The deepest themes I got from the novel were that we are all human and love is the main thing we all care about. The best parts of the book were the messages given to the west through his characters, especially the young men.","Sep 15, 2010"
2993355,Amerynth,"Very disappointed by Orhan Pamuk's ""Snow,"" which I really thought would be right up my alley from reading the description-- its focus on Turkey, the suicides of young girls and religious freedom really sounded promising. I'm still at a loss how it went so awry.. It was an incredibly slow read. I don't know if it was the translation or the original material, but I just found the writing incredibly dull. The best description for it would be clunky, as another reader said below. I couldn't find myself investing in any of the characters at all and often put the book down after a reading just a few pages. It also felt really repetitive... the same things circle round and round, but never really seem to lead anywhere but back upon themselves. Overall, the book really never captured my interest.... reading it felt like work.","Jul 26, 2012"
51519487,Patrick Robitaille,"*** 1/2. An exiled Turkish poet returns to an isolated part of the motherland under the pretext of writing an article about a wave of suicide among local Islamist girls. In fact, he returned there with the aim of rekindling an old flame, but ends up with his life turned upside down due to a snow storm and a fake revolution started by a theater troupe and a corrupt army officer. An interesting, eye-opening novel about the frictions created between secularism and fundamentalism in Islam. Quite poetic in parts, quite slow in others, quite often intriguing because of the narrative techniques used, blurring to some extent the line between fiction and reality, both within the plot and the novel itself. And it's a pity that the green notebook has been lost forever, as I was curious to read the 19 poems that came to Ka while he was in Kars.","Jan 14, 2016"
832008,Kana,"This book was almost added to the list of few books I never finished. I eneded up skimming through the last few chapters just to be done with it. This was basically because the author created characters with whom you never become engaged. The book's tone was so melancholy that it slowed the pace to a crawl. It leaves the reader feeling as if they are just following the main character, Ka, as he wanders aimlessly through the small town of Kars. Actually, aimless is a good way of summing up this book. The author kills any suspense that he has managed to build up by revealing what is going to happen before it happens. And if I had to read ""the falling snow made the streets so silent"" one more time, I was going to poke my eyes out.","Jan 25, 2008"
7742,Jennifer Chin,"Stories within stories, a narrator and characters who are at times completely honest and other times completely untrustworthy. As I read, I felt the only thing I could trust was the feelings of the moment, the deep flaws in each character unveiled at first with great nuance, and then shoved blatantly into my mind. The metaphor of snow is more than that; it comes to represent the one consistency through the novel, the ever-present flakes adding layer upon layer of meaning to the most simple moments. At times it reminded me of Nabokov's Pale Fire, where through the voice of an ever-shifting narrator, you cannot tell whose tale is whose. And after all, isn't that life - there is no one truth, only the stories we piece together from what we tell one another?","Apr 24, 2010"

3058645,Seleucid,"I understand that maybe Pamuk's point was to show the childish shallowness of the Turkish elite, their inability to survive in real Turkish society, or any other one for that matter, but Ka's character is too obnoxious and self-centered to bear. Every time he gets into one of his inner thoughts you disconnect yourself from the book in disgust.. The police are as childish as the protesters, the islamists, the marxists, the coup plotters. A whole book of delusional people you're supposed to sympathize with, you're supposed to understand, but the utter pointlessness of it forces you to stop. Maybe that was what Pamuk wanted.. The lead female characters were amazing people however, affirming my notion that in the Middle East, the woman is the one keeping it all sane. Bless them.","Jan 15, 2011"
1049533,Amy,"I just didn't buy into this one. One of the reviews in the front compared this to a Dostoevky novel. Snow is trying to raise social and philosophical issues but the difference is that Dostoevsky makes it a natural part of his story where this one's efforts seemed forced. And please don't tell me we were supposed to believe that there was an actual love story going on in there because not a single one of them elicited any emotion from me. And all the inspiration for Ka's poetry? I'm just not sure I saw it. With what Pamuk was trying to do, I should have the feeling of being engrossed in a story, moving along with where its trying to take me but instead I'm left feeling like I was just reading words on a page.","Jun 13, 2011"
6527309,John Carpenter,"I read Snow about five years ago after hearing Orhan Pamuk speak at Washington University in St. Louis. I loved the story, but as with most of Pamuk's works--at least, the three or four I've read, the prose is so very dense in places that it took me a long time to finish. That said, the journey was worth it, and having lived a year in Turkey made the story more ""see-able."" I also like Pamuk's penchant for symbolism--naming the main character Snow in an off-handed kind of way and having him fall in love with a woman called Silk. All of that set, of course, among murder and mysticism. And blood. The novel reminds me that it's a complex world, both internally and externally, and that relatively speaking, I have it pretty easy by comparison, when it comes to religion, politics, safety.","Nov 22, 2011"

Some of the scenes seemed crazy set ups, but the author in an afterword in another edition stated that most of what happened in the book, happened to him. At the book club meeting,it provoked an excellent discussion of Islam and to a lesser degree, most religions. How ""religious"" does someone have to be? Can you not follow all parts of a belief system yet consider yourself a member of a religion? We had no firm answers, but a lot of thoughtful comments.","Jul 03, 2012"

Kay is a poet coming back to the city if Kars to reclaim a former love. He is also going to report on the suicides of young girls who have been forbidden to wear head scarves. The writing felt extra tenuous to me and I was bogged down by all the detail of poverty, meetings with terrorists and police brutality and interference with common people who had no evil motives, just to make it through the next day..

1882126,Nancy,"What a complicated read. Definitely not for everyone. I would perhaps have enjoyed it more had I a better understanding of Turkish politics and history. More interesting to me was Pamuk's 2005 court case in Turkey in which he was charged with making statements that were insulting to the Republic or Turkish Natl Assembly. The charges were dropped on a technicality. However, he was eventually found guilty following an appeal to the Supreme Court. His novel touches on the profound confusion of fundamentalist versus the invasion of Western secularism. I'm sure as a 'westerner' I fail to fully comprehend the complex motivations behind the Middle Eastern people's religious and political choices. This book goes a long way in exposing the elaborate influences.","Oct 30, 2012"
23818026,Kshitiz Goliya,"Everything has politics, my professor once told me. While reading Snow, I realized the true value of that statement.. Turkey has always been torn between Islamists and military backed secularists. The recent coup attempt was in line with many that preceded it.. Whenever an Islamist party becomes powerful and thus tries to project Islam more forcefully, there is a section that lashes back, albeit through non-democratic means.. The tolerance for coups in some parts of Turkish society has made sure that they are still an option resorted to by military, whenever it feels the government of the day is diverging from the unwritten principles of Ataturk.. Snow is the story of a poet, Ka, who returns to Turkey from his exile in Germany and goes to a small town, Kars. Behind his trip was hidden the desire to see a woman named Ipek whom he secretly loved during his student days and who later married and subsequently divorced his other friend.. He masquerades as a journalist on assignment and enters Kars amidst a snowy winter at its full might. His supposed focus of inquiry is the suicide girls. These girls, for reasons that Ka tried finding but could never be clear, gave up their lives in quick successions. The act alarmed the society and brought the focus of elite press from the capital.. With suicide being a crime in Islam, were these women, who were generally suppressed in Islam, using suicide as an act of defiance? Or was it out of pure desperation and despair?. It didn't matter after some time as Ka started to get pulled into the town's life and contradictions.. Soon he met the women he had deeply and secretly loved, which combined with conflict in the city, brought within him a swell of thoughts that opened the way for some of his best poems.. Islam and atheism, communist and Islamist, love and betrayal; he had to deal with all these extremes during his stay in Kars and still he was happiest for Ipek requited his love.. At the same time, he saw an old man being shot closely followed by a successful local coup attempt, each event pulling him deeper into the whirlwind of city's politics and the associated conspiracies.. Ka, like every human, cherished the secret longings of happiness and imagined it to be in a married life with Ipek. He saw it in both of them walking down the streets of Berlin, away from the tumult of Turkey.. Ka constantly took refuge in the beauty of snow, in its constant and gradual descent as well as pure whiteness.. However, at the back of his mind was always a fear that happiness will slip out of his fingers and melt like the constantly falling snow flakes in the streets of Kars.. He soon realized that happiness is like a snow flake, beautiful and pure, but equally fragile, ready to disappear as soon as it is within grasp.. The secret police within the city, on the lines of Stasi and KGB, closely followed Ka with its spies and bugs all over the town. He ends up running against them, out of his love for Ipek and encounters certain truths that shatter his dream of a happy married life in Berlin.. Ultimately, as the winter recedes and snow melts, so does his dreams of happiness. He leaves Kars alone in the train, Ipek left behind. Happiness for him was short lived.","Oct 12, 2016"

140203,Brian,"Poetically political, this novel focuses on the rather current debate in modern Turkey over whether to be more Western or to be more Eastern. Choosing the former means progress, democracy, ""freedom"", etc., but at the potential loss of a national identity rooted in cultural/religious ties to the Islamic world. The stage for the debate is the remote city of Kars, which is about to be isolated from the rest of the country by an oncoming snowstorm. Enter the poet Ka, who comes to Kars ostensibly to investigate the phenomenon of Islamic university women committing suicide for having to remove their headscarves in order to attend the univesities, but whose reasons for staying quickly turn purely romantic and nostalgic. Indeed, snow to him has a powerfully romantic and nostalgic effect, while for everyone else it is simply a nuisance; for, when a coup suddenly takes place during a play at a theater (art and politics blend continually throughout the novel), the city is unable to receive any help from the national government due to the heavy snowfall.. While snow has significant poetical meaning for Ka, which the narrator explains in detail in several chapters, it really functions in the book as a metaphor of fate. For snow can fall gently and beautifully, and be wonderful to watch or dance or play in, or it can fall forcibly, and quite limit one's scope of activity. The more political the characters are, the less they appreciate the snow; these characters seek to control the course of events, and the snowfall prevents them from doing so. The less political (and really this only means Ka plus a few others to a certain extent), the more snow is just a part of life; something that can be looked at beautifully if one is not seeking to control the natural course of events for one's own purposes.. Thus does the story seem to suggest (albeit very slightly, kind of like the falling of snow) that, to some extent or another, the course of historical events is really outside of any one individual or one group's control; there is always something more powerful at work. These individuals and groups certainly play a role (as in a play--solutions to political problems are sought out twice in the form of a play in this novel) in the shaping of that history, but it is not really they who shape history; history shapes them.. Will Turkey become more Eastern or Western? That question almost seems pushed aside by the larger question of how the answering of that question will affect the players involved. Will they be like the young, politically-charged characters, whose lives end abruptly either by their own hand or by someone else's? Or will they be like Ka, who pursues a more personal beauty in life, who stands by and watches the natural course of change in his country, seeking to capture it in verse, who only becomes incidentally involved in the political events by his pursuit of love (of which he is bereft by those same political events).. This is truly a complicated novel, and yet its themes and ideas are tied together so intricately and delicately; rather like a snowflake.","Jun 01, 2008"

Political Islam is their proxy for inferiority and other complex emotions about ""The West"". (One young man dreams of eating well on the lap of a blonde western woman). The headscarf is a symbol of solidarity... and a powerful symbol it is in Kars. The town is gripped by the tension and drama surrounding a prominent woman's potential removal of her scarf (will she or won't she?) and to a lesser degree by the question of who killed the administrator of the local university tasked by ""Istambul"" with enforcing the ban on headscarves.. Ka says he is investigating the suicides of the ""headscarf girls"", who are the real victims of this political culture, for a story in a German periodical. While Islamists ponitificate on the pitiable piety of the suicide girls, Ka finds other motives. These motives show a paternal willingness to marry off, abuse or otherwise sacrifice their daughters that reflects the same attitude that pressures them to wear the scarves. The sad situation of the girls, caught between their desire for an education, their need to belong and their families' desire to control them is never expressed by the girls (except by their suicides)... only by those who presume to speak for them.. In ""Red"" the characters introduce themselves through their first person chapters. Here, in a similar technique characters disclose themselves through first person dialog in which they reveal their personal conflicts, ambivalences and often a sense of defeatism.. The book is written in a different first person, but there is only a hint of this in the beginning. I'm glad Pamuk resisted the temptation to give us intricate folk tales nested inside the stories as he did in ""Red"".. This is a beautifully crafted portrait. While it defines a specific culture in rural Turkey, there is a wider metaphor for social groups left behind.I hope this book finds its way to academic reading lists. It deserves a wide and thoughtful audience.. It's like ""Red"", is a warm up for ""Snow"". I hope ""Snow"" is another warm up for more and equally powerful literature by Pamuk.","Dec 28, 2014"
40489794,Jo-Lynne Lockley,"Nobel Prize winner Orham Pamuk describes the complexities of European / Islamic relations and perceptions through the character of once exiled middling journalist and poet Ka who finds himself snowed-in in the once grand and now deteriorating Turkish city of Kars. Ka, who has been sent there by a Turkish paper published in Germany to cover suicides apparently connected to a debate over banning head scarves and who carries memories of a woman from the days of his rational youthful political involvement, finds himself caught in an inescapable crucible where Eastern fundamentalist misperceptions and misguided and ham handed government attempts to hold a backwater to the urban secular state colide in a bizarre conflagration of art or at least the artistic ego pretending to art meets politics and military force. The resulting total collapse of rational and civil society in a farsical political military artistic microcosm brings out the worst in Ka, whose whose hitherto writers block constipated poetry begins to flow with neither restraint nor reflection due, as he feels, alternately to the snow or the beautiful Ipek as muse. As Ka's artistic delusions and infatuation with Ipek increase his moral compass fails, so that his self interested actions lead to the loss of his dreams and not a few deaths. A thread of Ka's inner conflict between the rational secularism he has embraced all his life, the enthrallment with Islam thread through the entertainly absurd tale without informing his actions or decisions.. The characters with whom Pamuk populates the story are magnificent cartoons of the worlds of political military intrigue and pseudo art, which acts as a justification for the barbary into which Ka allows himself to be drawn.. The language is straight forward and hardly lyrical. It's in translation, after all. I find it hard to see the book as a satire, although it paints a persiflage of political / religious fanatics, madmen and expedient remoras. It is funny. Or at least amusing. Only after putting the book down and letting the managerie and chaos settle does one sense that the situation Pamuk creates is hysterical, but hardly to laugh at.. Pamuk foreshadows the turning points and end of the novel well before he relates actual events, making it less of a page turner (it still is...knowing what happened one is eager to see how it happened).. For me it had the feel of the illegitimate child of Death in Venice and Wag the Dog..not a bad thing, all in all.","Dec 10, 2015"

The pursuit of happiness always just out of reach and ultimately never realized..... ""People don't know when they're happy, at least not at the moment. I decided years later that I'd been happy as a child, but the truth is, I wasn't. On the other hand, I was not unhappy in the way I was during the years that followed. I just wasn't interested in happiness at first."" 285. ""All over the world - even in America - the newspapers tailor the news to their readers' desires.

2609937,Lynne Norman,"I honestly don't know where to start with my review of this novel. I suppose I can begin by saying that I didn't like it - despite the fact I really, really wanted to. The only problem is I find it hard to put my finger on why I didn't like it - as I generally relish reading post-modern writing, such as this, where it is less about the novel's narrative arc than it is about the many layers and themes. It frustrates me that I didn't like this book - because I then feel as though I must have missed something, and I don't like the feeling that maybe I just didn't 'get' it.. Perhaps it was the protagonist himself - Ka - that turned me off? He is a very immature and selfish individual, with borderline sociopathic tendencies. I believe the reader was supposed to see him as a naive and pure artist, perhaps, but instead I found him cold and one dimensional. Maybe it was the cast list as a whole that I found problematical - consisting, as it did, of many one-dimensional people, who never seemed to react to events or conversations in the way that normal, and therefore complex, human beings would (Maybe that was the point? Who knows? Not me). It could have been the representation of women as there wasn't one strong female character I could identify with - again, as this is a book narrated from a male perspective, this could have been a commentary on how Turkish women are viewed by the men around them - but it's not a clearly made comment if that's the case.. On the positive side, Pamuk's prose is on occasion beautiful and he does a very good job of conjuring up a sense of place and atmosphere. It's enough to make me a little sad that not one of the poems written by Ka through this tale makes an appearance in the book. That said, I do understand that, again, that's kind of the point - the poems represent the key to understanding another human being's psyche (in this instance, the narrator Orhan Pamuk's understanding of his lost friend Ka) and the failure to unearth these poems speaks to the fact we can never truly understand the people we are close to (or at least I think that's what it represents!).. I think it speaks volumes that the reviews for this book tend to swing widely from love to hate. Unfortunately, I definitely tend towards the latter.","Oct 09, 2010"
4007077,Sarahlynn,"My apologies for the erratic weather we've had so far this year. I recently realized that it's all my fault.. See, in December a friend gave me a novel called Snow by Turkish author Orhan Pamuk. As I read it in fits and starts, it took me a really really long time to finish. But I'm finally done! And so now the snow can stop and spring can commence in earnest.. You're welcome.. As for why it took me so long to finish this book, well, that's all me I suppose. I kept flipping back to the front cover to verify that the seal on the front proclaiming, ""Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature!"" was still there and not just something I dreamed.. Later, I'd turn the book over and peruse the blurbs again. ""One of the best books of the year"" according to just about everyone from The New York Times Book Review to The Economist. Rave reviews from truly impressive people.. Repeatedly I read the jacket copy. ""Slyly comic."" Also, ""humor,"" ""wicked grin,"" etc.. I was excited to read this fabulous book, which came so highly recommended and is set in Turkey. (My in-laws lived in Turkey for years and my husband was actually born there; they returned to the states when his sister was ready for elementary school.). But I just didn't get it. I didn't engage with the story, I didn't connect with the characters, and I felt frustrated by the pace. (The first day seemed to me like it must have been at least 48 hours long. Is Ka really in his late 30's as it appears? If so, how come the 17+ year age difference between close sisters Ipek and Kadife is never discussed?) I utterly missed the humor.. Obviously, this is all on me since apparently everyone else who's read Snow loved it. But I spent the first 200 pages trying to figure out why the author gave most of the unrelated main characters the same last name (Bey). Then I figured it must be a subtle comment on the provincial nature of Turkish society (the cerebral humor I'd been missing?). By page 300 I'd realized that ""Bey"" must be a sort of honorific (and it is). Some of my confusion might indeed have been cultural. I certainly feel like an uncultured ignoramus for my utter failure to appreciate this highly acclaimed novel.. But I finished it, and now it's spring!","May 06, 2011"
17248131,Michael Battaglia,"In keeping with the ""themes without really trying"" theme, I apparently to arrange to read three books about a fictional present day version of the Ottoman Empire and then right afterwards read a book about what the Ottoman Empire later evolved into today. That . . . wasn't intentional.. But while Grimwood's trilogy was set in a present day version of Alexandria, Egypt, Pamuk's book is set in Turkey itself. Weirdly, both involve investigating deaths but while one is attempting to do a SF noir, Pamuk is going for something a bit more in depth, even if his also features two people who should be together but refuse to be for a variety of excuses.. For those who have never encountered him, Pamuk is a Turkish novelist and probably the best known Turkish writer outside of Turkey, having won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006. Having made a name for himself internationally with ""My Name is Red"", this was the follow up novel (and I think his second published in English) and both on some level deal with tensions between the East and West, here highlighted by the poet Ka, who is an expat living in Frankfurt, Germany for years and who travels to the Turkish border city of Kars in a journalistic capacity to investigate a spate of suicides of young girls. The word is they killed themselves rather than be forced to remove their headscarves, something that might strike a person as a somewhat frivilous reason to kill yourself. But spend a little time in the ""Context is Everything"" department and you get an idea how meaningful the issue is to people. At the time of Turkey's founding it was considered a secular state and thus the wearing of headscarves was discouraged, later on becoming outright banned in public places after around 1980. For a country with a devout Muslim population this didn't always sit well and in the case of the students in the novel it was banned at all schools and unversities, leading to the protests discussed before the action in the novel starts. Its a debate that still goes on today, as Turkey's current prime minister campaigned on it although Turkey's high court seems to have put the kibosh on any attempts to lift it as recently as 2008.. Needless to say, its not a trifling issue to the people in the novel and as Ka enters the city just as its cut off by a massive snowstorm, you figure either one of two things will happen . . . Lovecraftian monsters will emerge from the blizzard or a whole lot of life-altering drama is about to happen. As it turns out, Ka probably should have wished for Cthulu.. His initial reason for going as a journalist falls apart pretty quickly as his early rounds of questioning don't get him much of anywhere but fortunately his backup reason is fairly compelling as well . . . an opportunity to start fresh with a woman he used to be in love with, now recently divorced. Trapped in the city adn staying at her father's hotel, all Ka can hear is Bad Company's greatest hit playing on constant repeat in his head, alternating with a rush of poems that have to do with being trapped in a city where no one seems to like him or each other, and often express that through long debates or by firing guns. Sometimes, for variety, its both.. Its a very dreamlike novel at times, trapped in a strange kind of stasis as everyone runs around making their arguments while the snow constantly falls and political conditions take a strong swing toward ""armed insurrection"". Having been away for a while and living in Germany Ka is seen as a Westerner, something that everyone loves reminding him about as often as they can and highlighting probably Ka's biggest stumbling block (and maybe ours) in trying to salvage anything he can out of this situation . . . he just doesn't understand these people.. Its that lack of understanding that underlies almost every bad decision he makes, intentionally or otherwise. Faced with a variety of nationalist, Islamic and secular factions, all of whom have pretty strong ideas on how things should be done, Ka tries to thread a needle with the kind of rope that docks a ship and gets the kinds of results you'd expect. It doesn't help that almost everyone is okay with a body count . . . an early murder happens quickly before Pamuk takes us back to the excruciating discussion beforehand, all the time the outcome hanging about in the back of our heads. A later massacre is horrifying in how it feels like a dream and how pointless it seems, with soldiers firing on a crowd and us being warned who will die before the bullets hit. As it goes on, everyone is sure they're right but it seems the ones willing to go the furthest will be the ones to carry the day, at least until the snow clears and the local authorities restore order.. Its a postmodern novel, which means it can be a bit emotionally chilly at times . . . Ka and Ipek's rekindling of their relationship can be touching but there's always a bit of distance in everyone's feelings, like the cold from the snow has made everyone a little bit numb. Ka as a main character isn't the most dynamic force, once the suicide investigation falls off the map so does almost all his momentum for driving the plot and from then he's carried by events when he's not wooing Ipek to the point where you almost want to ask the guy to get a room inside his room. Also, just for giggles, Pamuk places himself as the narrator doing his own investigation of Ka's life before and after the events in Kars, which means sometimes the narrative stops or changes shape as we're given access to events that Ka doens't know about yet or details about what later happens to him and the other characters.. It makes for a novel that probably has the same snowflake structure of Ka's lost book of poems, one where all the delicate places are connected but only last as long as the storm holds out. People hoping to see a ride through the underbelly of a town's political and religious frictions may be a little disappointed how much of the back portions of the book are given to preparation for a provocative play but its what happens around those preparations that makes the novel finally frost over. We're never given the resolution to some of the mysteries in the story but that only seems fitting. What the novel seems to be best trying to figure out is how to understand each other, how our points of view can coexist even when those points don't seem to include other people, how a simple piece of clothing or its removal can mean the world to someone. Ka goes home to a foreign country, from a place that everyone treats like another planet and in the end the only way to understand is by imposing your own filters to make the differences digestible, which isn't really understanding at all. And maybe the ones who really get it are those able to articulate that disconnect but unfortunately no one probably understands them either.","Jul 28, 2018"
310423,penelopewanders,"The best part about reading this book is that practically the whole time I was reading it, it was snowing like crazy here in the mountains. So every now and then I could gaze out the window just like Ka.. Other than that I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. I had first heard of this author when I was remotely involved with a European Young Readers' Award ceremony - My Name is Red was one of the six books shortlisted for the prize. I had ordered all six, but Pamuk's book did not arrive before the meeting so I didn't get to read it ahead of time. Later I tried to send it down to our country place to read at some point on holiday, but it was stolen out of our car (with about twenty-five other TBRs!!) while the car was parked waiting for the ferry. So I haven't read that one which I was very intrigued by. When I saw this offered as a bookcrossing ring, I signed up right away.. At times I very much enjoyed this, but after a while felt like I was looking into a mirror across from a mirror and the multiple reflections were dizzying in the long run. There was a certain amount of poetry, but when I tried to discern a piece of writing I found really moving or beautiful, I could never quite put my finger on anything - like trying to hold onto a snowflake - at the end my fingers were just wet, but there was nothing I could really say, ""yes, this I really like."" I could not identify with the characters, neither male nor female - the constant pessimism of the hero was wearying,the women seemed calculating and one dimensional. Knowing ahead of time so much of what would happen was an interesting approach, but it added to the mirror within mirror effect.. Looking out at the snow falling as I write this, I can say I did enjoy the descriptions of the snow and the feeling of isolation. I was glad of the opportunity to read this.","Jan 18, 2012"
4308977,Vera Sophia,"As a woman who is also a muslim I am deeply drawn to the theme of this novel. The conflict between East v.s West, the struggle of identity, the unnecessary politicization of our religion and of course the obsession on what women should wear or not wear on their heads, are all too familiar. The issues of (muslim) women discussed in this book like the need to have a say on the control of our bodies, how we are turned into pawns in political game, really resonate with me. It is also fascinating to read about the characters which could easily be seen as one-dimensional in a more humanistic light, the handsome Islamist Blue who I can't really decide to hate nor like, Kadife who wears veil as an act of rebellion, or Necip the religious student who is bordering on atheism. Like all Pamuk's books, Snow posseses a distinct melancholic feeling which I love. With a sprinkle of (tragic) romance it is almost a perfect book for me.. I would end this review with a passage from the end of the book:. 'If you write a book set in Kars and put me in it, I'd like to tell your readers not to believe anything you say about me, anything you say about any of us. No one could understand us from so far away'. ...'If only to see themselves as wise and superior and humanistic, they need to think of us as sweet and funny, and convince themselves that they sympathise with the way we are and even love us. But if you would put in what I've just said, at least your readers will keep a little room for doubt in their minds.'. Thank you for another beautiful ending Mr. Pamuk, also for reminding me not to be a know-it-all judgemental person.","Sep 23, 2014"
9271767,Kathryn,"I read Snow very, very slowly--I took more than a month to read it-- and that rate felt appropriate. It wasn't gripping; it wasn't exciting. It was so beautiful, however, and sad, so very sad. I wept so many times while reading it, and always publicly. The political parts are interesting, and I felt like the discussions among community members about what it means to be Western and how they felt themselves observed (or not) by the West seemed so intelligent and unnervingly and bluntly insightful. This was not what made it a great book, though. For me, it was great because of the tremendous and yet understated portrait it provided of love, profound loneliness, loss, and disappointment. None of it was on a large scale-- there was no passion or intense, colorful scenes. Instead, it was small but incredibly deep and raw. You penetrate so deeply into one man's heart during a period when all of his chances for happiness and love hinge on one person. He knows, though, that his brief episode of happiness will not last, that it cannot last, and you know this, too. Devastation is inevitable and so painful to witness. And yet, you feel such compassion (co-suffering) for him, Ka, and for everyone who loves despite the incredible pain involved (all of us, I think). And that experience of compassion, for Ka, for oneself, and for everyone else, I don't know, somehow reminds you of fundamental truths about human nature and what being human is all about. Beauty and suffering, the heights and the depths. I loved this book.","Dec 02, 2012"
32635507,Rex,"I've been to Kars only for a short time, and in late spring, when yellow flowers are everywhere, so it is difficult for me to relate the winter atmosphere of this novel to the quiet but lovely part of eastern Turkey I encountered in person. Nevertheless, I think I will enjoy. Snow. more on every reread. It is absorbing and introspective, sentimental and political, vivid in its presentation of people thrown into the mad (and sometimes literal) theater of a local coup. For Pamuk, Kars, with its poverty and isolation, its provincial jealousies, its resentment at being alternately ignored and pitied by the world, is transfigured by the falling snow into a magical city where love and religion alike are quickly gained and quickly lost, where dreams of romantic or political glory are seemingly allowed to blossom before being exposed as ephemera under the cruel light of the sun. Those who die linger as ghosts of desire in the souls of those who were close to them. Pamuk's neurotic protagonist conscientiously entertains both the beckoning visions of the snow and a clinging drive toward self-destruction; the novel, likewise, teeters between hope and fatalism. Can a life have meaning, or are we stuck in the ""Place Where God Does Not Exist,"" as a young Islamist puts it, hungry wights longing vainly for happiness? Perhaps, paradoxically, the sorrow and alienation and disappointment that come as the snow melts, when we realize we are actors in a play not of our choosing, might enable us to find and truly live in one another.","Apr 03, 2015"
137418,William,"There is no real reason to link Snow to. The Lovers of Algeria. or. The Swallows of Kabul. , two Muslim-authored books I read earlier this year, other than a personal effort to understand better the religion our President seems to be at war against. But of these three novels, which all deal with the leaps in power given to Islamic fundamentalists over the past thirty years, Snow seems the most Western-feeling of the three. Maybe that’s a given for a novel about Turkey, the most Westernized of Mediterranean Muslim nations, and for a book whose author was awarded a prize from that most prestigious Western literary institution.. What I. liked. about Snow was its Western feel, which seemed to allow me in a bit more (an attitude with political problems). The scope, too, is broad and detailed and full of interesting characters who are all perfectly understandable as individuals.. When you read a book that is so obviously good, it seems silly to go on about it so much. So I’ll just say (until perhaps I can think of something more original to add) that I enjoyed getting into this author’s world, and will probably read more of it soon.","Jun 21, 2007"
34121152,Soren,"The first 150 pages or so of this book are really moving and beautifully written. I felt sucked into a mystical slipstream of natural beauty, somber contemplation, and the sense that life's direction, while baffling, is somehow driven. The rest of the book is less powerful and more chaotic, yet at the end I was left with the sense of having experienced something profound. Also, Fazil's meta-statement to the book's audience on the last page is a powerful warning about how we may have been misreading the book.. It was Margaret Atwood's review (Headscarves to Die For) that pushed me over the edge of indecision to finally read this book, and I set out hoping to gain some insight into the conflict between conservative Islamism and Western values. To any who read with similar motivation, I say: if you want analysis and talking points, go read an essay or a history book; however, if you want to be left with a profound FEELING of the tension, this book is exactly what you should read.. If you expect a linear plot with a clear, neat message, you will be disappointed. But if you are ready for a winding journey that is both beautiful and frustrating, this book is definitely worth reading.","Feb 10, 2016"
18170516,Parth Seth,"""People who seek only happiness never find it."". This book served as my introduction to the world of Orhan Pamuk. I was going through a reading slump of late due to reasons I deem best not to share on this platform. This wonderful book by Orhan Pamuk, translated by Maureen Freely, helped me come out of it.. The book opens with the bus journey of the main protagonist called Ka from Erzurum to Kars(though his real name was Kerim Alakuşoğlu). Being a political exile in Frankfurt, he had returned to his country, ostensibly, for his mother's funeral, and to cover the municipal elections of the city of Kars which had been caught in a suicide epidemic raging among its young women. However, his intention was to reconnect with the beautiful İpek Hanım, a lady divorced to his college-mate Muhtar who was poised for a victory in the elections. The plot then turns to a coup de'etat in the garb of a coup de theatre by a visiting theatre group. The entire novel spans three days of the coup, and how Ka became embroiled in the insanity of boundless love, intrigue, politics, religion, and deceit.. The author lays bare the dichotomy between the East and the West which plays out in the minds of common people and their perceptions. I think the novel is a study in perceptions of the 'technological' West and the 'mystical' East—the latter taking steps towards donning a fabric woven by the West. These perceptions breed hatred and misunderstanding, the effects of which can be seen today in the didactic lectures given by leaders on the shortcomings of Western culture, and of the stagnancy of the East. This theme is profound in virtually all of Pamuk's works, and has allowed him to carve a distinct space for himself in Postmodern literature.. The novel elucidates the omnipresent identity struggle in Ka's mind. On one hand, he is closely tied to his leftist, revolutionary ideals of liberty and individualism. On the other hand, he is disillusioned with his ideals because they have reaped him nothing. He is far removed from the grassroots of his country and terribly fails to understand their conflicts. His life in Frankfurt is underscored by melancholy, a longing for İpek, poet's block, loneliness, and grief. The atmosphere of Kars, the honesty of its natives like Necip, and closeness with İpek sends him to summits of happiness. He accomplishes to write an entire volume of poetry and rekindles something called hope: a hope for a happy life with İpek in Frankfurt.. Even though the novel was penned in 2004, its theme revolving around religion is as pertinent in contemporary Turkey and the Orient. The author cleverly juxtaposes the everyday struggles of the simpletons, their abject poverty, and hopelessness, with their constant struggle against the imposition of godlessness and atheism. Having read Orhan's personal opinion on religion and religious politics, I can safely say that he doesn't let them come in between the narrative; he gives as much space to the Kemalists and leftists like Turgut Bey, as he does to the Islamists like Blue and the high school boys. The author, however, passionately highlights that contrary to the opinion of the intolerant atheists, religion is not a reserve of the poor to aid them to escape the bitter realities of their life. Instead, it is followed with equal enthusiasm and held close to the soul by the educated and forward-looking sections of the society as well. By showcasing the conflict between the Islamists and the Kemalists, the author gives abundant food for thought to the readers so that they form an independent opinion on this stand.. I could identify with the philosophical discourse on happiness that underscored Ka's visit to Turkey. He'd, after all, gone there to find the happiness he may never have known but had always desired. Ka is painted as an individual who is simultaneously desirous of, and insular to, happiness. Even when happiness knocks at his doors, he hunts for some excuse to turn it away, lest its end bring about greater sadness than what prevailed in the present. Huzun, that is, melancholy is a dominant theme of Orhan Pamuk's novels. It is this melancholy which reprises at different junctures of the story. Ka's destiny conspires to keep him in the throngs of melancholy. He is showcased to be lonely and depressed to such an extent that unhappiness imparted a strange sort of relaxation to him. Ka's happiness led him to be a believer, and also helped him to come out of his poet's block. For the author, happiness lay in objects external to Ka– be it the obsession with İpek or the bonding with Necip. Probably it was his inability to find happiness within that made Ka hopelessly and resolutely sad.. In the concluding chapters of the novel, the narrator also brings to the fore his friendship with Ka. His friendship made him hunt for his friend's lost notebook of poems and takes him all the way to Kars. In Kars, he himself can't help feeling helplessly attracted to İpek. I think at this point the narrative became a bit unstructured. Suddenly, his brotherly sensitivity to Ka assumed the form of jealousy. He leaves the readers confused over his own feelings towards Ka. Was he a jealous friend in love with İpek, or a realistic man who saw the error of his friend's ways and could find no reason to showcase his innocence? The author could not logically explain how the issue of the headscarf girls– which was the underlying theme of the story– gets overpowered by Ka's obsession with making ploys for a happy life with İpek and convincing her, only to surface at the end of the story.. All things considered, the book was an amazing page-turner. Its philosophical concerns were highly relatable. Touching on a variety of themes in politics, religion, culture, love, and friendship(of which I have touched upon a few), it promises to be on the bookshelves of a diverse set of people. The author effortlessly builds unforgettable and deep characters. I highly recommend this novel, and hope that it goes on to become a classic in postmodern literature.","Dec 12, 2019"

I love mental traveling in books, visiting places I may never see in my lifetime and finding surprises there...snow being one of them, I could smell it.... ""The sight of snow made her think how beautiful and short life is and how, in spite of all their enmities, people have so very much in common; measured against eternity and the greatness of creation, the world in which they lived was narrow. That's why snow drew people together. It was as if snow cast a veil over hatreds, greed, and wrath and made everyone feel close to one another."" From page 119. I might complain about our snow here in Upstate New York (when we get it, it's late this year, but I know it will come, El Nino or not...), but there is a special excitement about its arrival, and the storms are fine to watch from a window when we're all safe and warm inside...","Nov 27, 2009"
65809,Janet,"I love the premise of this book, both that he is addressing the power of poetry, and looking into the motivation behind young women deciding to cover their heads. I wasn't disappointed in how he dealt with poetry, but I wasn't satisfied with his answer about the choices the young women made. This may partly be because he didn't really find an answer, but was just bringing up the question. I did admire that his book refuses to give us answers we can trust, but asks some very pertinent questions. What does it mean when the people we look up to have secrets that would make us respect them less? Is their message any less strong? The deepest themes I got from the novel were that we are all human and love is the main thing we all care about. The best parts of the book were the messages given to the west through his characters, especially the young men.","Sep 15, 2010"
2993355,Amerynth,"Very disappointed by Orhan Pamuk's ""Snow,"" which I really thought would be right up my alley from reading the description-- its focus on Turkey, the suicides of young girls and religious freedom really sounded promising. I'm still at a loss how it went so awry.. It was an incredibly slow read. I don't know if it was the translation or the original material, but I just found the writing incredibly dull. The best description for it would be clunky, as another reader said below. I couldn't find myself investing in any of the characters at all and often put the book down after a reading just a few pages. It also felt really repetitive... the same things circle round and round, but never really seem to lead anywhere but back upon themselves. Overall, the book really never captured my interest.... reading it felt like work.","Jul 26, 2012"
51519487,Patrick Robitaille,"*** 1/2. An exiled Turkish poet returns to an isolated part of the motherland under the pretext of writing an article about a wave of suicide among local Islamist girls. In fact, he returned there with the aim of rekindling an old flame, but ends up with his life turned upside down due to a snow storm and a fake revolution started by a theater troupe and a corrupt army officer. An interesting, eye-opening novel about the frictions created between secularism and fundamentalism in Islam. Quite poetic in parts, quite slow in others, quite often intriguing because of the narrative techniques used, blurring to some extent the line between fiction and reality, both within the plot and the novel itself. And it's a pity that the green notebook has been lost forever, as I was curious to read the 19 poems that came to Ka while he was in Kars.","Jan 14, 2016"
832008,Kana,"This book was almost added to the list of few books I never finished. I eneded up skimming through the last few chapters just to be done with it. This was basically because the author created characters with whom you never become engaged. The book's tone was so melancholy that it slowed the pace to a crawl. It leaves the reader feeling as if they are just following the main character, Ka, as he wanders aimlessly through the small town of Kars. Actually, aimless is a good way of summing up this book. The author kills any suspense that he has managed to build up by revealing what is going to happen before it happens. And if I had to read ""the falling snow made the streets so silent"" one more time, I was going to poke my eyes out.","Jan 25, 2008"
7742,Jennifer Chin,"Stories within stories, a narrator and characters who are at times completely honest and other times completely untrustworthy. As I read, I felt the only thing I could trust was the feelings of the moment, the deep flaws in each character unveiled at first with great nuance, and then shoved blatantly into my mind. The metaphor of snow is more than that; it comes to represent the one consistency through the novel, the ever-present flakes adding layer upon layer of meaning to the most simple moments. At times it reminded me of Nabokov's Pale Fire, where through the voice of an ever-shifting narrator, you cannot tell whose tale is whose. And after all, isn't that life - there is no one truth, only the stories we piece together from what we tell one another?","Apr 24, 2010"
3827721,Sharmita,"A book that sinks in slowly and be pretty much summed up by these lines said by one of the characters named Fazil :. “We’re poor and insignificant. Our wretched lives have no place in history. One day all of us living here in Kars today will be dead and gone. No one will remember us;no one will care what happened to us. We will spend the rest of our days here arguing about what sort of a scarf women should wrap around their head, and no one will care in the slightest as we’re eaten up by our own petty, idiotic quarrels. When I see so many people around me leading such stupid lives and then vanishing without a trace , an anger runs through me because I know then nothing really matters in life more than love.""","Dec 07, 2010"
3058645,Seleucid,"I understand that maybe Pamuk's point was to show the childish shallowness of the Turkish elite, their inability to survive in real Turkish society, or any other one for that matter, but Ka's character is too obnoxious and self-centered to bear. Every time he gets into one of his inner thoughts you disconnect yourself from the book in disgust.. The police are as childish as the protesters, the islamists, the marxists, the coup plotters. A whole book of delusional people you're supposed to sympathize with, you're supposed to understand, but the utter pointlessness of it forces you to stop. Maybe that was what Pamuk wanted.. The lead female characters were amazing people however, affirming my notion that in the Middle East, the woman is the one keeping it all sane. Bless them.","Jan 15, 2011"
1049533,Amy,"I just didn't buy into this one. One of the reviews in the front compared this to a Dostoevky novel. Snow is trying to raise social and philosophical issues but the difference is that Dostoevsky makes it a natural part of his story where this one's efforts seemed forced. And please don't tell me we were supposed to believe that there was an actual love story going on in there because not a single one of them elicited any emotion from me. And all the inspiration for Ka's poetry? I'm just not sure I saw it. With what Pamuk was trying to do, I should have the feeling of being engrossed in a story, moving along with where its trying to take me but instead I'm left feeling like I was just reading words on a page.","Jun 13, 2011"
6527309,John Carpenter,"I read Snow about five years ago after hearing Orhan Pamuk speak at Washington University in St. Louis. I loved the story, but as with most of Pamuk's works--at least, the three or four I've read, the prose is so very dense in places that it took me a long time to finish. That said, the journey was worth it, and having lived a year in Turkey made the story more ""see-able."" I also like Pamuk's penchant for symbolism--naming the main character Snow in an off-handed kind of way and having him fall in love with a woman called Silk. All of that set, of course, among murder and mysticism. And blood. The novel reminds me that it's a complex world, both internally and externally, and that relatively speaking, I have it pretty easy by comparison, when it comes to religion, politics, safety.","Nov 22, 2011"
2056419,Kate,"This was on a my TBR pile and I along with a couple of others suggested it for one of my book clubs. It was a heavy, dense read and at the end, almost none of us felt it was worth the effort. I appreciated the writing and descriptions, but the female characters were not fully evoked. Some of the scenes seemed crazy set ups, but the author in an afterword in another edition stated that most of what happened in the book, happened to him. At the book club meeting,it provoked an excellent discussion of Islam and to a lesser degree, most religions. How ""religious"" does someone have to be? Can you not follow all parts of a belief system yet consider yourself a member of a religion? We had no firm answers, but a lot of thoughtful comments.","Jul 03, 2012"
1982,Sheri,"I know this book has been hailed as a masterpiece and is a New York Times Best Book of the Year. While it was interesting, and I learned quite a bit about Turks and Islam, I found it to be wordy, boring and monotonous. It takes place over three days of snow falling. Kay is a poet coming back to the city if Kars to reclaim a former love. He is also going to report on the suicides of young girls who have been forbidden to wear head scarves. The writing felt extra tenuous to me and I was bogged down by all the detail of poverty, meetings with terrorists and police brutality and interference with common people who had no evil motives, just to make it through the next day.. Brilliant or not, this book wasn't for me.","Oct 20, 2012"
1882126,Nancy,"What a complicated read. Definitely not for everyone. I would perhaps have enjoyed it more had I a better understanding of Turkish politics and history. More interesting to me was Pamuk's 2005 court case in Turkey in which he was charged with making statements that were insulting to the Republic or Turkish Natl Assembly. The charges were dropped on a technicality. However, he was eventually found guilty following an appeal to the Supreme Court. His novel touches on the profound confusion of fundamentalist versus the invasion of Western secularism. I'm sure as a 'westerner' I fail to fully comprehend the complex motivations behind the Middle Eastern people's religious and political choices. This book goes a long way in exposing the elaborate influences.","Oct 30, 2012"
6675266,Neil,"Okay, I'm going to tell it as it is.  Nobel-winning writer aside, this book is insufferable.  I frankly don't understand the hype, the glowing reviews, attention from the New Yorker - this book is bad.  Really bad.. The story revolves around a privileged man in Istanbul who has a short affair with a shopgirl and proceeds to become completely obsessed with her.  So obsessed is he that after the girl marries someone else, he ends up sitting at their dinner table for the next 8 years.. When Kemal is not hopping around the latest upper-class Istanbul hotspots, he's becoming an expert kleptomaniac, pocketing everything around Füsun's house.  He reports back about his activities with glee - ""After having taken all those matchboxes, and Fusun's cigarette butts, and the saltshakers, the coffee cups, the hairpins, and the barrettes - things not difficult to pick up, because people rarely notice them missing - I began to set my sights on things like ashtrays, cups, and slippers…""  Several pages later, we find out that ""during my eight years of going to the Keskins' for supper, I was able to squirrel away 4,213 of Fusun's cigarette buts.  Each one of these had touched her rosy lips and entered her mouth, some even touching her tongue and becoming moist [shock of all shocks!] as I would discover when I put my finger on the filter soon after she had stubbed the cigarette out; the stubs, reddened by her lovely lipstick, bore the unique impress of her lips at some moment whose memory was laden with anguish or bliss…"". There are plenty of signs that Kemal's obsession is not well received.  Going back to cigarette stubbing, we find out that ""sometimes she would stub it out with evident anger, sometimes with impatience. I had seen her stub out a cigarette in anger many times, and this caused me disquiet."". This might be an interesting storyline if it wasn't the same old hogwash repeating itself for 560 pages.  There are entire chapters of this.  Allow me to list out some chapter names for you:  ""The Melancholy of Autumn"" is followed by ""Cold and Lonely November Days"".  A few chapters later, there is a chapter titled ""An Indignant and Broken Heart Is of No Use to Anyone."". Other reviewers have tried to find beauty in this book by its descriptions of Istanbul in the 1970's.  Some have claimed that Pamuk's ""museum"" is a commemoration of a time and a place in Istanbul and that the book tries to showcase a lost culture. I disagree.  Sure there are a few pages scattered here and there about Istanbul, and sure, the writing does shine in a few small  segments.  But the vast majority of the book is about Fusun's lips, tears, anger, family, dinners, cigarette butts, marriage, saltshakers, eyes, expressions and words.  These discourses have only the most tangential relation to anything enlightening about 1970's Istanbul.. There is a disconcerting conceit about the author, when he introduces himself as a character - ""This is how I came to seek out the esteemed Orhan Pamuk, who has narrated the story in my name and with my approval… I had also heard that he was a man lovingly devoted to his work and who took storytelling seriously.""  There is a lot more self-advertising in this book, but I won't delve into it.  Suffice it to say that I really suffered through this book and would have abandoned it were it not so bad that I spent most of my time thinking about how I would justify such a critical review of such a well-hyped book.","Oct 15, 2011"
183639,Irwan,"(Additional notes below). One thing I just realized, whenever I am about to finish reading a book, usually some sketchy ideas or sentences appear in my mind, so that right after I finish it, I can just open Goodreads, rate the book and write those ideas. I am also usually satisfied after writing three or four paragraphs, feeling that I have said what I have to say. But, I can't do that with Pamuk's books.. The night I finished this book, I was sitting at my desk with my hands laid on the closed book. I was staring past the glare of my computer screen. I smiled. Yes, I did smile! I slept soundly that night too. Rather victoriously... I felt that I had just concluded a life story of a dear friend whom I know so well. He was in love. A love that tortured him, exhilarated him, inspired him to do mad things for ""normal"" people. ""Normal"" meaning people who are not in love.. Reading this book was not all a joyride. There were moments, when obsession really caught Kemal, whom later I called a friend just because I know so much about him, that I wanted to slap him in the face and say ""Wake up! Enough already! Stop being this pathetic and get a life, man!"" Of course, he didn't do that. I almost stopped reading at this point. That is how rich and heavy Pamuk can describe obsession.. Then the story took its turn and the mood was changing. I was exhausted. I read a review somewhere that the love would not end happily as in fairy tales. Somehow tragic love story is more worth writing, so they say. So, I didn't have much hope for the bright light at the end of the tunnel. I just wanted to complete the journey. I was prepared for the worst.. But Pamuk is such a master story-teller. He didn't just give you a relief from this journey. He took you to another path. A heroic one. A path that only a mad person would take. Well, mad.. or brave. Or simply in love!. This crazy friend of mine was not set to build a Taj Mahal for his love. But a museum! A place where Time becomes Space. I know I will never look at a museum in the way I used to.. Humorous element gave an extra flavour to the already rich taste in the last part of the book. I like when Pamuk himself appeared on the stage and interacted with his own creations, tying up loose ends and wrapping up the story with a victorious last sentence. For those who haven't read the book or are still reading it: Yes, you can take a peek at it first if you want to. But I would rather leave it for later :-). =====. Additional note:. Finally Michael Silverblatt, the host of KCRW Bookworm podcast, interviewed Orhan Pamuk. So far, Silverblatt is the best talk show host for writers. Being an avid reader himself, his questions are insightful and often surprising to the writers themselves because he presents a point of view that the writers haven't thought of..

1889855,Grace Tjan,"I must confess that for the last five years, I have had a love and hate relationship with Orhan Pamuk (I also had a similar relationship with Charles Dickens, but that’s another matter altogether).. Pamuk’s style is meticulous and ornate, intensely introspective, sometimes deliberately repetitive, shot through with that particular Turkish kind of melancholy called ‘huzun’. At his best, his prose achieves a poetic, hypnotic quality that makes. My Name Is Red. such a compelling, mesmerizing read. But what John Updike described as a Proustian ‘arabesques of introspection’ could also easily devolve into interminable navel gazing that makes wading through his novels, such as. The White Castle. , a ponderous undertaking. This novel is a mixed bag of both the strengths and weaknesses of his style.. It begins promisingly enough with a love triangle between Kemal, the young scion of one of Istanbul’s wealthiest family, Sibel, his Sorbonne-educated fiancée, and Fusun, a poor, distant relation who happens to be a nubile 18 year-old beauty contest finalist. Their illicit romance, consummated in an empty apartment filled with his mother’s abandoned possessions (surely there’s a Freudian subtext here?), slowly consumes Kemal’s life, and yet he still clings to Sibel, who is not only understanding but is also willing to nurse him through lovesickness for her rival. This earlier part of the novel is quite compelling, although the eroticism occasionally veers towards the graphically icky territory (“As our kisses grew even longer, a honeyed pool of warm saliva gathered in the great cave that was our mouths combined, sometimes leaking a little down our chins…”). However, as Sibel finally gives up on her errant fiancée and Fusun contracts a reputation-saving shotgun marriage to an aspiring screenwriter, Kemal (and the narrative) becomes bogged down in a mire of repetitive, increasingly self-indulgent ruminations. This part depicts eight years of the characters’ lives in which the following happens:. 1.	Kemal hangs out with Fusun, her husband, and her parents;. 2.	while with her, he is transcendentally moved by some gesture or words from his beloved;. 3.	he steals (“collects”) things that remind him of such moments, such as the soda bottle that she drank from, the saltshaker that she used during dinner, the ceramic dog figurine that sat on top of her TV, cigarette butts (all 4,213 of them, meticulously classified according to how they were crushed),etc. He then carefully stores these items in the empty apartment and sometimes mouths them when he misses her;. 4.	he makes feeble, half-hearted attempts at producing a movie in which she is going to star in, but is eventually too repulsed by the notion that she will have to do a kissing scene --- or worse, be pawed over by actors and directors --- that he never goes through with it;. 5.	Fusun pouts and sulks;. 6.	Kemal is devastated;. 7.	repeat.. This goes on for hundreds of pages. There is a chapter titled ‘Sometimes’ (in which every sentence begins with that word) which contains nothing but random snippets of their daily life. It is cute for one or two pages, but exhausting as a chapter-length exercise.. I began to scan the pages. How long is this thing going to be on?. And then suddenly there was a twist in the story and it became good --- really good. I couldn’t stop reading --- and hoping. I forgave Kemal for being a borderline creep with his ‘collecting’ and I forgave Fusun for being so wrapped up in her acting ambition. I wanted them to drive away into the sunset in Kemal’s ’56 Chevrolet and live happily ever after in a Turkish dreamland.. And it all ends in a sigh --- a big sigh.. And suddenly you understand everything: the years of waiting, the lifetime of remembering, the significance of mundane things, the obsession with collecting, and why there is a need for so many museums in this world.. “In poetically well built museums, formed from the heart’s compulsions, we are consoled not by finding in them old objects that we love, but by losing sense of Time.”","Jun 30, 2010"

10551559,Chelsey,"An extremely tedious, depressing read.. I can honestly say that I read the first 150 pages, and then started skimming the rest (which I NEVER do, since I love reading) in search for dialogue.It is so melancholy and slow.. It reminded me of being in a room with an extremely self absorbed person, who blabbers on and on, touching the same points over and over again without really any concern if you're listening or not.. The writing style is also overly detailed, describing dry conversations with business associates, the Turkish movie industry, and one entire chapter was dedicated to a discussion about a clock in Fusun's home. Absolutely unnecessary!. It starts out well enough, with an interesting love triangle between Kemal, Fusun, and Sibel. I had high hopes that Kemal would take the high road and do the right thing (that is, break off his relationship with Sibel right away and start his pursuit of Fusun).. But NO! I did not feel an ounce of compassion for Kemal's plight. He was arrogant enough to think himself lucky to have a fiancée and mistress. He considered himself as part of an elite group of men happy enough to entertain the thought of having a wife and lover on the side.. In short, WHAT AN ASSHOLE!. I could see that he loved Fusun (or at the very least, was infatuated), but he didn't respect her enough to do what was right and break off his engagement to Sibel as soon as he started having an affair.. I felt extremely frustrated that it was Sibel, NOT Kemal, who eventually broke off the engagement.. My only consolation is that Kemal later acknowledges that he had been terribly irresponsible. Damn rights!. There was also a significant creep factor to Kemal's obsession with Fusun. I can sympathize that a parting gift to remind you of lost love can be soothing. But he takes his to a whole new level!. I hated him describing how he had a pair of her white panties on display in the museum (seriously??? Not cool, dude).. And how he'd ""mouth"" certain things he stole from her? Ewwww. Or how he'd try to imitate her and in some way, become Fusun? What a nut job.. But, being the romantic that I am, I rooted for them to end up together in the end. And when they finally do, I was elated! This whole depressing, awful book had suddenly been worth it. And then what happens?. Fusun dies! I won't give away all the details about how that happens, but it left me feeling as if the book had been meaningless.. Take two irresponsible, immature people, add sex to the equation and what do you get? An absolute disaster.. I had been excited to read this book, as I would love to see Turkey someday and thought it would be an incredible romance. But it ended up being horrible.. I can't believe this book has received so many 4 or 5 star ratings.","Nov 13, 2012"
2990642,Rowena,"“Time had not faded my memories (as I had prayed to God it might), nor had it healed my wounds as it is said always to do. I began each day with the hope that the next day would be better, my recollections a little less pointed, but I would awake to the same pain, as if a black lamp were burning eternally inside me, radiating darkness.”. — Orhan Pamuk, The Museum of Innocence. I must say, when I first started reading this book, I groaned inwardly. I had come across it while I was researching the Turkish word huzun (melancholia). However, I’m not a big fan of books with romantic storylines (I had my fill as a teen), and when I found out this particular romantic storyline was between two cousins, Kemal, a rich 30 year old who happens to be engaged, and 18 year old Fusun, a poor shopkeeper, I groaned even more.. Kemal is creepy! His obsession with Fusun didn’t sound believable at all to me. He gets to the point of collecting all of Fusun’s cigarette butts for his museum which is in honour of her, as well as other knick-knacks. I don’t think many men would collect their loved one’s cigarette butts and label them by date collected. Kemal reminds me a bit of Bella from Twilight in the sense that he dumps all his friends and family to obsessively mope over his love. This particular sort of angst isn’t becoming in someone over the age of 16.. The book did have some redeeming points. I’ve never read any books set in Turkey before and Pamuk sets the book in an interesting time period (the 1970s) when Turkey was still traditional but moving towards the modern. On top of that, there’s the political unrest. I think that made the story slightly more interesting. Discussions on the clashes of cultures between traditional Turkey and modern Turkey, including Turkish elites who had been educated in Europe and America, were interesting. I wish this part had been elaborated more because I would have liked a more in-depth comparison.. I got annoyed by the one-dimensional portrayal of women. I feel that Kemal only fell in love with Fusun because she was beautiful and had entered a beauty pageant. Kemal’s fiancée stayed with him despite knowing he cheated. Women were obviously looked at as mere trophies. Then again, that’s true in a lot of places even now.. I did get a Proustian feel while reading it. The protagonist’s musings were indeed very introspective but more obsessive than Proust’s, obsessive to a point that they didn’t seem believable, I’d say. Kemal was definitely absolutely obsessed and extreme but reading his thoughts was interesting.. Maybe not the best book to read on Christmas day but I'm glad I finally read something by Pamuk.","Nov 13, 2013"
1386971,Marieke,"I think this will be a short review because i don't want to give too much away. This is probably one of the more unique books i've ever read, done completely unpretentiously. most of the time i was reading it, i was thoroughly swept up in its melancholy atmosphere, but as the story began to resolve toward the very end, the tone lightened and i happily noted Orhan Pamuk's sense of humor and ability to make fun of himself. at least that is how i processed certain things at the end of the book.. as a novelized catalog of a very intimate and personal museum, the book cleverly documents one man's (Kemal) tragic attempt to spend his life happily with the one woman (Fusün) he truly loves. the reader knows from the outset that they are aboard a trainwreck, but it's never clear, despite hints all along the way, how the train will ultimately wreck and what will become of Kemal. The reader accompanies Kemal in his besotted state, followed by obsession, and then grief, observing with slight discomfort and sadness Kemal's years collecting various objects connected to Fusün in order to feel close to his beloved. Although we don't know until the end what becomes of Kemal or how his story got written, we do know what becomes of his collected objects. They are part of a museum and as we learn his story we are introduced to these objects, or perhaps, as we are introduced to these objects, we learn his story.. I don't know if the five stars will hold up, but i gave it five stars today because i got so entirely wrapped up in the story, and more so as it reached its resolution. i had expected the opposite to be true, but i was wrong. I also feel terrible that i have yet to read. Snow. , which i have been avoiding since i have been unable to finish. My Name is Red. and i had heard from several people that. Snow. is difficult.

5204784,Vonia,"Orhan Pamuk. Why have I waited so long to experience your writing? Because that is what this was. An experience. The Museum of Innocence has a deceitfully simple premise. Kemal Bey, from one of the wealthiest, more prominent families in Turkish society, is to be married to the lovely Sibel, daughter of a diplomat. She is well educated, beautiful, resourceful, well matched for his family even; no one can be anything but ecstatic at their engagement party, where they are on display for all of the nouveau riche to see. No one, that is, except for a young lycée graduate from the poor lower class family named Fusun. Having met only months ago when Kemal came into the gift store where she is employed for a purse for Sibel, the two lovers have since begun a series of rendezvous & barely hidden trysts that, now started, cannot be ended without great pain, trials, & sacrifices. Even worse, though Kemal (through a complex series of cognitive deceptions) is not aware of it at the time, his attachment to young Fusun has become so rich, so deep, so ""fated"", so obsessive, that the groom to be himself shares her sentiments.. Although Sibel is obviously devastated when she finds out, she remains with him for months after, trying to support his ""recovery"". This, of course, is not to be. His love, his obsession with Fusun inevitably leads to the abandonment of his fiancée, a near perfect marriage/family, the family company, his status in Turkish societies, & many of his closest friends as he devotes almost another decade ""winning Fusun back"" (whom is now herself married). He visits Fusun four to five times a week for eight years, ingratiating himself with her family; they become more family to him than his own as the years elapse. He even becomes friends, then business partners, with Fusun's aspiring film director husband Feridun. Serving as a cover for his frequent visits to the Kreskin household is his monetary support on Lemon Films, which in turn supports an interestingly complex but unstated understanding between Kemal and Feridun, whom are both vying for the same young lady; sadly, the more deeply felt, true love is hidden, unable to be discussed, while the neatly arranged marriage founded on convenience and something closer to an affinity is what everyone openly imagines and acknowledges. Reading about Turkish cinema, the difficulties with the censor board, young stars trying to remain chaste in the harsh eyes of the public; Kemal and Feridun networking in local bars, Kemal and Fusun watching both Turkish and international films in classic theaters together, first with Feridun then without, first as distant cousins that avoid acknowledging each other, then looking at each other under the soft glow of lights with as much passion and devotion as any long married husband and wife, holding hands with such delicate coyness, I was reminded of something akin to Lolita, The Unbearable Lightness Of Being, Cinema Paradiso, Amelie. There is whimsy, love, loyalty, unstated values, honor and chaste societal expectations, secrets, obsession, mystery, and many illogical decisions in the name of love.. Indeed, his life is completely transformed; though his life continues, for the most part Kemal Bey lives for one purpose, one aim, one girl. As the love story came to a conclusion, I was aware of the thought that this was the first time, at least in quite some time, that such a detailed, complex, saga-like, epic-akin storyline was written to conclusion with such perfection. It was not necessarily an expected, clear, neat ending, but any ambiguity, any decisions the author made that I did not agree with, was unable to remove the smile from my face, the warm, cozy feeling inside as if I had had a warm cup of hot chocolate.. Then, what do you know, another part of Kemal's story begins. The perfect book gets better. He outlines his single minded determination to establish The Museum Of Innocence. Pamuk insightfully forays into the psychology of collecting, collectors, their collections. What makes these people pursue such a passion? Is it true that it is always reflective of a psychological flaw? At what point does a respected, admired endeavor become an obsession? An unappreciated flaw? Which is correct, the ""proud"" Western collector, whom strives to display there collections for public appreciation? The ""bashful"" Non-Western collector whom hides it, shunned by their peers? A museum connoisseur myself, I truly loved reading about all the real life museums and/or private collections Kemal visited worldwide as he reflected on his life this far, lived for Fusun.. This is what I cherish about fiction. Nonfiction ""Elitist"" Readers question the value of fiction. The right amount of disconnect from real life, what they do not realize, is necessary for full absorption of topics that may be uninteresting otherwise. There is so much more to learn, question, explore, discover in fiction in ways more beautiful than the straight facts of nonfiction can.. Throughout the main novel, Kemal Bey refers to Orhan Pamuk a few times, and I loved that an author would put himself in his novel, especially when he was sometimes referred to in a negative way. A great author should always know how to laugh at himself! At the end of The Museum Of Innocence, we learn that Kemal Bey hired Pamuk to write what we have finished reading in his voice. His aim was to have readers really know his story, his Fusun, his life. As readers, a free admission to his Museum has been placed between to paragraphs of text in the last few pages. He tells Orhan Pamuk that the last thing that must be included in the book; what the readers need to realize, is that he, Kemal, ""have lived a good life."". What brings The Museum Of Innocence to such a level, of course, is Orhan Pamuk's elegiac, incomparable prose. To portray so much, such visual imagery with seemingly so few words; to describe specific emotions with such preciseness yet eloquently. At chapters, this is a long novel. Yet I always found myself desperately looking at the pages on the right side of my hand, wishing they would always be more than those on my left! There are so many passages that I would love to quote here (i.e. 1) Describing the love you can have simple watching someone, holding items they once held; 2) The chapter illuminating Kemal & Fusun's ""language of looks"", how meaningful a look, even a non-look could be, during his eight years visiting her family under the guise of assisting her & her husbands' film careers, 3) The kinship he discovered in the subculture of collectors, touring the world to visit museum after museum of niche collections, finding he was not alone, 4) The almost-story-in-itself regarding the passage of time, how we use time to guide us in conducting our lives as it relates to outside society, but to truly live is to live without clocks, as they did in Fusun's house for a time), but I shall leave those hidden gems for you, the next formidable reader of this great novel!","May 14, 2014"
63168028,Peter,"Obsession. The Museum of Innocence. is a novel developed with significant depth in relation to the main character, Kemal, and the obsession he has towards a beautiful woman, Fusan. Kemal never managed to secure a full relationship with Fusan because of his obliged engagement to marry Sibel. He always remained infatuated and felt she held his heart. The obsession manifested itself through Kemal collecting objects that had a connection with her, from cigarette butts to kitchen-ware. He would collect anything and everything that she encountered as though it harboured her essence, which he could derive pleasure from.. Kemal marries Sibel but he never fully commits his heart in his marriage, which he has pledged part of to Fusan. He has created this idol, which has grown in standing and adoration, that in his own mind is far superior to the reality. This is actually really sad and I do think more could have been made of his wife's feelings, and what she contended with throughout their marriage.. Over the years Kemal collects so many items that he finally establishes a museum of memorabilia devoted to Fusan. A Museum of Innocence. Or a Museum of Impotence. Depending on your grip of reality. :). Kemal is a very frustrating person and someone that I have very little empathy with. While we don't have to love every character in a story it's very difficult to connect with the story when you dislike ALL the characters. On a positive note, I appreciate the opportunity to look into the mind of someone so different and wonder was his conscious and subconscious mind a driving force to, hold onto something OR fear of letting go? So are you intrigued or frustrated, are you inspired or unimpressed, or are you wondering what other books I could have read during the time it took to read this 752-page monster?. The writing is never in question and it conveys an imaginary into Istanbul that is wonderful and atmospheric. The level of detail of places and people is remarkable and while I’ve never been, it conveys the cultural and material clash between the West and the Middle East, especially with the more affluent of society.. Personally, I couldn't recommend this book and I've often wondered why I saw it through. Maybe this was the book that convinced me that Not Finishing a book is a legitimate decision.","Feb 24, 2018"
8676809,Gearóid,"It was quite an experience reading this book.. At one stage i almost abandoned it as i just had. too much of Kemal's obsession and it was getting a bit tiresome.. However,while i was not reading the book and moved on to other books i keep thinking about it and realised it was beautifully written.The descriptions of Istanbul life in the 1970's and 1980's were so brilliant.. I would be having a coffee in my local cafe(wet and damp and indoors) and would start thinking about Istanbul and the warm feeling i got when reading about drinking raki or Turkish Tea on the Bosphorus in the sunshine.How cool is that!I could almost smell the Turkish tea.. The only writer who effected me like that before was Hemingway although. their styles are totally different.. Kemal's obsession with Fusun and his robbing of little knick knacks was a bit tiresome but i am really glad i did not abandon the book and returned to complete it.. Orhan Pamuk is some writer.You can see he really loves his country and his people and really goes to great lengths to let you understand Istanbul and the Turkish people.. It must have taken a lot of energy to write a book like this.. I really loved this book and have three more Orhan Pamuk books lined up ready to go.","Dec 28, 2013"
7481492,Margitte,"I have been trying to finish this novel for such a long time. It took three tries. Third time lucky. I finally finished it.. An obsessive man shares his memories of a doomed love affair in a society where East and West are fusing. There is a confusion of cultures driven by mosques on the one hand, and malls on the other, which leads to civil unrest and even war in the vibrant ancient city of Istanbul.. I did not manage to become as obsessed as single-minded Kamul with Füsun, the eighteen-year old girl, and that makes a difference in as far as I was willing to tolerate his stream of consciousness drive to conquer and take possession of the object of his lust. His ignorance of the violence playing out on the streets of the city, while pursuing his goal, does not alter his vivid descriptions of a city in transition as the cultural and political situation pendulum in daily tumult.. The elaborate backdrop is the 1970s and '80s in Turkey. The style is similar to Nabokov's Humbert and his Lolita, about a man and the woman he loves, but also his love for his city.. I was wondering if Füsun, his unforgettable love interest, does not represent the western lifestyle, even America. I can just imagine how important this novel is in the Turkish psyche, exposing the deeper state behind the religious and political mantras ruling over the inhabitants. It serves as an open letter to a divided society, telling the truth where lies are preferred. A quest for tolerance, respect, understanding.. Nevertheless, the repetitious nature of Kamul's obsession dampened my enthusiasm for this novel. There might be a lot of symbolism which got lost on me. It just became tedious and boring. Although it was only 400 pages long, it felt typical of what Stephen King confessed about his own novels: being “literary elephantiasis” - that is, his novels tend to bloat.. However, this novel is an important literary event and deserves the many awards it has won. I'm just happy to have finished it. It is too high to come by for me personally.","Sep 26, 2017"

3385229,jeand99,"Aren't we all surrounded by thousands of tiny little things of the ones we love(d)?. ""What a bore is life and how predictable: to be born, live and die."" This is what I told my grandma (from my mothersside) at the age of eight after reading next weeks TV-guide completely. She looked at me with a little mysterious smile and said ""Yes, you are right"". I was old at the age of eight. The strange thing is this feeling never really left me. In retrospect my opinion back than was only a part of 'homo sapiens' life' truth. In life it's not about milestones it's about all the days in between. It's not about being born, learn to ride a bicycle, fall in love, graduate at highschool, buy a house, become a (grand)parent and die. It's about the 26.000 days in between. Sometimes we think we will never really fall in love. Sometimes we are in doubt about the love we feel. Sometimes we hate our lover. Sometimes it feels as if we are not good enough for our lover and need above all affirmation. Sometimes it's a perfect day full of love and being loved. Sometimes we don't think at all about our lover - and feel guilty when we realize that. What I'm trying to say is, we (better: I) live our life one day after another. In retrospect we can put milestones in our personal life but it's hardly sensible in the days we are living one by one. Yesterday is one day. Today is one day. Tomorrow and all the other days are one day.. All bookreviews tell more about the reviewer than about the writer of a book. I'm completely aware of that. Last weekend I finished reading Orhan Pamuk' (1952-) book 'The museum of innocence' (in a dutch translation). From a milestone point of view this book is a bore. 30 year old male Pamuk falls in love with 18 year female Fusun while he is going to be engaged in a few weeks with 26 (?) year old female Sibel. The setting is Istanbul, Turkey in the seventies (of the 20th century). Pamuk and Sibel are both rich and are the perfect couple. Fusun is poor.. I was completely addicted to the book after reading the first 20 pages. I knew - not really but I guessed how it would end otherwise there would have been no reason for a ""museum"" - how the book was going to end but I loved all those thousands and thousands of tiny little lovely details of a love. A love between Kemal and Sibel. A love between Kemal and Fusun. All the hesitations, the anger, the insecurity, the perfect moments, the jealousy, the lack of affirmation, the tears, the smiles and the feeling of happiness when you just can touch her or finally see her smile while she looks at you. I loved to read about all the ""normal"" days when Kemal was surrounded by things of Fusun: touching the saltshacker that once stood at Fusun' house, smelling at the red dress Fusun wore on the day of Kemal and Fusun' engagement and drinking from a glass Fusun once drank out of.. This is it. This is life. For me it's a book of love in all it's tiny little elements. It is telling it all: the hesitations, the good and bad moments and all the feelings in between. It's not a book of milestones. It's a book of all the days in between. For me personally to found a museum for the love-of-my-life is too much. It would be too neurotic. I'll never found a museum for the ones I loved so much and the ones I love right now. I'll never found a museum for the love-of-my-life but aren't we all surrounded by hundreds of things, books, smells, songs, thoughts and dreams of the ones we love(d)?. P.s.

4810137,Arda,"After finishing ""The Museum of Innocence,"" I found myself in need to talk about it. I wanted my friends to know about this, but I wanted them to know about it slowly, in small drips, and tiny pieces.. -""Do you have time for another cup of coffee?"" I'd ask, ""This might take a while, but chances are this book might be too long for your taste and you might not want to read it yourself, but you have to at least hear me out till the end. Let me tell you about it!"". It's not typical of me to do this sort of thing. I rarely share stories orally and usually do not even have the patience to tell a short joke, much less listen to one. But everything about ""The Museum of Innocence"" was different. With this, Orhan Pamuk first created an idea, then built an idea, then created a reality for his idea, and he gave a different meaning to the word ""Imagination"", and he left me with no option but to want to TELL, to HAVE TO tell, about the ""Museum of Innocence."". Yet this is supposed to be a review so I cannot sit here and write my own summary to the book and what it represents and spoil it in this review. But what I will say is: yes, you need to read this, and yes, it will make you look at objects differently. It might make you look at life differently. In fact, this book might have a chance to ruin you. It might seduce you and leave you with no choice to resist it, and yes, it might actually ruin you. But would I still recommend it for you? The answer is yes.. If you do not plan to read the book, then I hope we'll meet one day. I'll ask you whether you have time for a cup of coffee, and if you're willing to hear me out, I'll be happy to tell you about ""the museum of innocence."".

5041069,Lillian,"I'm not sure what to think of this book. I loved Pamuk's memoir, Istanbul: Memories and the City. But this novel, which covers much of the same material from a fictional perspective, with a woman, instead of a city as the focus of attention, was a frustrating read. The cataloging of every meaningful interaction with Fusun, the focus of Kemal's obsession, and the collecting of thousands of objects she touched or that are associated with her, does capture something ... a period of time? Reading this novel was in many ways like sitting trapped at a table with a very self-involved person who talks endlessly about things that might be entertaining in small doses, but become mind-numbing the longer the person continues to talk. My biggest problem with Kemal was this: ""Like most Turkish men of my world who entered into this predicament, I never paused to wonder what might be going on in the mind of the woman with whom I was madly in love, and what her dreams might be; I only fantasized about her."" I read somewhere that it is Fusun whom Orhan Pamuk identifies with. So is he portraying through Kemal the West's idealized, but very limited understanding of Turkey? One very lovely idea Pamuk expounds upon through Kemal is that of the value of ""sitting together"" ... ""Touching in the most innocent way upon my main reason for being there -- my desire to be in the same place as Fusun -- the word ""sit"" suited me perfectly. Unlike those intellectuals who deem it a solemn duty to deride the people and who believe that the millions of people in Turkey who talked of ""sitting together"" every evening were congregating to do nothing, I, to the contrary, cherished the desire expressed in the words ""to sit together"" as a social necessity amongst those bound by family ties, of friendship, or even between people with whom they feel a deep bond, though they might not understand its meaning."" Maybe that is what I am taking away from this novel, the experience of having ""sat"" with Kemal, and in a way, with Orhan Pamuk.","Apr 09, 2011"

And it's set in Istanbul in 1975, with excursions to the present.. I know more about Istanbul in 1835 than 1975, though the latter is within my own lifespan. (Okay, okay, WELL within my own lifespan.) I like Turkish history because it's so improbable and so full of moments when they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory! I like alternate history so I love those moments where things could have gone either way...rich fodder for imaginings.. I thought this book, about the life lived by a wealthy man who seduces his poor, estranged teenaged cousin in his mother's extra apartment would fill in a gap for me.. Ew.. The obsessiveness with which this poor schmoe turns his very real guilt over his cousin's blighted life into a passion for collecting the minutuae and ephemera of that life is, well, distasteful. It's just amazing to me to imagine that kind of passionate hold a person has over another, and for such a negative reason.. The cousin dies, of course, because no bad girl can live, right? And the man withers and wastes away, insisting to the author (who appears as himself, called ""Orhan Bey,"" in what I can only describe as a grandstandy little bit of Maguffinry) that he's led a happy life, tell the story of the happy life, as he's about to die at, what, sixty? Codswallop! He's led a miserable half-life, and quite appropriate too, and frankly the only thing that keeps this from being a 50s Ann Bannon lesbian romance is the gender of the protagonist and the Nobel Prize for Literature that Orhan Bey has won..

66366804,Usman Hickmath,"Kemal, a 30 year old son of a wealthy Istanbul family, about to be engaged to a girl named Sibel, falls in love with an 18 year old shop girl Fusun- a distant, poorer relation of Kemal. Fusun also confesses her love to him and disappears after attending his engagement with Sibel. In his pursuit of Fusun over the next eight years, Kemal becomes a compulsive collector of objects that records his lovelorn progress, amassing a museum.. Having only two brief instances of lovemaking in a 500 pages long novel, where protagonist is erotically and emotionally obsessed with his lover, is a courageous effort. Such a feat can only be achieved when an author is determined to tell what he believes in and doesn't force things to spice up the story..

5407952,Jibran,"This is a story of an obsessive love of a rich Istanbul businessman who is engaged to be married but falls in love with a distant relation of his, a teenage girl; and there begins a long string of attempts that recount the ridiculous, comical lengths he would go to try to win the love of the girl of his desire.. He slides into a permanent state of profound inertia, into a complete and thorough uselessness. His work suffers neglect, his relations with friends and family are impaired, and his whole existence seems to hinge on the question of love. Be that as it may, he is focused on one and one thing only: to make himself available to the girl of his dreams by any and every mean possible.. This routine continues for eight years during which the story is obsessively and repetitively told to highlight the centre of gravity in his life, through the littlest of details and chance happenings that give him an illusion of getting near his goal. In his obsessive pursuit he takes to collecting mementos of the girl and builds a personal ""museum of innocence"" where he lovingly and longingly displays those objects. From used cigarette butts to combs, a stolen earring to other personal and impersonal objects - he collects everything that reminds him of the girl. But he or his beloved do not know what the life has in store for them!. More broadly, the novel depicts the lifestyle of upper class Istanbulites during the decades of 1970s and 1980s, a period of immense social and political change in the life of modern Turkey. This is a snapshot of Istanbul’s upper classes who are negotiating their modern paradoxes of identity and destiny, which is one of the strongest themes in Pamuk's works. One eternal question sits at the heart of their conundrum: are they European or not? Should they do and behave like European to modernise themselves? Or uphold their traditions and keep their customs and still be counted modern and enlightened?. The story kind of stalls in the middle, loses its movement completely, so I had to plod through it. Things begin to take shape by the end but the effort is frustrated by an abrupt and unsatisfactory ending. But all in all, this is a typical Pamuk book that evokes a keen sense of the time and place and takes you inside the minds and hearts of its characters and into the world they inhabit with great skill.","Dec 28, 2014"

It sat on my to read shelf for a year or so, until a long haul voyage, even worse, a long haul voyage with flu, was about to happen. Wondering what was possessing me, I put this in my bag. Now or never. Worst case it would find a new home in Australia. Best..... Well, best, it turned out, was amazing. Despite having the flu, despite seats right next to the toilet (really disgusting, just don't do it), I couldn't put down this book. It is a fascinating account of Istanbul in the fifties through seventies and worth reading just for that. A small, but topical aside, is the reminder that Islamic terrorism against Westernisation has always existed. It is part of the backdrop of this story. It means physical danger, it means for women, harassment as they try to shake off oppression. It is about the divide that people on social media would have you think is new: urban vs rural, when it has always been there. How could one think otherwise?. There is graphic detail here of simple things like how it was going to the cinema - Pamuk is willing to lavish any number of words to paint his pictures. Minimalist he is not. But extravagantly sitting over all this is the story. The story of how a sexist wealthy Turk in the normal course of affairs thinking that he could have a wife on the one hand and his love on the other, discovers that he can't. He is split asunder and suffers such pain when he realises his terrible mistake that he is willing to surrender the rest of his life to trying to fix the situation, turn back the clock, and pick his mistress for his wife.

It's a story about love..especially loving Istanbul.. Kemal bey the thirty-something year old man fell in love with an eighteen year old girl ""Füsun"" and was confused about giving up on everything he has that seems like a perfect life and go after his love or not.. However, this story is a background to Orhan's perfect narration of the aristocratic class of Istanbul after the calling off of the Ottoman empire and the rise of capitalism and secular appeals which are described as ""westernization"" of Turkey. So, basically Orhan is telling us historic facts and events in form of a novel.. Don't hang on the love story and enjoy the description of the society, because I did at the first few chapters. I complained it was going on slowly with the incidents of the love story but after that, I realized the beauty of the novel regardless of Kemal bey agony. Orhan is telling the smallest detail in everything and everyone in this novel, it can be irritating and also amusing.. It's important to notice that Kemal bey portrayed the Turk's confused mind and Füsun represented the modern Turkey that was captured into the traditional surrounding mindsets.. The obsessive hoarding in the novel led to opening the Museum of Innocence in Turkey, and I visited it myself last September, it was really beautiful and on each object they wrote down the phrase that was mentioned in the novel about it.. Bring your copy if you are going to visit Istanbul because you will be guaranteed a free entrance to the museum. And, I found out that there are museums around the world that is keen on representing the normal objects in the country houses in them as was mentioned in this novel.. Back to the novel, I liked the description of Time as he said it and so many other things that I quoted.

1241853,Erin,"I just finished this book and despite the writing style (which reminded me of Gabriel Garcia Marquez) I ended up hating the main character and the book.. Like a lover you can't trust, the author led me down a long, winding path and eventually took advantage of me - and believe me, after sticking with this book for more than 500 pages I was expecting a little bit more. The first 200 pages were frustrating but I carried on, in hopes that sometime we'd get somewhere good. However, I started to get suspicious on page 398 when I came to a chapter called ""Sometimes"" where the entire chapter was comprised of one paragraph and every sentence in that paragraph started with the word ""sometimes"": Sometimes I helped take the dirty plates into the kitchen; Sometimes we'd hear gunshots in the distance; Sometimes we ate fried anchovies. By the time I got to the rather anticlimactic climax on page 489 I was thinking ""I should have known"" and then the plot just disintegrated into 30 pages about various museums around the world and their contents.. The main character, Kemal, was a bit of a loser as well - certainly not someone with whom I could empathize. Basically he was an indecisive, cowardly, selfish kleptomaniac who came up with the idea of a museum more as a way to assuage his guilt than anything else.. The plot was really non-existent - with about one major plot point per every 50 pages. In short, the book was in need of editing.. I would say the most redeeming aspects of The Museum of Innocence were insights into life in Istanbul, the modernist form of Islam unique to Turkey, the corruption & unrest in modern Turkey and the role of women in Turkish society. Those aspects made the book worthwhile but I can't forgive the lack of plot and the overall creepiness of the main character.","Dec 22, 2010"

4054892,Tocotin,"I think I'm just too forgiving when it comes to certain authors. I want to like them and to trust them because they write about topics or cultures I'm interested in, and then they let me down. So down. This is my third Pamuk novel, and I may be done with the guy. I liked ""The White Castle"". ""My Name Is Red"" was meh. I thought it immature and shallow, despite the fascinating subject. I kept waiting for some revelation, some deep insight, and it never came. It was the same with this book.. The first half, no, one-third, was great. There was drama, love, difficult choices, and Istanbul (ISTANBUL!!!) in the background. Then the main character abandoned his friends, his family, his whole former life, and started obsessing over his love interest without really loving her or knowing anything about her. Nothing happened. Nothing. The author himself seemed to buy the dude's pathetic interpretation of what happened to him, and did not care for anyone else. Of course the girl's fate must have been resolved in the way it did - you guessed it, I'm not gonna spell it out - and it all ended on a weird self-congratulatory note (it's a first-person narrative) when in fact there was nothing even remotely good about the dude's actions. He was creepy, selfish and dangerously crazy due to serious sexual starvation. The conclusion is naive and simplistic. The women are stick figures. Yet the author apparently believes that he has written a great love story, or at least a moving and memorable one. And the critics have the gall to compare it to ""Madame Bovary"" and ""Anna Karenina"" - why? Because Pamuk got a Nobel Prize? If so, then the book is the best of the three, because neither Tolstoy nor Flaubert got any prizes, right? You make me sick, critics. Just go away and don't pretend you know all because you are familiar with a couple of names.. I may try and give Pamuk one more chance with ""Istanbul"", but I'm not sure. He starts to remind me of Garcia Marquez whom I dislike intensely.","Jul 16, 2012"
1605591,Christine,"This is one of those books that has the most perfect title. There could be no other title for the book.. I haven't read anything by Pamuk before reading this, but I am so going to read everything by him.. Earlier this year, I read. The Dead of Winter. by. Lisa Appignanesi. . Both Pamuk and Appignanesi seem to have tread the same ground. What is the difference between love and obessession? Where, if anywhere outside of physical threats and attacks, does it cross the line? Pamuk does a slightly better job at exploring this idea (though Appignanesi book is very good too). He takes it to another level.. The story is mostly told from the viewpoint of Kemal and is told as if the reader is touring the museum of the title. What is magnificent outside of that device, is the way that the reader feels thurst into a point of, not so much judge and jury, but in a sadness that Kemal can't feel. The reader know how it is going to end, the reader asks questions about whether the romance is really a romance, yet the reader is compelled to keep reading. To stop would be a sin, would be wrong, would be the worse thing in the world.. Be warned, it is far more than the romance that the blurbs on my edition hawked it as. To call it a romance does it an injustice. It is about the nature of life and how to be happy, but then again, it's not.","Dec 15, 2010"
1464605,Ben,"A magnificent obsession turns fatal. A review by Ben Antao. The Museum of Innocence. By Orhan Pamuk. Translated by Maureen Freely. Knopf Canada, 536 pages, $34.95. In an interview in Mumbai recently, Orhan Pamuk, 57, the author of The Museum of Innocence, said rather petulantly, “When Proust wrote on love, everybody read it as universal love; when I write about love, they call it Turkish love.”. Having read both Proust and Pamuk’s novel, I felt a tinge of sympathy for the Turkish Nobel prize winner of 2006. But The Museum of Innocence is not Remembrance of Things Past, although both works are deep explorations of love through untiring attempts to recreate the lost past.. In Pamuk’s novel, a 30-year-old, wealthy Turkish playboy named Kemal begins an affair with his distant cousin Fusun, 18, a shop girl who is poor but beautiful. He does this despite the fact that he’s engaged to a woman educated in Paris, of his own social class, and westernized enough to sleep with him before marriage.. The conflict in this ménage à trois makes for a tantalizing story to sustain the reader’s interest for some time. However, the author narrating in the first person through the voice of Kemal goes overboard needlessly to carry on the affair that takes on the complexion of an obsession.. Following his formal engagement to Sibel, 28, Fusun disappears. And Kemal pursues her with the zeal of a madman, out of his mind and out of control. His obsession for Fusun is so extravagant as to be unbelievable. For the next eight years, he’s collecting objects that have come into contact with Fusun—hair clips, salt shakers, dog ornaments and, check this, 4213 cigarette butts (a whole chapter is devoted to these stubs, about 1600 words). All these items would house his museum of innocence, a state akin to happiness in Kemal’s view, a neat conceit.. The first person narrative hinders the author to crawl inside the heart and soul of Fusun, for although we see her physically, we are denied access to her psychological state, her rages and her resentments. But the first person POV enables the author to get in on the story’s action towards the end by advising the reader that Orhan Pamuk himself has been retained to tell Kemal’s story of obsession and his search for the innocent (happy) past now lost. In this effort, Pamuk even brings in Proust to justify his obsessive desire to reclaim the past.. It’s a challenge to sustain the reader’s interest in a story of love’s obsession that goes over 500 pages. And Pamuk probably felt that he could do a Proustian take on love’s conquest and loss. However, as the story ends, the reader knows better and feels that he’s been taken on a long ride through the streets of Istanbul, joy rides on the Bosphorus, but as for recovering lost love, it seems like much ado about nothing. It’s a fantasy love that does affect certain men who seek to relive the past. Kemal’s protestation of love for Fusun— such pain, such bliss—while in the company of his betrothed Sibel stretches the reader’s credulity; either he’s faking it or believes arrogantly he can enjoy them both, a wife and a mistress on the side. The inherent irony in this situation is charmingly sustained.. The lovemaking scenes are not explicitly described, but for the foreplay of kissing. Here’s a kissing scene between Kemal and Fusun, and a sample of Pamuk’s writing style.. “I think about you so much that there’s no room in my mind for mathematics,” she said, laughing self-mockingly, as if what she’d said meant nothing, as if it were a stock phrase taken from a film, but then she turned deep red.. “Had she not blushed so deeply, and betrayed such sorrow, I would have gone along with the joke. We would have acted as if it hadn’t occurred to either of us that this was the day of my engagement party. …But melancholy inhibited our lovemaking and finally tainted it. At one point Fusun lay stretched out on the bed, as if she were a patient listening to her pain, and watching mournful clouds pass overhead.. “We shared a whiskey in a glass that once belonged to Ethem Kemal—my grandfather, who was her great-grandmother’s second husband—and we began to kiss. As I write these words I feel I should take care not to cause undue upset to those concerned souls who have taken an interest in my story, for a novel need not be full of sorrow because its heroes are suffering. …As always, we kissed each other gracefully, having become so proficient in this art. As our kisses grew ever longer, a honeyed pool of warm saliva gathered in the great cave that our mouths combined, sometimes leaking a little down our chins, while before our eyes the sort of dreamscape that is the preserve of childish hope began to take form.. “From time to time, one of us would, like a ravenous bird taking a fig into its beak, such upon the other’s upper or lower lip, as if about to swallow it, biting the imprisoned lip, as if to say, Now you’re at my mercy! And having enjoyed this adventure of lips, and the frisson of being at someone else’s mercy, and awakening, at that moment, to the thrilling prospect of complete surrender, not just of one’s lips but of one’s entire body to a lover’s mercy, we recognized that the gap between compassion and surrender is love’s darkest, deepest region.”. This tragic story is not a Turkish love story nor is it a universal love story. It’s a story that could only happen in a world of fiction, a world that Pamuk understands well. The author is obviously well acquainted with the bourgeois society of Istanbul, having grown up there in the 70s when the action in the novel takes place. Currently, Pamuk lives in Goa with his writer girlfriend Kiran Desai, 38, writing a new novel.. Ben Antao, a Canadian Goan living in Toronto, is a journalist and novelist who has published five novels and several short stories and non-fiction. Blood & Nemesis, Penance, The Tailor’s Daughter, Living on the Market and The Priest and His Karma are his novels.

8641338,Fiona,"4 stars for the book but 3.5 stars for my personal experience as it's never a good thing when I'm so relieved to reach the last page!. With characters such as Conniving Suhendan, Faruk the Mouse, Hilmi the Bastard, Left-Handed Sermin, Guven the Ship Sinker and Shithead-With-A-Mustache, and a central character who has created a museum out of the most mundane objects imaginable, there is a lot to be enjoyed. In a nutshell, Kemal is in a long term relationship with the woman he expects to marry when he falls in love with a shopgirl (a distant relation), Fusun. He becomes totally obsessed by this 'other woman' to the point where everything else in his life becomes peripheral. To say too much more is to give away the entire storyline, such as it is. Suffice to say that, from the beginning, Kemal collects everything from fagends to earrings to crockery, cutlery and ornaments - anything that has been in contact with Fusun - and this eventually becomes The Museum of Innocence.. This is a novel about obsession and boy is this guy obsessed! For example Chapter 68, 4,218 Cigarette Stubs, is solely about the ways in which Fusun smokes cigarettes. This is where I have a problem with Pamuk. Sometimes he becomes so bogged down in detail that the reader can't help but feel less would be more. This book could have been at least 10 chapters shorter without losing anything. On another level, it's also a very instructive social, cultural and political history of mid 20th century Istanbul. I learned more about Turkey's history in this novel than I've learned from some travel and history books. I also learned more about the Turkish film industry than I cared to! An underlying theme is the pull from the West that attracts 'modern' Turks who would like to live their lives in a Western way, as seen in the movies, while simultaneously being steeped in a cultural tradition that demands that women are virgins when they marry. The background to Kemal's story is the civil war in the 1970s, a time of street battles and curfews that are merely a distraction to his sole interest in life, being near Fusun.. At times, I was frustrated with Kemal. He is really quite infuriating at times and I just wanted to give him a good shake! Fusun is a deeply unhappy and self-obsessed young woman for whom it's hard to feel any empathy. Pamuk himself makes an appearance towards the end of the novel which is quite entertaining and he interviews some of the main characters so that we see Kemal and Fusun's story from the perspective of friends and relatives.. I was thoroughly enjoying the pace of the novel and the storyline until around Chapter 60 at which point I just wanted to shout Please Release Me, Let Me Go! 11 or 12 chapters later, as the story starts to reach its climactic ending, I was interested again. By this time however, I was weary and had started to look forward to my next book. Never a good sign. Recommended but only if you have more patience than me. I'm told that's not difficult!","Apr 20, 2017"
1268056,Minh,"**Stopped reading after 200 pages**. I just...couldn't...do it anymore. I really tried to stick with it but Kemal Bey is probably one of the most annoying and creepiest guy (or douchebag, in some cases) I've ever come across in the fiction world. I lumbered through around 100 pages of his affair with Fusun, and then practically dragged myself through 100 more pages of his constant whining and ""heartache"" and just plain old annoying-ness.. I just got tired of him and the painfully slow-developing story. I mean, the plot was going NOWHERE. And I really didn't want to trudge through 300 more pages of Kemal Bey's philosophy on life. Don't get me wrong. I love it when characters start philosophizing or whatever. But Kemal Bey is annoying as hell. And I don't like annoying people telling me anything.. Anyway, so I decided to just quit with the novel. It's 500 pages of just...nothingness, it seems. I didn't even truly like Pamuk's narrative style - it was just too boring. I did feel guilt as I put the book away, but I convinced myself it was for the better. It's like a relationship, right? If your book and you aren't gelling, then might as well let it go. No hurt feelings if it's mutual! Well, I don't know if the feeling was mutual for Kemal Bey. Knowing him for around 200 pages, he'd probably start obsessing over me and continue being the big creepster that he is while whining until kingdom comes. Whatever Kemal. Deuces to you, bud.","Sep 12, 2011"
1927524,Nick,"The Museum of Innocence--which Orhan Pamuk has established in Istanbul--is a collection of earrings, barrettes, ceramic dog figurines, even cast-off cigarette butts, all of which remind the narrator of this novel, Kemal, of the object of his obsession, a poor relation named Fusun. To his credit, Pamuk manages to convey that obsession without making the novel entirely unreadable, although there are long passages that convey just how tedious irrational passion can be for those who are not directly involved. What is most interesting how Turkey's traditional society grapples with modernity in terms of family and gender roles, education, and commerce, including the development of a film industry. In the background is the political turbulence of the era, with Marxists and an army that takes control in coup during the period covered by the novel. Fusun, unfortunately, is not as interesting; she is in many ways the least compelling woman in a book that should be wholly hers. She stamps her feet, smokes, is impatient, and is in general, described behaves in physical terms--Kemal dwells on her beauty almost exclusively. Perhaps in that the reader is a victim of the narrative choice, since the hopelessly enamored Kemal is, aside from some modernist tricks toward the end of the novel, the exclusive narrator and we see only as much of her as he cares to realte. There are other women in the novel who are in many ways more interesting--both Kemal's mother and Fusun's, and the college-educated Sibel, whom Kemal spurns to pursue the object of his obsession. That Kemal is so unobservant--while all the time professing to be an obsessive observer--keeps Fusun from being fully alive, perhaps one more way in which she is trapped and betrayed not only by society and family but by the man who professes at such length to be her deepest admirer.","Jun 10, 2015"
3687216,Yelda Basar Moers,"Rumi said love is love; it is obsession, longing, warmth, care, erotic, platonic; it’s all the same. Love is love. And I believe that is the theme and message that is resonating through this book! It makes you think about the expanse and boundaries of love and that perhaps obsession is a part of it? Nobel Prize-winning Turkish author Orhan Pamuk takes us through the intense Proust-like pondering of his protagonist Kemal in his longing and love for Fusun, a young shopgirl who is his distant relative. I don’t want to give details of the plot away as it will be a spoiler, but I can say that this is worth the read (I just recently finished it). The Museum of Innocence is a tragic love story and much is lost, but the remnants and relics of love can never be lost as Pamuk shows us.. Set in Istanbul in the 1970's, this book takes us through many parts of the city that were actually quite familiar to me as my father grew up in the neighborhood of Nisantasi (a main setting of this book). My grandparents lived in the same apartment until they passed away. As a child, I would visit them in this Tesvikiye apartment, not too far from where Orhan Pamuk grew up and where this story is set. My father who is very close in age to Pamuk is convinced that they must have gone to the same primary school and later traveled in similar circles. Like the characters in this story, my parents were also very much living privileged Western lives in 1970's Istanbul in the same neighborhoods divorced very much from the rest of the country.. Though Istanbul is a main character of this book, and Pamuk's classic motif of the East West clash is very much alive, this is a book about love and obsession. Pamuk delves deeply into this subject and I think he does a brilliant job. In the end, though, this type of love never ends well, in life and in literature.. ""Wasn't it strange, I asked, that his life had fallen prey to such a black passion. But if I had ever met Fusun, Cetin Efendi explained, I would have understood why Kemal Bey had fallen so hard for this woman. They-- Fusun and Kemal-- were essentially good and innocent souls who suited each other perfectly, but as God had been unwilling to let them be together, we mortals were in no position to question the outcome too closely.""","May 19, 2019"
219006,Nitya,"I ploughed my way through most of this book. In the middle, it really slowed down. But the last 100 pages sucked me in and made the whole book worth it.. I never felt any empathy for the central characters Kemal and Fusun. I thought he was too obsessive - a personality that would fix on anything or anyone to be obsessed by, irrespective of their personal qualities. I didnt get Fusun - she seemed to be very blurred. I could visualise her well, but not her personality and character. Towards teh end, I saw the bitterness and the slight meanness that had crept into her. But, it was in the end, the scenes before the climax and third person descriptions of Kemal and Fusun that brought them home so much more. I finally felt and saw their innocence, their hopefulness. I had to flip through the pages once again. And suddenly, Kemal's foolishness in throwing away all he had without taking a firm stand became innocence, naivete, an inability to scheme or plan or be practical.. Being a cynic (especially about love) made it hard for me to stomach this obsessive love at first. But, now... thinking of the book leaves a quiet smile behind.","May 20, 2010"
28134808,Nabilah Firdaus,"Actual rating: 3.4/5 stars for The Museum of Innocence by Orhan Pamuk. The Museum of Innocence (TMOI) is a story of love and obsession of Kemal, a bourgeoisie, who fell in love with Fusun, a beautiful shopgirl in Istanbul when Kemal and his girlfriend were about to be engaged.. TMOI has a quite straightforward & simple storyline, really. The earlier parts were entertaining but it became tedious because of the draggy and unnecessary (atleast, for me) descriptions of atmospheres in Istanbul and Kemal's obsessions. It was beautiful at points, even powerful - but 500+ pages of it -and with such ending (even though it had me in tears) - I'm slightly disappointed.. However, I'm very much intrigued by Pamuk's writing style and this wont certainly be my last book from him! (And the Museum of Innocence is real, go google!)","Mar 11, 2017"
11926525,Linh,"i waited for almost one week(or so i guess lol) to write down what i felt after reading this piece of novel.. ""The Museum of Innocence"" is sometimes considered another "" Love in the time of Cholera"" as they both depict such persistence and infinity of love despite time and space. Both Kemal Bey and Florentin both withhold love for ""the one"" of their life, though in two different ways.. Kemal bey knew deep in his heart that he and Fusun were made for one another. Although she is married, he sensed, just his intuition that she did not love her husband and later found out many years later, they are just friends living under the same roof. Such a determination ,consistency and above all, love he had for Fusun that he paid visit to Fusun house every single day for a consecutive 8 years. 8 years of a person's life. he could have had a loving family of his own, with his used-to-be finacee, Sibel, had children and lived such a peaceful life.. i sometimes wonder why did he not choose that road, it would be so easy and yes, straightforward it must have been if he could just follow the path laid down for him from the start. why followed the unexpected and tortured himself. he wanted to find happiness, everybody does! it just depends on the path they chose. Kemel took the rough path and finished it. at the very least, he could live with the one he truly loved even just through the objects representing his loved one's soul in them. He fell happy in the end, that that is what mattered most.. ""Happiness is not a destination, it is a journey"" how true this sentence can be. 8 years of accumulated happiness with a pinch of hardship, a little bit of sourness of life and that is just plain ""imperfectly beautiful"" .. My favorite chapter must be ""Time"" and ""In another life"".. ""it must have been then i first came to realize that for most people life was not a joy to be embraced with a full heart but a miserable charade to be endured with a false smile, a narrow path life, punishments and repression."". ""clocks and calendars do not exist to remind us of the TIME we have forgotten but to regulate our relations with other and indeed all of society.When looking at the black and white clock that appeared on the screen every evening,just before the news, it was not Time we remembered but other families, other people, and the clocks that regulated our business with them."".

900147,Laura,"This is a story of a love triangle involving Kemal - son of a wealthy Turkish family, his fiancee Sibel - daughter of another rich family and Füsun, a young shopgirl by who Kemal is obsessively attracted to.. By telling the story of these three young people, the author describes the behavior of Istanbul bourgeoisie in the 1970s.. Once Kemal breaks their marriage engagement, Sibel decides to move on and marries another man. Kemal and Sibel will only re-encounter each other 31 years later.. Throughout his obsession and fantasy, Kemal starts to collect small Füsun’s personal objects in order to remind him of the great moments of love shared with Füsun. On the other hand, his beloved decides to marry a future film maker instead of saying with Kemal.. When Kemal’s life turns upside down (no spoilers here), he decides to build “the museum of innocence” which gives the tittle to this book..

42499758,Mark Joyce,"50-100 pages into this book I was seriously debating whether to continue reading. Had I not been going on a trip to Istanbul the following week and keen to read something set in that city I probably would have dropped it. A week after finishing, I can’t stop thinking about it and would unhesitatingly list The Museum of Innocence among the ten most memorable and distinctive novels I’ve ever read. There were three big turning points along the way:. First, the penny dropping that not only is Kemal not quite everything he purports to be but is a pathologically unreliable narrator. And I mean unreliable to the Kazuo Ishiguro-esque extent that I found myself revisiting numerous seemingly straightforward episodes from early in the book and questioning whether they really happened that way at all. A creepy and disorienting sensation that is one of my favourite things in literature. Also like Ishiguro, there are three or four absolutely killer sentences deployed at key moments on which the whole book (in my view) hinges.. Second (and connected to the first), the realisation that the hero of this novel is not Kemal at all but rather Fusun, the object of his infatuated attentions. The book’s multiple deeper layers relating to class, gender relations, the nature of modern Turkey and the meaning of love, happiness and success all follow from this (discuss).. Third, visiting the actual Museum of Innocence in Istanbul. This afforded the opportunity physically to enter the world evoked in the book, but in such a way that the reader could still hold onto their own mental image of the key characters (who are not depicted in the museum but whose off-stage presence is almost palpable). I’m not aware of anywhere else quite like this in the world and it helped to cement a unique reading experience.. This was my first Orhan Pamuk novel but I can immediately see why he was considered worthy of the Nobel Prize (despite this having been written after he won it). This is really top drawer stuff: a distinctive, confident authorial voice; originality; subtle, completely believable characterisation; a strong sense of a particular place and time combined with universal themes - all the hallmarks, in other words, of the very best that fiction can offer.","Feb 09, 2019"
6804318,Alan Newman,"I have read a lot of Pamuk: My name is Red, Snow, White Castle, Istanbul. He writes in Istanbul of a special melancholy that the city imparts to its inhabitants, and this certainly permeates his work. Moreover, there is a claustrophobic, obsessive feel to his books--his characters are trapped in their own obsessions. I felt I had escaped from the book when I finished Snow, and that sense of airlessness and entrapment is even more pronounced in the Museum of Innocence--a book I YEARNED to escape from, though managed to finish. Though the social issues of premarital sex and the cult of virginity in Turkish Society of the 1970's was interesting, this telling of an obsessive relationship between a wealthy Turk and his less well off cousin eventually just made me angry. I wanted to shout at the guy--get a life! Leave her alone! Grow up! Who Cares? He would not have heard me or listened if I could have done so.. In the end, this is a creepy and tedious book, despite Pamuk's obvious talent, and the social issues raised. He has actually just opened a Museum of Innocence in an Istanbul apartment--to commemorate memories of a City that is losing its character. So be it. This is a perfect book for stalkers, petty thieves--it wasnt for me.","Aug 03, 2012"

It is a novel that makes this part of the Orient approachable to the run -of- the -mill of European and American readers. For the Museum of innocence is also set on that path and in doing so has rendered Turkey and its population to the eyes of the avid and the curious of this age, strenghthened by easy information of TV, I say TV because O. Pamuk describes this life , and from one point only through those upper classes , and those impoverished middle classes who have beeen struggling to live as modern country in a way their father and protector of the nation decreeted : Turkey has to be moden and progressive nation, religion has to be put aside from state affairs and religios authorites can't interfere in the countries affairs. But by taking away religion , one cannot reform minds of people, one cannot teach them to act in the true spirit of of individual life and the exact norms due to the community and the state It is a long process and a difficult one that even long western democracies have felt all the difficulies especially at times of great strains, depresions, recessions, wars, disparition of Eastern block, The Berlin's wall and all the problems of independence in the Balkans. Religion has something to do with history and every day life, and of inner link of the run of the mill. , it is a sort of inner life and which is in mind's habits, customs of thinking of being oneself , connecting people to others , family and community. It is a process of being true and balanced human being conscious of the difference It iy about loving and existing at the crossroads of history events and staying true to the best of tradition nan accepting modern life as such.. You can think about this novel as a cultural phenomenon, obviously metaphores are easy, ready to understand and accept, made to move, to appeal to modern reader, you can't judge it literarily. The author takes to heart Turkey and its problems. The book is a trend in modern times as if to educate masses, to tell them about thenselves and their history, their past.. The novel is good, written interestingly having for its aim ordinary readers and wide majority of population. He is intelligent, educared , know the process of time ad theory of genre and narratives . Has read Aristotle. And also what can do the question of Time , on any soul, on his fellows citizens' and on the creatve soul, Nerval and Proust are known to him too . He put them diluted for a reader who is busy , wanting information about his time in our last century and its very end , those unglorious times of troubles that put a strain on the family about our generations, older and youger, love, free love and sex with young among young men and young womes and how they go free but at the same time try to survive, how they are Turkish but at the same time modern, as trheir Father wanted them. Not so without disasters, major minor on all levels and strata of society.. The Museum of Innocence is a novel about difficulties of growing up , about its major and minor consequences not always dignified and mature but still they are parts of one's life and one has to accept them and accept his or her life and and stick to it And the counties,too , have to accept their mistakes and infelicities and proceed by willing to them to improvements if they want to be a true good states but above all it teaches how to remain true self and preserve their learning process in the memory of inocence memories and keep them for future generations. And for all The novel without this explanation will rate badly but for this in mind I give 4 stars for his courage making things known , of appoaching it to people in the form of reachable narratives how it is difficult to stay a responsible man anda woman and not to be ashamed of their acts. , not to be ashamed of their life. For talking and making it known will help them accept and love the very imprefections of their past behaviour. The novel will barely be read or be frustrating if this reading does not apply. But wait 5 stars is too much Because I reserve 5 stars with mz favourite writers who are so difficult and complex , that each sentence is subject to nuances. 4 stars for a sort of good story of a popular writer, concerned with his and his country's experience of the tradition and the past, will do. So 4 stars just for a popular genre , for those eager to explore the effects on modernity from the angle of an emotionally charged It is a book about love, a feeling that demands grandeur and maturity, but not present in a mature way but still the narrator has learnt how to save it as an experience to memory. tradition of the past","Feb 17, 2020"
4656570,Jalilah,"My book ratings are based according to how much I enjoy them. 5 stars is reserved for the ones that I love so much that I don't feel like leaving their world once I've finished. I am aware that The Museum of Innocence is a great literary work. However it gets only 3 stars from me because many parts were really not enjoyable. In fact, a couple of times I considered ditching the book all together. It's clear to me this is not supposed to be a ""fun book"" that makes you feel good. It follows the tradition of classic literature on obsession and people's downfalls as a result of it.. Here is the synopsis from Amazon:. ""It is 1975, a perfect spring in Istanbul. Kemal and Sibel, children of two prominent families, are about to become engaged. But when Kemal encounters Füsun, a beautiful shopgirl and a distant relation, he becomes enthralled. And once they violate the code of virginity, a rift begins to open between Kemal and the world of the Westernized Istanbul bourgeoisie. In his pursuit of Füsun over the next eight years, Kemal becomes a compulsive collector of objects that chronicle his lovelorn progress—amassing a museum that is both a map of a society and of his heart."". There really is a museum! Orhan Pamuk created it after he wrote book:. http://www.masumiyetmuzesi.org/?Langu.... .. There definitely are things I liked; the descriptions of Istanbul in the 1970s, the inside view of the very wealthy Westernized Turks and the way Pamuk contrasts them with middle and lower class families. I also like the fact that he tackles the issue of virginity and the double standards surrounding it.. In the beginning the story of how Kemal meets Füsun and the two having a secret love affair is enthralling. Kemel, who I found absolutely exasperating, is still engaged with Sorbonne educated Sibel and believes that he can keep both women. He actually invites Füsun to his engagement party and is then devastated when Füsun disappears and does not want to see him any more! He falls into a depression where all he can do is keep going back to the apartment where they met and smell everything Füsun has touched! This is the first part that really dragged on and on!. When Kemal finally finds Füsun again the story starts to get interesting. She has been married off to a distant relative and is still living with her parents. Her husband is an aspiring filmmaker. Kemal has the idea to help co-produce a film in which Füsun will star as a way of remaining close to her. The insights into the Turkish film industry were fascinating. Kemal then goes on to visit the family every night for the next 8 years and here is when it starts to get really tedious.. It's also creepy and twisted because in this time Kemal begins stealing objects in the house belonging to Füsun going home and smelling them! All these objects will later on end up in his Museum including Füsuns' cigarette butts and hair pins!. Then there is an unexpected twist giving the reader hope, only to disappoint again!. I ended up hating Kemal! I feel like he destroyed Füsuns' life and that she is the real victim in the story. She really wants to be an actress, but in the society she lives in she can not just simply go out on her own. Kemal in his obsession deceives her regarding this.. Orhan Pamuk is clearly influenced by many of the classic authors. I also love reading the classics, but the two authors who seemed to have influenced this book the most are two that I can not get into at all; Marcel Proust and Naboukov!","Feb 25, 2014"
2385526,Azarin,"The Museum of Innocence - in my opinion - is not Orhan Pamuk's best work, but it is still an amazing novel.. I have just finished reading it and I am - again - blown away by Pamuk's genius and his ability to grasp and to hold my attention for the whole length of 530 pages of the novel. Plus, I feel a bit melancholic, leaving his extraordinary but fictional world, made of the same ingredients: a man`s quest to find love, his life's gradual but drastic change, and this endless pursuit of happiness...while erring in the streets of Istanbul.. The novel started as a love story doomed to fail. But as the time passes (the novel covers more than 32 years) and the obsessive nature of Kemal's mind is revealed, I began to wonder if this love would have ever sustained if these two people had actually gotten married. Since, besides all these objects, gathered and cherishes by Kemal - objects which have been used or possessed by Fusun and her family - does he ever try to understand Fusun's mind, her thoughts, her wants or her dreams. He appears mostly surprised at most of Fusun's responses to him. He gives up his previous life, in the name of his love for a woman, while it is clear that he's only in love with her beauty. Almost as if he is under a maledict spell, he doesn't understand her sadness, or her sorrow. After having spent 8 years at her dinner table, I'm not sure if he still could interpret her gestures, her few words, or her silences in the right way? Besides watching TV together, while she remained in her own bitterness and he lingered at the depth of his own impossible obsession, what else did they share?. The more I read, the more I felt that their love story could have had a different path if Kemal wasn't so much in love with the image of a woman he had made in his mind. He wasn't really in love with Fusun, but in love with his own fascination, or in other sense, in love with this obsession.. But before I could develop a stronger resentment toward Kemal for his ignorance and selfishness, Pamuk wrote:""Sometimes it occurred to me that ours (our love) was a companionship of knowing shared defeat: This made me even happier than love did."". And there, I realized that all along the way, this was the story Pamuk intended to tell. In other words, Fusun's love represents this obsession with the past, this timeless nostalgia, while the character of Sibel represents the modernity. No wonder Fusun's realm ends up in a museum, or as Pamuk writes: ""...if objects that bring us shame are displayed in a museum, they are immediately transformed into possessions in which to take pride."". The Museum of Innocence is a complex novel, beautifully written, full of intriguing and thought provoking twists and turns, and I would definitely recommend it to every book lover.","Mar 06, 2010"
762708,Rose Margaret Deniz,"Once in awhile there's a book I haven't particularly enjoyed reading, but that has left a lasting impression, and The Museum of Innocence is one of them (. Ahab's Wife: Or, The Star-gazer: A Novel. ,. The Corrections. ,. The Name of the Rose: Including Postscript. , as other examples). I've discovered something about my reading habits while reading this book, too, that I will stay with a book even when I tire of it if there is some kind of alchemy that happens, some elixir or intangible element that exists beyond the book's style. The Museum of Innocence was essential reading for me, though I nearly did not finish it having struggled to get through. My Name Is Red. a few years back without success. In the meantime, I read Pamuk's book of essays,. Istanbul: Memories and the City. , and because of that book, The Museum of Innocence became much more vivid. I would recommend Istanbul: Memories and the City very highly.. I adore Pamuk's use of his doppelgänger though I'm sure that will make some people annoyed, and having watched many classic Yeşilcam Turkish films on Sunday afternoons, I can appreciate the cinematic nature of the book. What I really wanted to do at various points was edit the distracting sentence length of Pamuk's prose. When I got beyond this obviously intentional style, I could enjoy the story instead of paying attention to the pauses. The best part of reading this book was calling my sister-in-law in Istanbul and crying on the phone when I finished the book. And then discussing which characters we hated.","Jan 22, 2010"
808994,Doug Bradshaw,"I asked people for a good audio book recommendation that I could listen to while on my treadmill. So I read it/listened to it in many 45 to 55 minute workout sessions. It's one of those books that you need to rate in many categories. The reading and translation of the book were a total five. I was surprised how easily I followed every nuance of the story and looked forward to getting on my stairclimber for the next session. I give it an overall 4, because it seemed sometimes to go over and over the same material too much and too often to the point of obsession. Here are different ways to look at this book:. 1. It is a story of an intelligent, obsessive compulsive spoiled man, who ruins his life by obsessing over a girl who may not even love him very much.. 2. It is the story of true love and the power of the chemistry one can have with his or her soulmate, willing to give up everything for the tiniest morsel of affection.. 3. It is the story of a mentally ill individual who has money and power and ruins the life of a young beautiful girl.. 4. It is the story of why museums are set up all over the world to honor people who have been loved and admired by others.. 5. It is a historical novel about life in Turkey from about 1975 to 1985, how the wealthy live, the government rules and the normal people go about their lives.. But all of that said, I have to admit that I was very affected by Kemal's love for Fussan and the beautifully descriptive language put together to portray that extreme love that eventually ends with an early death. It is a well told very professionally written story, and it was perfect for something to listen to while trudging through a lot of hours on the treadmill","May 01, 2010"
92840710,Rose,"As its blurb says, this book is highly admired by The Washington Post and some others. It didn't attract me though! Finishing it was really a tough work cause it was tedious for me especially in the middle. Yet the aristocrat society of Turkey trapped in somewhere between modernity and tradition was interesting for me. Trying to behave like Europeans on one hand and not being able to get rid of gossips and spreading rumours on the other hand was paradoxical, and the writer describes it well. The idea of Museum of innocence was intersting as well. I really eager to visit it one day!","Feb 25, 2019"
41359514,Megha Chakraborty,"Orhan Pamuk has his own way of taking his reader to another world, and he successfully did the same with, The Museum of Innocence. The novel starts with the cliche, Man falls in love with a woman, who he knows is unattainable, omitting the fact that he is already engaged to another woman. A very common Love Triangle, of course, story, to be honest, is a little predictable. A little self-indulgent at times but urged up the feeling of oppression and frustration of the Istanbul of the time - torn between Western and traditional Turkish culture. That is what stands out in the entire novel, the setting, Turkish culture, the narrow streets, food, music, family dynamics, all this paints a lovely picture of Istanbul, which makes you come back to the book.. If you are into happy endings, this is not the book for you, it's about an obsessive lover, a lover who notices every big little change in their lover's behavior, collect their things, their cigarette butt.. Pamuk, describes all his characters so well, gives them all a personality and an identifiable characteristic.. Ill highly recommend this book, it's one of a kind. Exceptional.","Jun 23, 2020"
3558148,Bob Pearson,"""An astonishing achievement"" says one review. Orhan Pamuk's ""greatest achievement"" says the book cover. Maybe. It could also be the narcissistic intellectual extravagance of someone who's won a Nobel Prize for Literature. If you seriously start into this book, you'll wonder how many editors died for Pamuk's sins to get it published. But if you do indeed stay with it, its compelling attraction pulls you unforgivingly through the book despite yourself. As his hopeless, feckless hero follows the trail of his obsessive love without regard to the lives he's ruining, he also progressively rationalizes a justification for his own wasted life and the unhappiness he visits on countless others (and himself). With his unflinchingly honest style, Pamuk makes you endure the same pain as his hero and the many victims of his hero's squandered years. Along the way, Pamuk takes a surgeon's scalpel to Turkish (Istanbul) high society during the 1950's, writes himself into the story, and takes us (to the great interest of those who know Turkey) through the physical and cultural geography of Istanbul. He leads us through a fascinating study of why people collect things and what museums signify. In the end, the hero sits in a monument to his own ruin and degradation. What is amazing is that Pamuk almost makes you accept that it was all worth it for the hero because of the enormity of the sacrifice and the magnitude of the obsession. I'll remember this book for a long time, but I still cannot say exactly why or whether that's a good thing. Hence 3 stars for a book that either was a vessel for egotistical word crafting or a book that faces up to profound and rarely examined perspectives.","Jun 06, 2010"
305737,Tanja,"I started this book with high expectations. I had read 'Snow', and 'The Black Book' and really enjoyed the two books. But in this one, I believe Pamuk faltered. The story did not grab me, the characters' fate did not touch me, and this time his style of writing felt laborious and oftentimes simply boring. It cannot just be a translation issue (I read the first two books in German, and this one in its English translation), but the real problem lies with the story; this protracted, deeply unsatisfying and unhappy story. And yes, I realize that Kemal -- the central character -- believes himself to have led a happy life, but misery just seemed to pore out of every sentence. This is less a story of love and innocence, and more a story of obsession and drifting, of guilt and responsibility denied. The story seemed to drag on and on, and by the time a version of the author makes an appearance (at an engagement party, and later on to write Kemal and Fuesun's story) it was all over for me. I am afraid I cannot recommend this book.","Jan 28, 2010"

How much pining for a woman can a man do? She may have been beautiful but visiting her aunts house just to see her for 8 years until she finally relented and divorced her husband for him.

41578933,Pechi,"The Museum of innocence, ostensibly said to be about love, is actually an endless-seeming exploration of obsession and lust. It brings to mind various books: Folding Star by Alan Hollinghurst where a thirty-something is sexually obsessed with a teenager, and goes on and on about his ""unrequited love""; Death in Venice by Thomas Mann that deals with love along similar lines; Remainder by Tom McCarthy in which a new millionaire squanders his wealth to reconstruct vaguely remembered scenes ad infinitum to satisfy an obscure psychological obsession.. Unlike the guy in Remainder, Kemal, our protagonist who assembles the titular museum, has a clear purpose. And that is to win over a teenager (Fusun) with whom he began an affair merely a month before his engagement to a richer match (Sibel). He goes ahead with the engagement, euphoric about having found an ideal wife (patient, womanly, older) and an ideal mistress (exciting, young, energetic) so early in his life. Reality diverges from his plans when his mistress catches him in one of his lies, and his life goes to a toss as she cuts him off completely. He goes through a period of darkness and breaks up with Sibel before being invited to Fusun's house a year later. The worst invited guest in the history of universe, he spends the next 8 - EIGHT! - years visiting her house for dinner trying to annoy her into a relationship.. Nothing much happens in the 700 or so pages, but the book remains pretty engaging. Kemal admitting to his own privilege and his consciousness about being rich in a poor country make the proceedings more tolerable. The book is suffused with the history of 70s Istanbul and descriptions of lives of the wealthy Turkish elite. I'm getting increasingly curious about visiting Istanbul after reading so many books about Turkey. The city where East meets West is also a source of great identity crisis for the characters. I loved seeing the characters engaged in a tug of war between staying true to their Oriental origins and being tempted by Occidental pleasures. In this age where mindlessly imitating the West is seen as progress and everything else is deemed inferior, anyone born outside the West is bound to experience this dilemma. This dilemma seems to be particularly pronounced in Turkish novels, their geography deepening the inevitable dilemma.. The first fifty pages of the book were magical. I was completely enraptured. But as Kemal was separated from Fusun, I was separated from this rapture and tedium set in. Did Pamuk go on and on to emphasize the agony of Kemal's wait? Maybe. I would've preferred if Fusun's perspective alternated with Kemal's. Anyhoo. This book's good enough, if overrated. Recommended for those with a lot of time to kill/those eager to relive their unrequited loves/those obsessed with the needlessly narcissistic Pamuk/those looking for wrongest examples of relationships.","Dec 31, 2019"
7321024,Rositsa Zlatilova,"The Museum of Innocence. is Orhan Pamuk at his very best.. The book starts with what the narrator calls. “the happiest moment of my life”. and is set in Istanbul in the 1970s – the time when the city grew massively in population and opened to the West.. At the edge of his engagement party to the Sorbonne graduate and sophisticated Sibel, the 30-year old newly rich and idle Kemal falls in love with the 18-year old and his distant cousin Füsun, a beautiful shop assistant with ambitions of a fuller life.. Kemal and Füsun start meeting in the shabby Mehmet Apartments, a place which Kemal’s mother uses as a storehouse for items she got rid of. Unable to develop a meaningful relationship with his fiancée Sibel or win back the trust of his beloved Füsun, Kemal begins saving mementos of Füsun that comprise what he calls the Museum of Innocence as an attempt it will evoke her presence.. The objects in the Mehmet Apartments also refer to the lost world of Istanbul in the 1970s. The Beyoğlu restaurants, the foghorns, the fishermen on the Bosphorus, the street sellers, Eid, the muddy, cobblestone streets of Istanbul, the old posters on movie theater windows, and the items Kemal gathers from collectors as if to preserve the time he spent with Füsun. The city between two continents also reflects Kemal’s inner conflict – Füsun is the nostalgia and the world that is forever gone, and Sibel is the modern and rapidly changing Istanbul.. “Real museums are places where Time is transformed into Space,”. says Kemal, after he, as it seems, has lost everything, and refers to Aristotle’s distinction between time (a line that connects all moments in the present) and single moments of the present, and suggests that we should stop thinking about a linear conception of experience:. “sometimes these moments we call the “present” can bring us enough happiness to last a century, as they did if Füsun smiled.”. At the same time, however, the catalog of gathered items does not overwhelm the very real sense that all is. “far in the past, that it will never return,”. and Kemal makes a further observation:. “Sometimes it occurred to me that ours (our love) was a companionship of knowing shared defeat: This made me even happier than love did.”. Along with love, nostalgia and Istanbul, another big topic explored in the novel is the changing-non-changing Turkish society. Pamuk depicts the unwritten rules applying to Turkish men and women, young and old, the relationships in the upper Turkish class and the importance of women’s virginity before marriage.. “I was driven by the very question that lay at the heart of what it meant to be a man or a woman in our part of the world,”. Kemal tells the reader remembering Füsun, and also adds:. “In Europe the rich are refined enough to act as if they’re not wealthy. That is how civilized people behave. If you ask me, being cultured and civilized is not about everyone being free and equal; it’s about everyone being refined enough to act as if they were. Then no one has to feel guilty.”. The novel’s structure is another compelling experience. Only towards the end of the book, the reader realizes that the story has been written not by Kemal but by Orhan Pamuk, whom Kemal hired to write down the story and whom he eventually asked:. “So tell me, have you ever been in love this way, Orhan Bey?”. “Hmmmmm . . . We aren't talking about me,” he said, and he fell silent.”. But of course he has. There's no way you could convey it this way without having experienced it. And for that experience we are all richer.”. The title is a dynamic thing in itself too. It is a collective representation of everything discussed in the book – longing, devotion, loss, time, nostalgia, praise, pride, taboos, stigmas, and above all love.. Beyond the misfortunes in Kemal’s life, the prevailing message in. The Museum of Innocence. is incarnated in Kemal’s request to the storyteller Orhan Pamuk:. “Let everyone know, I lived a very happy life.”. This is declared by the same Kemal who once used to be in the cream of the crop of the Turkish upper society, but who later, because of his choices, slowly became disorientated in the eyes of his extended family and friends. To all of them, however, he has something to tell, in his certain and determined manner:. “If we give what we treasure most to a Being we love with all our hearts, if we can do that without expecting anything in return, then the world becomes a beautiful place”.. The Museum of Innocence. is Orhan Pamuk at his very, very best.","Apr 07, 2017"
4693,Ali,"A long and detailed account of the obsessive love that Kemal, a wealthy businessman, bears for Füsun, a lower class girl, relatively poor, 12 years younger than him. His selfishness refuses to give up his fiancée (Sibel), to be with his love (Füsun), but becomes an obsessive collector of the objects of his short being with Füsun, a bizarre situation as Kemal objectifies Füsun, satisfying his emotional obsession. He can not / would not treat her as a human being rather than a thing.. So, from one side, “The Museum of Innocence” is a love story, as length as a century, brimful of unnecessary details … monotony with repetitious phrases such as all of her beautiful being, “her sad eyes, her miraculous lips, her large pink tongue, her velvet cheeks, her shapely shoulders, the silky skin of her throat, chest, neck, and belly, her long legs, her delicate feet, the sight of which had always made me smile, her slender honey-hued arms” (God knows how many times in different chapters) … or long chapters like The Engagement Party… (there were times when I read it joylessly).. On the other side, “The Museum of Innocence” is the story of Turkey-Istanbul society’s long and tiring journey, from traditional time to modernity; from a religious medieval society to kind of shallow European modernity, a dispute between two generations; parents trying to keep what exists, living in a nostalgic life, sighing for missing old music, old way of gathering, old architecture, old way of life and living, and children who imitate and follow the manifestations of modernity (new café’s, modern restaurants, free sexual relationship…) but deeply captured in their traditional culture and beliefs (e.g. virginity of girls)… It is an old city, so old that in 1975, when novel begins, Istanbul, remained of Ottoman Empire, while Kemal, Fusun and Athaturk’s Turkey are young, the family still own a 1956 Chevrolet. Everything goes slowly as Kemal says in one of last chapters; “Time had favored us both with growth of wisdom, and of depth, it pleased me to see…” and Istanbul-Turkey is changed, somehow to a modern European style! The museum objects sustains notes of elegy and nostalgia, post-imperial capital. ""that familiar Istanbul smell of sea and moss, pigeon droppings, coal smoke, car exhaust and linden blossoms""..

4554994,Tanuj Solanki,"The review till now ->>. One has to begin with 'Love in the time of Cholera'. Marquez's novel on obsessive love has to be compared with Pamuk's novel. But perhaps such a comparison is to be done precisely to show the astounding difference between the two novels.. The protagonists of both novels - Marquez's Florentino Ariza and Pamuk's Kemal Basmaci - are obsessive about their love interests, with an obsession that finds it absolutely necessary to calibrate itself. So we have Florentino - keeping a sharp count of his days of unrequited love for Fermina Daza, the count remaining precise even after 53 years (it is, in fact, not Florentino but the narrator who keeps the count, but this shift in perspective is not important at this point); and venturing into 622 sexual relationships in those 53 odd years (some of these adventures get more than adequate space in the novel.) Kemal too keeps a similarly strindent count of his 10 or more years of separation with Fusun. In contrast with Florentino, Kemal remains chaste in all these years, an imposed chastity which is perhaps meant to mirror the imaginary chastitiy of Turkish folk of that day and age, just as Florentino's promiscuity may have been meant to mirror the imaginary promiscuity of Caribbean folk. But it is beyond this, beyond this surficial comparison, that Kemal provides us with an amount of obession poring through which is in itself a daunting task. Because in his case the delusion of calibrating the obsession gashes far far deeper - there are 4100+ collected cigarette butts, there are 44 days of erotic pleasures with Fusun, 1500 or so visits to the Keskin (Fusun's) household, a count of the number of Turkish movies watched together, innumerable number of objects stolen from the Keskin household, a count of the number of visits to restaurants by the Bosphorus...","Jul 23, 2012"

A novel about obsession that can be easily compared to Nabokov’s Lolita, only this one is written in a better way!. As usual, Istanbul is one of the main characters in this book; this time adding a romantic ambiance to the setting of the story!. The feelings in this book are tremendous; his love, passion and breakdown are all very true and vivid that you can feel them too. The characters are amazingly built that it is very easy to sympathize with them!. Kemal and Fusun should be literary symbols of love just like majnun and layla, and others who tell stories of love and turmoil!. A book of feelings and very detailed and poetic descriptions!.

87308762,Rabiraj Banerjee,""" My last words in the book are these Orhan Bey please don't forget them....."". ""I won't"". ""Let everyone know, I lived a happy life"". Thus with these closing lines the book comes to an end. I will be eternally grateful that I did not give up on this book. Yes, there were times when the narrator's(Kemal) obsession with Fusun especially after her departure from his engagement party was getting the better of me. But deep down this is not just a simple love story. No!! with this novel Mr.Pamuk has drawn a picture of Istanbul's conflict with the contradictory ideals of East and the West. The conflicts that a woman faced in Istanbul society- which had a lot of rigid attitudes towards virginity, pre-marital sex,class distinction and western ideals- and the impending modernism which was slowly getting enmeshed in the society. It is in this turbulent times that narrator falls in love with Fusun- 12 years his junior - and even though he is already engaged to his lady love Sibel-who is of his own societal station. What follows is copious details of how he and Fusun secretly met at his apartment in Merhemet and made love, and it is through these regular carnal meetings that Kemal finally falls in love with Fusun. But his bourgeoisie life crumbles once Fusun without any notice stops contacting him after his engagement with Sibel. What follows is a long narrative where the narrator goes into copious details of his obsession, love and Time which might need great strength on the part of the reader to discern and continue with the novel. But he knows happiness once he is reunited with Fusun again, but all of this comes to a sad end. Taking inspiration from his visits to various museums across the world he is met with an epiphany of building his own museum where every object he has collected throughout his life, objects that reminded him of Fusun, must be preserved in a museum which he names ""The Museum of Innocence"".. Should you read this book?. Obviously yes!! it will test your patience, but no great work of art was ever created without patience. Read it for the definitions of happiness, about snatching each and every minute even to be with someone you love, or something you love. In this world of fierce competition and identity crisis that each one of us face, it is better to be happy by being true to yourself even though the world might think you crazy. Another thought which deeply entrenched in the book. I will reread it once I am a bit older to understand some philosophy which my young mind has not been able to comprehend now.","Dec 22, 2018"

4661206,Tom Ireland,"Last night in the wee hours I finished my latest book, Orhan Pamuk's The Museum of Innocence. In retrospect, when you are trying to blog with some degree of regularity, a book of more than seven hundred pages was never a wise move. But when every one of those pages seems specifically designed to drag the story out like a miser's butter, you are in trouble.. I rarely read contemporary novels, reasoning that if they are really worth reading now, they will still be worth reading in a couple of decades. Pamuk has reminded me why. At this point I would like to stop and say that I am not saying to anyone that they should not read this book. It is a masterpiece of craftsmanship and I can see why many have praised it so highly. It is simply that I did not get on with it.. The book tells the (long) tale of a rich man who falls in love with a poor girl. Things do not exactly go their way and his love turns to obsession as he collects things belonging to the girl to build the eponymous museum. That is a rather rough precis, the storyline is a little more complicated and the main character, Kemal, is a little less stalkerish than it suggests.. I have no problem with the plot or the writing. The plot is robust and the writing is genuinely magnificent. My main problem is that I would have been happy to read the story in three to four hundred pages. Of course many people will disagree with me there as the length is a major part of the story itself.. It is the way in which it is done that grinds my gears. Pamuk seems to be toying with the reader just for the sake of it and not to enrich the novel. As I read a very long section in which Kemal moped around I would begin to contemplate giving up. Just as I was on the point of doing so, the novel would change tack. On one page I wrote 'frustratingly passive', two pages later I was obliged to write 'I take it back'. I do not like to feel I am an author's plaything.. ""Knowing that visitors to my museum must by now be sick and tired of my heartache..."". Pamuk writes at one point. At another:. ""Clever readers will have sensed that I have placed this anthropology lesson here to allow myself a chance to cool off from the jealousy that Fusun's love stories provoked"". Except what he is saying is 'but I am cleverer, I knew what you would think'.. This sort of toying for its own sake always winds me up. The Museum of Innocence reminded me of Ian McEwan's Atonement, another (contemporary) novel I did not get on with and in which the writer seems to be playing around with the narrative just because he can. As with McEwan's book, we are left with the final revelation that the main narrative has in fact been written by its main character. This sort of postmodern flourish does nothing for me. It is very trite to say 'This is what happened...' before unveiling your unreliable narrator in an Eastenders drumroll '...or is it?!' moment. I smelt a rat as soon as Orhan Pamuk, writer and distant relation to Kemal, was introduced as a member of the supporting cast.. This feeling that the writer is in vice-like control of the story is anathema to what I feel literature should be. Literature should sweep us away when we read it and the same should happen to the author as they write.","Dec 14, 2010"
2843912,switterbug (Betsey),"The main character that emerges from this novel is the city of Istanbul itself. In this long, windy, ruminative story of forbidden love and fetishistic obsession, the city between two continents reflects the conflict of Kemal, the story's protagonist and son of one of the city's titans of export. On the brink of his engagement to the European-educated and sophisticated Sibel, the idle thirty-year-old Kemal falls for the eighteen-year-old Füsun Keskin, a humble but beautiful shopgirl with ambitions of a better life.. Kemal smuggles Füsun away for dilatory afternoons at his parent's neglected apartment. He squanders her virginity for his own selfish need, knowing that Turkey's views toward women have not moved as forward as the jet set of this city would like to believe. The cosmopolitan sect struggles to break free and embrace the Western cachet with its sexual freedoms and couture fashion while still holding onto tradition. The hypocrisies of the affluent serve as a paradise for Kemal and a prison for Füsun. Eventually, Kemal becomes his own prisoner of love and obsession, sharing this cell of desire with Füsun.. Extending over thirty-five years, but largely between 1975-1984, it begins on the precipice of change for Istanbul, with the introduction of disc jockeys, models, beauty contests, and psychoanalysis, with Istanbul both accepting and deriding the influence of European customs and acquisitions, such as a billboard of a German model drinking a new locally made soft drink, with the slogan ""You Deserve It All."" Kemal's obsession turns him into ""an anthropologist of my own experience,"" as he continues to smuggle and squander, but this time with the objects of his love, and, eventually, the city and society. Kemal also crosses paths with the seedier side of Turkish filmmaking and the decline and fall of the Yesilçam era of cinema.. As Kemal walks the streets of Istanbul, seeking his own center, the reader is taken on a disquisition of Turkish culture, politics, ambitions, and ambivalence. Pamuk is too good an author to covet a soapbox or manipulate the reader's sensibilities. We follow Kemal's postmodern journey of collection and obsession and his paradoxes of freedom and enslavement, time and inertia, the single moments and the connecting line of these indivisible junctures. The first line of the book was, ""It was the happiest moment of my life, and I didn't know it."" Does Kemal's life become a fool's journey or an honorable quest?. The title of this book is a dynamic thing in itself; by the end, you will treasure its complexity and extol its many meanings. Beyond the discursive flow of events and the action, which often takes place in Kemal's head, is his voice. Part buffoon and part philosopher, Kemal lures the reader into an almost chimerical Istanbul, as we wind through the muddy, cobblestone streets and gaze longingly and hopefully at the ancient blue Bosphorous, contemplating life through a lens of memory, capturing memories through an abundance of artifacts.. This is Orhan Pamuk's first novel since winning the Nobel Prize in 2006. It was translated into English by Maureen Freely, who grew up in Turkey and has also translated several of Pamuk's recent works.","Apr 07, 2011"
5848260,Declan,"SPOILER CONTENT 24%. ANNOYANCE CONTENT 100%. Is a novel written by an internationally acclaimed, Nobel prize winning author beyond the reach of an editor's blue pencil? How else can one explain the unnecessary, unjustified length of this novel which, if it had been half as long, would have doubled its impact. As it is every attempt by the author to introduce an element of pathos fails because of the endless variations of the same cri de coeur:. ""In these moments of unbearable longing, I would leave Sibel...and walk off into the distance to lie down in the sand, leaving my awkward body, love-starved into senselessness"".. (p.167). ""I longed to stand up and throw my arms around her...I felt such an ache in my heart that I could think no more"". (P.238). Again and again we hear of the pain suffered by Kemal because he has to live without Füsun who is, we are also repeatedly told, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Kemal is engaged to a beautiful woman, but she isn't Füsun. Cue much anguish. The extremely wealthy Kemal (29) has been having sex with Füsun (18) every afternoon, but when Kemal becomes engaged to the other beautiful woman she stops seeing him. Cue even more anguish. Unfortunately for us readers, there is little reason to find Füsun interesting. After their love-making the pair lie and listen to boys playing soccer outside. They are distantly related so they speak a little about shared aspects of their past, but what is it that makes her so fascinating that we must endure chapter after chapter of Kemal's self-indulgent paeans to this woman? Because the book is narrated by the self-obsessed Kemal, Füsun can never emerge from his version of her and become a person in her own right.. The story goes on. On and on. Kemal - perhaps intentionally, but I think not - becomes more obviously a manipulator as the novel proceeds. His wealth allows him to arrogantly misrepresent his intentions and there is little doubt but that he would have been a terrible husband for Füsun (if they had married early on), because her 'capture' would have been the beginning of his ennui. Other entertainments would have been sought. Another beauty would have had to be found for afternoon delights.. While all of this is happening we catch glimpses of infinitely more interesting events taking place over Kemal's shoulder. There is political turmoil in Istanbul; left and right are in violent conflict. The military are asserting their power and waiting for their chance to stage a coup, as they did in 1980. If we had been allowed to wander the streets and witness some of this, the novel might have ignited into explosive life. But no, we are cornered at an eternal party by the most boring man there. All the other guests look more interesting, but any hope of our being allowed to speak to them is denied as Kemal tells us again of his pain and loss.. The writing is good in parts, but all too gushing at other times. Pamuk is capable of so much better. The final device of the novel in which we learn that it had all been written by a man called ""Orhan Pamuk"" is the most annoying of all. An unconvincing, pseudo-pomo trope that is meant to in some way excuse all the tedium we have endured.","Jan 15, 2015"
10612619,Anisa Ali,"Having read a few other Pamuk novels, the format of the Museum of Innocence is structured in a similar way: the plot for a large part of the book moves very slowly but is more action-packed towards the end. This is normally a bit irritating for me and makes it difficult to maintain interest in the book, and at first it was true in this book as well, but my perspective changed once I visited the museum in Istanbul. In the museum, each chapter has its own case filled with items mentioned in the book. Seeing all the items in the museum really makes the story come to life, and you can almost picture Kemal sitting in the Merhamet Apartments, biting the ruler he and Fusun used during their tutoring sessions. After spending an afternoon reliving the story in the museum, I came to understand the very meticulous descriptions of Kemal’s visits to the Keskin’s not as unnecessary details but as a way for Pamuk to convey the extent of Kemal’s agony.. Although my initial reaction to Kemal’s devotion to Fusun was “wow that guy completely lost his mind,” after visiting the museum I began to look past that and instead tried to look at it from Kemal’s perspective. Even though his close family and friends thought he wasted his life pursuing Fusun, at the very end of the book he tells Pamuk “Let everyone know, I lived a very happy life.” Throughout the book I was constantly questioning whether or not essentially putting his life on hold was actually fulfilling for Kemal, or whether it was just a way to alleviate the pain he felt. But even though Kemal still seems a little crazy (probably to most readers), I think for him letting his life revolve around Fusun was the only way Kemal could make himself happy. And in the museum, you can really get a feel for what Pamuk means by Aristotle’s Time, and how each object in the museum represents a very real moment in time.. I also liked that the book gave readers an idea about restraints on love relationships, including social class and the code of virginity. As someone very interested in gender relations, I was interested to hear more about how Istanbul in the 1970s (as many other places throughout history and still today), women faced a double standard when it comes to virginity.. Overall I would recommend this book to anybody interested in love stories and the modern Turkish republic, but I think a museum visit really makes the story complete.","Sep 21, 2012"
566226,John,"If there is any active writer who is producing novels better than Orhan Pamuk's right now, then I desperately need to hear about it. After this, I am now forced to conclude that Pamuk is not merely a supremely talented writer, but one of those rare literary geniuses of whom there are only a handful alive at any given time.. Even if I had not recently read Proust for the first time, I am certain that this narrative of a man's tortured, obsessive love would still have reminded me of ""Swann's Way."" The protagonist Kemal Basmaci is made of three parts upper-class playboy conceit mixed with one part each of traditionalist male prejudice and superficially ""modern"" views on love relationships. Despite his initially repulsive traits as a character, we are unable to avoid sympathizing with him as he is reduced to a whimpering, masochistic fool, especially since we know from the beginning that there is simply no way that this is going to end well (and it is not a spoiler to say so).. And who can blame Kemal for feeling the way he does? It has been a criticism of Pamuk that he doesn't draw his female characters well enough, and it is true that his writing is male-centric and that we see the women from their point of view. But while some have said that İpek in ""Snow"" (to take one example) consisted of little more than references to her great beauty -- and that even that was rarely well-described -- this is not at all the case with Füsun in this novel. She is sexy, impetuous, desirable, vulnerable, by turns cold and cruel and desperate and hearbroken -- and the narrator dwells on this in lush detail.. Pamuk celebrates the real Istanbul even as his version of it has now acquired a cast of recurring characters that recalls Macondo or Yoknapatawpha County. It was especially gratifying to see the cameo by the columnist Celâl Salik (of ""The Black Book"") at Kemal's ill-fated engagement party. And of course Orhan Pamuk himself shows up. Kemal eventually asks:. ""'So tell me, have you ever been in love this way, Orhan Bey?'. ""'Hmmmmm . . . We aren't talking about me,' he said, and he fell silent."". But of course he has. There's no way you could convey it this way without having experienced it. And for that experience we are all richer.","Nov 02, 2009"
2006044,Pbwritr,"What a book! The change in the main character froom the beginning occurs os skillfully and subtly that the reader is almost unaware of it and simply floats along on the tide. Set in Turkey in 1975, a young wealthy and educated man about to be engaged in a lavish affair, meets a very young, distant cousin and begins and passionate affair with her. Naively, he believes he can keep a mistress and wife with no one being hurt. But his fiancee learns of it and breaks off the engagement, and his young love disappears for a year. Once he finds her again, Kemal takes, finds, buys and stores relics relating to Fusun, and spends time with her and her family. It's hard to discern how Fusun actually feels about him during her marriage with someone else and it seems too pat to have her die when she's finally free to be with Kemal. Talk about a flow of words about thoughts and feelings! The author does an amazing job of showing the thought processes of men and women, young and old, in the upper Turkish class about relationships between men and women, particularly before marriage and how it affects reputations, even when the participants view themselves as westernized and modern.","Dec 23, 2009"

Lolita. ; that's what amazing writers do, seduce you to the dark side with their persuasive grandiloquence.. This book kept me wondering after I've finished that I had to do further research, I. had. to separate fiction from fact.

It was expected anyway cause reading Pamuk I know I would get all those detailed vividly elaboration of narratives. There were few characters that I don't really favor but this was more to love-hate things. I like how the plot depicted Turkish culture in the 80s-- background and ambiance, the architecture, social and morality. But somehow I do feel bad for skipping some sentences and Kemal's story telling cause I don't care much about the roads, the raki and who's gonna smoke those ciggies.. While reading this I was always thought that why Kemal was so obsessed in collecting memories of Füsun when she was there by his side. Then it all makes sense nearly to the end. And so that was why. It was sad that the end of his love was a heartbroken one but I like how fairly the story goes till the end. I must say that the plot was structured well in presenting the cause and main reason of the museum. I like the earliest chapters anyway. It was a bit messy in the middle-- draggy and unnecessary at certain parts, too much going on but the end was solid and quite compelling. I like how Pamuk wrapping up the whole plot.

Then, for some reason, it just dragged on and became extremely irritating. Reading about Kemal's obsession with Füsun gets to you and then it just becomes boring and annoying.. At that point, I had decided to write the following in my review:. ""There are books that you read where it feels like you're reading about someone's life and experiencing it just like they would've, giving you this weird sense of belonging, of being part of the story...This book isn't one of those books"". HOWEVER,. I kept hoping for a good ending as I'm a firm believer that even the crappiest book can be saved by a good ending. It almost never came. I almost gave up reading the book. But damnnnnnn that ending hit hard... That last line hits hard!. And just because of that ending the book has earned a whole extra star from me..

5189565,Moon Rose,"""Without thorns, the rose of love has no fragrance."". Like a malady it possessed him, seeping through his vein like a venom that corrupted his senses with uncontrollable desire. Desire that seemed to be diluted with an elixir of life, stemming not from the conspicuous surface of his blithe existence, but from the darkest and unknown depths of his being, which stirred his mind and his heart like a compass to a direction of an eerie place rarely travelled by anyone even in dreams.... ""Spellbinding...A resounding confirmation that Orhan Pamuk is one of the great novelists of his generation. With this book, he literally puts love in our hands.""---The Washington Post. What is life be like without love? Can love even exist even without life? or perhaps, we can just safely assume that life in its totality without love is really no life at all.. Humanity has been plagued since the dawn of consciousness by all these questions about love, clouding the human mind in its collective effort with myths and legends in its quest to understand and unravel the intricate fiber that mysteriously hides love---. the veritable elixir of life. .. The interminable search for love can be likened to the futility of anyone trying to find the route to the magical stream of eternal youth as the ""desire"" of the seeker is oftentimes incongruent with his own ""ability"" to understand, appearing much too greater compared to the willingness and capacity of his mind to fully know it on its own pure merit as love in his view as seen from a world living in its exact opposite, becomes both elusive and an impossibility. It becomes an eternal quest with no apparent promise of a future.. This is how I think most readers will find themselves oscillating as the story of. Kemal. is revealed to them in. The Museum of Innocence. with the obscured face of love dissected in its true nature of irony both as a ""curse"" that could last a lifetime and a ""blessing"" that could only be regarded as truly ethereal. The level of acceptance to which. Kemal. willingly placed himself for the sake of. Füsun. will perhaps depend on the reader's inner desire and willingness to explore the darkest and deepest regions of love that would certainly appear in stark contrast to the ability and capacity of his mind to comprehend something which reason alone could not possibly understand as only the heart has the eyes to see through its naked truth.. At the very beginning of the novel, I too was mesmerized instantly by. Orhan Pamuk. 's enthralling rendition of love that seemed to capture in his eloquence the divine unity that bound both its physical and spiritual state in an overwhelming sense of awe as the joy of short-lived instances, the inscrutable yearnings, the lust and the torture of pain and absence mingled in. Kemal. 's mind and heart forcefully, making him defenseless against the power and influence of love, which can not be denied, to wreck everything in its path, carrying one to a place of ""altered"" consciousness with no sense of right and wrong, driven by a ""desire"" that seemed to emanate from that lowest bowel of the soul as it tried to reach the heavenly bliss of the higher realm.. ""They--Füsun and Kemal--were essentially good and innocent souls who suited each other perfectly, but as God had been unwilling to let them be together, we mortals were in no position to question the outcome too closely."". There was also a point in the novel where I struggled a bit, with. Kemal. 's prolonged silence of suffering over. Füsun. became a. madness. , an absurdity and an aberration to what is deemed as perfectly beautiful. It became an obsession that seemed to have a mind of its own, trickling to every moment, to every memory of his passing days as it was sheathed in every scene, in every place and in every trinket connected to. Füsun. . His memories of her had somehow put a soul to every object and to everything that reminded him of her unique beauty.--. A madness that turned every memory through every object into a divine soul, giving his life its own physical shrine of love.. ☾☯","Mar 09, 2016"
3143117,David,"Wow this was quite the read! I really succumbed to Pamuk's slow-paced love story when at several times I was annoyed. Even though there was so much praise for this book, two things arose.. First, Kemal the hero was a kleptomaniac, constantly stealing things to ""remember"" his love for Fusun. He justifies it as part of his so-to-be museum that holds up his love for the girl. Who else would gather some 4,000 cigarette butts? At this point I began to think he had some serious mental health issues. To fuel this issue, he would visit the girl and her family 4-5 times per week for seven years (even though she was married-but Pamuk almost justifies the reasons which I won't spill).. Second, I couldn't help but compare this novel to Love in The Time of Cholera. It seems to be the opposite to the Garcia Marquez novel: in GM, the hero spends decades apart but makes love to some 600 women; in this novel, the hero abstains for eight years. In GM, they never consummate their love while Kemal uses his mother's apartment to have sex something like 45 times under the guise of tutoring her. In both novels the heroes have money and the women have class issues. It just seemed like Pamuk was using GM as a model.. In light of this, the tale he tells made it hard to put down. I also enjoyed the fact that he introduced Pamuk himself into the novel which added a degree of lightness to the book. I certainly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it. plus I may track down some of his other books.","Apr 21, 2011"

That being said, the author does nothing to let the reader know why Kemal is obsessed with Fusun, the way he is, which borders on stalking!! Instead he spends pages and pages telling us over and over, how beautiful she was with her cream coloured arms!!! Nothing is said about any redeemable characteristics she may have and what we read about her and her actions is just proof that she does not have a ""plausible and worthy of attention"" character.. The worst part of the book is when the authors describes, in painful details, the 8 years that Kemal really stalks Fusun and her family.. And what's with that stealing that the author again tries in-vain to make it look like a sweet act of love?!!!. All that turn the book into the very boring, annoying and sick tale of an obsession!.

Because he had lost the touch, perhaps his fame does not allow an editor to kick his ass around like he should have done, I don't know. But I do take much value away from this book. How Pamuk took apart Turkish traditional vs. modern cultural elements and reassembled them to appear as their exact opposites (that a rich, modern, educated, man would find out through depth of years of experience that love found once in reckless sexual abandon is then refound in the purely traditional (sitting with a girls' family watching TV night after night, not touching her), nearly an arranged marriage.

2338568,B. Asma,"The Museum of Innocence is the fourth Pamuk book I read and the most interesting. The story goes deeply into the psychology of a man Kemal Basmacı with regard to an obsessive, life-guiding love for a woman Füsun. The obsession leads him to collect items associated with her even including the Keskin family house which will become the museum for the collectibles.. I read the hardcover, purchased for a dollar from a discount rack (if you can believe that), and simultaneously read along with John Lee, who dramatically read on Random House Audio. While the novel was translated into English, there were many Turkish names and places for which the recording was a huge help in pronunciation and recognition should that ever be necessary in real experience.. Besides the quaint romance and the Istanbulite setting, Pamuk attempted to portray Istanbul in the 1970s and 1980s. The reader experiences life in that city--the views onto the Bosphorus, the restaurants, the cinemas and film stars, the music, the food, the family entertainments in the evening, the subjects which elicited gossip, the streets and thoroughfares, the weather, the life under a curfew, and the people who lived, worked, and loved there..

Moreover, the novel's central conceit, of a narrator showing readers around a(n) (impossible?) museum (dedicated to the woman the narrator has loved and lost, and comprised of objects associated with her in the narrator's mind), and providing the very context that museum visitors are typically bereft of, perhaps does nothing so much as demonstrate the impossibility of ever fully accounting for any object, of completely exhausting its meaning and significance.

737570,Joel,"There were times this book was so intensely tedious (there is an entire chapter called ""Sometimes"" that has every sentence beginning with ""Somtimes"" and then description after description of mundane things like ""Sometimes when it rains out I feel sad; Sometimes the rain slashes against the window and leaves marks)I thought I would scream.. At first I thought this was a book of obsession. Taking place in Instanbul at a time when the city is struggling between the old ways and the new western ways, it is the story of a man in love with a woman he cannot have.. The sense of place is so interesting; you have a feel for Istanbul during this period of great change. This is a story of struggle between accepting and rejecting the prevailing cultural norms. At times you want to shake everyone in the story.. Somehow, at the very end, in the last pages, you realize it not a story of obsession and unhappiness but rather one of love and happiness.","Nov 16, 2009"
11986475,Ellen,"Wonderfully poetic, I compare the author Gabriel Garcia Marquez.. Moreover, I have heard of the conceit of imagining the backstory of items in museums-- an idea that I fear could turn tedious in the wrong hands. But we are in excellent hands with Orhan Bey (may I call you that?) The chapter on Time and Clocks and the relation of these concepts in our lives. The author combines philosophy with homeyness with clocks-you-have-known, and the ultimate observation that we don't use clocks to tell time anyway. And from the platform of the clocks, we derive several layers of alternative meaning and secret language between a couple who know each other so well that the disposition of the clock tells more about their relationship to each other than to time itself.. All this mastery of storytelling, and whimsy too.. The last chapter is titled happiness; I will say I would have found a bit more happiness in the story refreshing. Nevertheless it is a wonderful book.","Sep 07, 2015"
3357765,Jimmy,"I thought it was a masterpiece. This is the second book I have read by the Nobel Prize winning Turkish author, and I have loved them both. I noticed a lot of negative reviews. I am always wary of recommending a book like this. You should be able to judge for yourself if it would be something worth reading. If your idea of a good read is Flowers in the Attic, this book is not for you. If reading a book can make you depressed, as some reviewers suggested, skip this one and check with a doctor. For me it was absolutely brilliant. And another great reading on compact disc.. I was fascinated by the mix of Islam and western influence. The treatment of women is suggested quite often. I think progressives can be somewhat tolerant of the blatant disregard of women's rights in Muslim countries. I find that concerning.. I was also fascinated by the frequent mention of kisses. Whoa! Hot stuff! I cannot imagine any example of western literature where that would occur.","Jun 07, 2019"

1642339,Lisa McKenzie,"In lieu of obtaining the object of his obsession, our narrator collects objects; any object that stimulates an association with his beloved will do. Her cigarette butts are his holy relics; her saltshaker, his devotional scapular. Orhan Pamuk pursues the notion that romantic obsession is intrinsically objectifying, thus inherently destructive. With nods to Nabokov and Proust, Pamuk plays out this premise to the bitter end, but he does it on his own turf. This is not so much a novel about a universal truth, as a (painfully) thorough exploration of social class and sexuality in a particular time and place.. If it were possible, I would have opted for four and half stars. (I'm not a fan of Proust or Proust like descriptions, although I concede they were essential for the narrative conceit.) It's a better read than Pamuk's previous novel, Snow.","Mar 09, 2010"
12492119,Shoresh Noorani,"I had a great time voyaging through the book. The novel's pivotal framework is the timeworn rich-boy-loves-poor-girl motif whereas the celebrated Turkish Nobel-laureate novelist Orhan Pamuk manages to revivify this trite motif by planting the story within a very weighty and consequential time frame of the seventies that is regarded as a momentous period in which Tradition and Modernity peaked to a head-t-head clash. Kamal and Fusun's love story is the genuine canvas upon which all the philosophical inquiries of love,eastern love and failure are depicted alongside the social and political fluctuations of a nation. Objects play a very important role in both the protagonist's life and the reader's experience of this fictional museum. Objects or museum exhibits are promoted to a superhuman stature and status.","Apr 15, 2013"

But in The Museum of Innocence, shall I compare thee to Shakespeare's?. Too overwhelmed with sadness as I read the book. I wouldn't recommend the book with ones who just have their hearts broken. The book is well written by Pamuk and his pieces never disappoint me. One might say oh its just another cliche love story where two different castes collide and they fell in love with another. But the society gaps drew them apart. I agree with that but Pamuk's writing made it so hard to resist the book.. This is another modern Romeo and Juliet. As Fusun breathed her last breathe, she reminded me of Last Kiss by Pearl Jam.. Losing is fine but enduring makes it hard to go on.","May 01, 2013"
295770,Samin Rb,"I did like the idea of narrator's obsession with the objects throughout the whole book, I also liked very much the chapter on Kamal's physical pain out of sorrow. Apart from these two, the book was more of a shallow love story, a rich man talking about and longing for a poor beautiful arrogant girl whom he hardly knows/ informs anything about her. Man! You are going to the your beloved's house for eight years, visiting her regularly, and what do we know about her? Very little! Just the fact that she is very very beautiful, she loves to be an actress, she loves to drive, she entertains herself with drawing birds. But nothing about her mentality, Fusan has been framed in the book more like a mythic figure, (maybe intentionally) a frozen object in the museum rather than a vivid character.. Moreover, Pamuk's repetitive statements about the ""West"" was a big turn off for me.","Sep 21, 2015"

This story is heartbreaking in every dimension of it, it gives hope once in a while and it takes it back. Kemal is a hopeless guy in general terms, because he doesn't seem to have anything that actually makes him happy, but in fact he is the typical type of person who is determined and sees the bright side.I wish I was a bit like him, he just knows what he wants and waits for it.

10577332,Matt Luedke,"Meticulous, beautiful, and real. That's the quick way of describing both this book, its corresponding museum in real life, and it's protagonist, Kemal. Again, Orhan Pamuk has written a book that matches its main character stylistically; see my review of Snow from earlier this year for another example (I'll probably be referencing my review of Snow later, so beware of any potential cross-novel spoilers to come).. Let me back up a little and tell you the context in which I read this book. When I began, I knew that I would be traveling to Turkey (and Istanbul, as part of the trip) for my first time just a few months later. I had read My Name Is Red and Snow, and enjoyed both (though Snow impacted me a little more, I'd say). Knowing that Pamuk had written a non-fiction book (Istanbul) about the city, I was tempted to read that. On the other hand, I heard that he had just opened the real-life museum that corresponds with this book. There wasn't enough time to read both before I left, considering the amount of time I usually devote to reading nowadays. Which one would help me have the best experience when I went there?. The decision was made with regard to what my girlfriend wanted to do as well, but the fictional route was chosen (those who know me may have heard me say before that I understand fictional things more than I do real ones) and I began Museum. I use the word ""fictional"" to describe the book just as a brute-force categorization, only necessary if you are stocking the book in a store or library and are compelled to choose a section. In truth, this fictional book is probably the most heavily crossed-over into reality I have experienced (I use the word ""experienced"" instead of ""read"" here; I believe it is more accurate and Kemal would approve). I'm sure Istanbul is also a good book, and I look forward to reading it, but I am extremely happy with my choice.. The entire story is told by Kemal (as related by Orhan, who again inserts himself into the book as its ""editor,"" so to speak), so we are made painfully aware of even his most minute emotions; some lasting seconds and others lasting years. He is obsessed with Fusun, who initially returns his love but becomes ever more complex as she grows up. Since we lack her perspective, we often get less of her side of the story; events where Kemal is not present are only learned much later, if at all. She has several friends we do not meet, she has goals and emotions we don't fully understand, and she sometimes seems to act or say things that are hard to predict. Kemal is obsessively aware of her minute actions (the way she snubs out the many cigarettes collected in the museum, for example), or the small objects she interacts with... but there is still so much depth to her he does not know (and therefore nor do we). When they make eye contact, he remarks that he imagines what her thoughts are, but can never know completely. The boundaries to Kemal's incessant gazing are again made obvious at the ending, when even Kemal's meticulous attention to detail is revealed to have been fooled for years with the unexpected presence of a certain (very important) earring.. Even with all the shortcomings of Kemal's ability to narrate her part of the story (or maybe because of them?) I came away thinking that Fusun was the most interesting female character written by a male author that I have read (except maybe Anna Karenina herself).. The ending events, to me, alluded to events towards the end of The Great Gatsby-- with a car accident spurring the final tragic separation between two lovers kept apart by the world for so long. As I was reading that part, I paused because of the emotion of it all, and my mind instinctively drifted towards wondering: how could that have been avoided? Who was at fault?. Was it Kemal? For years he effectively ignored what Fusun wanted to do with her life, playing along just enough so that he was involved-- but not enough that she actually became successful, out of a jealous fear that her popularity would skyrocket her past him into a life without him. He had lied to her in the past, at her most vulnerable. Did he objectify her too much? Could the tragedy have been avoided if he had just listened to her more often than only when she made ultimatums?. Was it Fusun? She never seemed to outgrow her tendency to get passive aggressive whenever confronted with the injustices in the world. When presented with either the corrupt bureaucracy needed to get anything legally-related done, or the sexism seeped into the culture around her, or anything else that unfairly limited her ability to be free (like an uncaged bird... who can drive like Grace Kelly), Fusun would usually bottle and explode. She would often ""give up"" and refuse to participate in the unfair world, and her (still unknown, though Kemal once again believes he can define the meaning in their last moments of eye contact) motivations with her last actions may have been final manifestation of her bottling tendency. If she had expressed her frustrations in a more productive way, could she and Kemal have avoided tragedy and been happy?. Was it something more subtle, like Istanbul's culture itself? Maybe the ""upper class,"" Westernizing culture? Kemal's old friends give us a glimpse of what his life could have been like. In Kemal's younger years, everyone around him convinced him that he ""deserved it all,"" (a slogan from a soda brand owned by Kemal's friend Zaim). So he tried to have a relationship both with Fusun and with Sibel, a nice, respectable sort of girl from a richer family. Later, Sibel was well-meaning in her attempts to ""cure"" Kemal of his inappropriate love, but she eventually can't take it anymore. As Kemal goes over the deep end in his obsession, he still retains just enough self-awareness for it not to be completely disturbing-- but all his self-awareness is guilt and shame (until he starts pursuing the development of his museum, that is). If the upper class had not frowned upon the relationship between Kemal and Fusun, or had instilled in Kemal a value system that made him a more mature person earlier, would the two of them have been able to love and live as they wanted?. Maybe it was the other side of Istanbul's culture-- the more traditional, religious side? The virginity of women still had such a mystical effect on Fusun and almost everyone else, and maybe the absence of such a fixation could have let their relationship just be about love and not outdated notions of purity?. My answer is that it was all and none. For better or worse, Istanbul was what it was, Kemal was who he was, and Fusun was who she was. They were all bound by flawed but real forms of love. And the Museum of Innocence, the book and the actual museum itself, seems to be dedicated to making them all as real as possible. Without blaming any party to the tragedy (perhaps hence the name of the museum), without any shame, without withholding any embarrassing sections (as some of the sources Orhan consults would have preferred), and with pride.. I can confirm all those elements in the actual museum, as my own story now kicks back in (in true Orhan fashion, here I come in my own review!). I was about 2/3 of the way through the story when my girlfriend and I traveled to Istanbul, and made the Museum one of our priority destinations. We each got in for free by getting our books stamped (in a later bit of irony for a book so concerned with the collection of sentimental objects, I lost my prized stamped copy of the book on the return flight and read the remainder of the novel on my Kindle). Walking around the museum, with our copies of the book in hand, pointing out the various objects and remembering their significance was an amazing and unique experience.. After being introduced to the ""historical"" Istanbul by the grandiose museums at the Hagia Sophia and the like earlier that weekend, I can't imagine a better introduction to the ""real"" Istanbul. The building itself is easy to walk to from the other downtown, and we even saw various other landmarks from the novel by chance (we used the Hilton where Kemal and Sibel have their engagement party, and the Divan where Kemal and his brother share raki as landmarks as we called our own hotel to get directions-- only later remembering their importance in the story). A map I picked up from our hotel aided me in reading the rest of the book. My trip as a whole was amazing for many other reasons ;) but the role of this book and the museum were undoubtedly a large part in that. And when I returned to the US and finished the book, I really felt like I was able to get the full emotional punch out of the amazing ending.. Because the story isn't over-- it didn't end when Fusun's and Kemal's relationship did. It echoes back to the ending of Snow, even referencing the exact quote that I did in my review of that book. Kemal expresses his disagreement with the final scene of Orhan's novel Snow, which proclaims that we readers cannot fully understand the characters and their world. Kemal instead believes that, if we read the book and visit the museum, we ""will most certainly understand."" Whether you agree or not is up to you-- I find myself intrigued, not troubled, by what I still do not fully know. But Kemal believes that the bridge can be made, which tells us a lot about him-- and perhaps makes his belief a self-fulfilling prophecy.","Oct 02, 2012"
169557,Ashley,"This is a beautiful novel. It depicts a love that is stymied, beset by obstacles, almost squelched. It also catalogues the time and place in which it is set -- the 1970s and 80s in several districts of Istanbul, Turkey -- with a convincing richness of detail, because the features of life at the time which the narrator describes--coûps d'etat and curfews, parties of wealthy families from which the protagonist comes and the comparison that this class draws between itself and the West--are not analyzed as anything of importance outside of how they form the backdrop and setting for what is truly transpiring, and what is of real importance, which is the transfixing and tragic love story between a young man and a young woman, which the narrator is recounting. The narrator is able to catalogue these features very well, because, as the protagonist and someone who is wholly consumed in love, he is actually indifferent to whatever else is around him. This makes his account of these things all the more reliable. The unloosening yet persistence of the time's restrictive social and sexual mores, both of which he recounts, forms the social context in which this story unfolds.. I found this book extremely difficult to read. At times, I literally couldn't sustain my attention to it out of pain for what the narrator was experiencing and out of unhappiness at the prospect of what I thought I knew would happen. As a result, I did not do as much justice as I could have to what I now realize is a novel that is not as predictable as it seems. The pain of which I speak comes because the book is told retrospectively. From its first moments, the reader discovers that ""The Museum of Innocence"" will tell an unhappy story -- or at least that the happiest moments of the novel will be in the beginning. If the happiest parts of the book are in the beginning, it is difficult to countenance the fact that the story will become progressively sadder, the fates of the characters deteriorating with time. If the reader manages to persist in reading this book, they will find themselves amply rewarded, completely moved, stunned, torn, and deeply ambivalent about that which they just read.. The story is set in Istanbul's ""high society,"" which is a small set of families rich in comparison to the rest of the city. The narrator, Kemal, lives a life of privilege, beauty, and lushness of which he is both aware and mostly untroubled. The novel explores the tension that this group of people, especially the women, experience between understanding themselves as modern and liberated and as Turkish and family-oriented. In this novel, the drama takes place in terms of women feeling pressured--and pressuring themselves--to maintain their virginity until marriage. If it were discovered that a woman was no longer a virgin in a way that was visible or undeniable to the group as a whole, even if, privately, those in that group would happily accept that women were having intercourse before marriage and do so themselves, it is possible that no man would then want to marry such a woman, if the man with whom she was having intercourse did not marry her himself, nonetheless. The loss of virginity before marriage, therefore, constitutes a risk for women, potentially leading them to suffer social isolation, or at least not realize their frequent desire to get married, still the main socially acceptable path open to women of the time to pursue, as a result. For the female characters in the novel in particular, therefore, the stakes of being ""liberated"" and following one's desires is high.. Beyond showing with what women in ""high society"" must contend, ""The Museum of Innocence"" also shows the way in which other young women in Turkish society are pursuing more unconventional and liberated pathways, particularly those who come from lower or middle class origins. The novel's other central character, Füsun, the woman with whom the narrator falls in love, is one such woman. Füsun attempts to live for herself, charting her own course in the slightly less restrictive, more open and increasingly commercial Turkish society of the time. For instance, at an age of about 16, the reader discovers that she had entered a beauty contest, thereby taking a more visible place in society than would previously have been acceptable, yet one which is still controversial.. The story of the love and intimacy that both she and Kemal share--its promise and the obstacles that they confront--propel the story forward. For Kemal, his relationship with Füsun is both the realm of transcendence and something that he constantly and painfully questions, wondering if the love he feels for her is indeed love or if he is in the grips of an unhealthy obsession. The occasion for his doubt is their early division, for which he is arrogantly and unwittingly responsible. This division motivates him to try to win her back, an attempt which lies at the heart of the novel.. In addition to being a love story, it is also a meditation on the nature of love.. As a narrator, Kemal is reflective, intelligent, and, retrospectively at least, self-aware. In the utter precision and beauty of the descriptions of the fluctuation of each and every mood that he has in response to Füsun's behavior towards him, the novel evokes his love and the unhappiness that follows from her having left him extremely convincingly. Once he loses her, his ecstasy and bliss, so well-evoked in the opening scenes, becomes an unrelenting onslaught of loss for which the only salve for him is memories of her evoked through his handling of her things, or things that she has touched while they were together, summoning to him temporarily the reality her presence. Thus, physical objects take on an exaggerated importance, and collecting things associated with her becomes a way in which he can express his love for her that he cannot through a relationship with her. It is painful and sad to see this substitution necessarily happen, and, like the narrator, the reader is tormented by being in the position of being in the head of such a person. These objects begin to form their own universe, and, retrospectively, Kemal begins to see in the Keskins (Füsun's family), the emblem of all Turkey, expressing its greatest truths and being the font of all that is lovely, significant, and worth living for within it.. While this part of the story is very frustrating, because, instead of being about the immediacy of the story, the reader sees it from the outside, as catalogued through the objects and cultural analysis that Kemal, in his retrospective re-telling of his story, focuses on, it also seems significant in a way that I do not fully understand yet.. And, yet, more importantly for me, Kemal and Füsun's story could have been different. The sexism within it is ubiquitous and insidious. Kemal, though extremely intelligent, is unself-aware and unreflective of his privilege as a male not to be tied to restrictive gender norms limiting what is acceptable for him to do such that he does not even realize that he is, in fact, imposing these very restrictive norms on Füsun. The novel thus poses questions about the reality of love. How much can we know about our beloved? How much does he know about his beloved? A more complete liberation for the two characters--especially Füsun--could have been possible, but was not realized, chiefly because of Kemal's own unreflective, possessive and selfish obsession with his love for her. Paradoxically, his love also becomes an instrument of her limitation, suffering, and oppression.. The cadence of this paradox makes the reader wonder if love truly possesses the liberating qualities to which we attribute it. The fact that that liberating quality of love does not lead Kemal to become aware of his actions means that -- indirectly -- the novel tells the story of the insidiousness of gender-based social restriction and the inability that we have, despite our best efforts at self-reflexivity, to realize the harms that we are doing to others. The initially undaunted, in some ways reckless course of action that this young woman takes is inspiring. She takes risks for love, experience, knowledge, life, and desires, untwisted by what society might have made her feel for them. In light of this, the unfulfillment of her dreams in their entirety is tragic because they could have been been so.. Thus, despite the ""Museum of Innocence"" being agonizing to read, this story matters. The blind and thus frustrating side of the story--his story--is made fully believable and moving, because it so palpably and convincingly expresses his love for the woman from whom he cannot and does not want to escape, whom he harms, and with whom he is inextricably intertwined because of his love for her and vice versa. Thus, her tragedy becomes his tragedy. And we have to be content with his voice as a substitute for the missing thing: hers. Through him, we get a glimpse of this remarkable woman, standing in for so many others like her, who have been minimized by their lovers and by the attitudes and norms that decide what is acceptable behavior, and who have come to tragic ends.. This lush, dream-like, beautiful novel brings to light the possibility of people to assert themselves and find beauty in it.","Aug 25, 2017"
15523221,Sumallya Mukhopadhyay,"The Museum of Innocence, Orhan Pamuk. Here’s a society caught in the crossroad of tradition and modernity. In such a society, slippages, mistakes and wrongdoings are rampant. Morality is driven by passion, and passion itself is intolerably dictated by the exorbitant rise of capital and emulation of western society. Trust appears to be a virtue lost in time. Love is scarcely sacred. Love cannot last in a society where pretentious parties are as important as a woman losing her virginity. Here, Pamuk decides to make love effervescent and true. And thus, he sacrifices one of his wonderfully crafted character, Fusun, just to make people believe in love.. Who exactly is Fusum in the novel? Kemal’s initial infatuation. Her papa’s darling girl. One who aspires to be in movies. Never does. One who simply paints but never puts them in exhibition. Who dies as soon as she finds security and sensibility.. How painful can one character be! Also, equally beautiful. Sensuous. Kemal falls for Fusun when he is least expecting it. Like spasmodic irritation, Fusum appears before him and unleashes chaos in his wealthy playboy life. Even before he realises, Kemal dives headlong in his own doom. But, love comes at expense of something, right? After all, we are caught in a crossroad between tradition and modernity. We cannot choose sides. We are trapped in the liminal space offered by both these ideologies. Love helps maintain the balance. Kemal maintains his by smuggling items from Fusun’s place. He devotes the rest of his life in creating a museum in her memory, stocking it with panties, nutcrackers, china dogs, 4,213 cigarette stubs and sundry other trifles recovered from their moments together.. Pamuk tries to arrest time through the rendering of a lover’s desire to make his beloved’s image timeless. He doesn’t try to recover the time Kemal has lost pursuing Fusum. He tries to relive them through the material objects that Kemal has carried. And Pamuk keeps on reiterating it. He creates a time zone for Kemal where he pushes everyone he knows slowly out of his life, embracing stasis, repetition in the process. It is possible to read him as the one who embodies the toxicity and masculinity of his age. But such a reading can be problematic; instead I would request the reader to read him as someone whose saintly love eulogizes the women as well as the wounded city of Istanbul.","Jun 26, 2019"
35416531,Nikita Punjabi,"When I was almost done with half the book, I just couldn’t understand the reason why this book was written in the first place. A lot of books are about love, so what was different?. Kemal’s love for Fusun was extraordinary and unprecedented. It’s a tale of love and loss, wanting to be with your loved one, no matter what the world thinks of you. Some might even call it obsession. I think there was a very thin line between Kemal’s love and his obsession for Fusun. At some places that line was definitely crossed to call it obsession but that’s the whole point! We probably don’t understand love like he did.. What made this book really interesting was the museum itself! Hope I can visit it sometime.","Apr 15, 2019"

This story narrates the obsessive love of a 30 year old man towards his 18 year old distant relative despite being about to be engaged to a beautiful aristocratic girl who is closer to him in age.. The story takes us through the then socio-cultural and political scene in Turkey , esp in Istanbul.. Enjoyed the initial three fourths of the book, and the last fourth dragged a bit..

1655341,Susan,"Falling Rock Zone: Keys to the Museum of Innocence. For Henry James fiction was a house with many windows. In Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk’s 500-page 2008 novel The Museum of Innocence, fiction is a museum with many rooms cluttered with objects that tell the love story of Kemal and Füsun. The story overflows into the sounds of tugboats on the Bosphorus, green parks, and street corners turned into festive slaughter grounds encompassing Istanbul from the 1950’s to the first years of the aughts.. The defining event of Kemal’s narration of his love for Füsun occurs in the early 1970’s in Istanbul. Shortly before his formal engagement to the Westernized Sibel the rich and idle 30-year-old Kemal falls in lust with his distant relation, a shop clerk named Füsun. With Füsun just eighteen, their sexual bond is not technically criminal under Turkish law; but it is hardly innocent. His obsession shapes Kemal’s life and takes shape over 35 years as a museum in Çukurcuma Street.. Like the connection between Füsun and Kemal, the title of the novel is suspect. The Museum of Innocence is an amateur’s effort to create a Taj Mahal that turns into a horde of objects taking over an entire house that Kemal eventually purchases in the street where Füsun lived. Kemal begins by stealing Füsun’s lipsticks, hairclips, and cigarette butts to help himself remember afternoons of unfettered passion that ended. “You cannot possess her sexually, but you can possess the objects,” Pamuk explained in a November, 2012 interview with The Telegraph.. The museum itself is duplicitous: it is both a figment and something real. It is a container that exists independently like a Platonic idea; and yet the museum is perceptible in multiple forms. At the end of Pamuk’s novel, there is a free ticket for entrance into the Museum of Innocence founded by Pamuk and opened in Istanbul in 2012. Pamuk’s catalog for his museum, The Innocence of Objects, is also the title for Grant Gee’s 2012 semi-documentary film, also called The Innocence of Objects, narrated by a fictional character who takes issue with Kemal’s view of events. Pamuk’s Museum of Innocence is lately a traveling exhibition, on display between January 19 and June 24, 2018, at the Museo Bagatti Valsecchi in Milan. The Museo Bagatti Valsecchi served Pamuk and his narrator Kemal as a model for the type of museum each aspired to build.. The names Pamuk chose tell a simple if not innocent story. Füsun, whose name means charm in Turkish, heats up Kemal so much that his fiancée Sibel, whose name means raindrop, evaporates into the mist of Istanbul’s high society. Kemal was the middle name of Atatürk, founder of Kemalism, the Westernization movement that made a hash of Turkish minorities. In a twisted way, Kemal causes Füsun’s disappointment and death. Much of the story takes place in Füsun’s parents’ shabby apartment in Çukurcuma Street, where Kemal eats thousands of dinners with Füsun and her husband and Füsun’s parents. Despite meaning unreal in Farsi, Çukurcuma is the real street where the Museum of Innocence stands. Appropriately, Çukurcuma shares a root with cyclos, the Greek word for circle: The Museum of Innocence circles between the ideal and real.. The Museum of Innocence cycles through Western literature. As Pamuk explained to Judy Stone in an interview on his own website, “I sometimes feel I don't belong to any country. If I belong to a republic, I belong to a republic of literature.” Kemal’s narrative maintains the tireless energy and list-making mania of Robert Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy. Kemal is even more unreliable a narrator than Lolita’s Humbert Humbert; Kemal’s opinions are often contradicted by the novel's right-thinking characters, his mother, his abandoned fiancée Sibel, and Füsun. Towards the end of the novel “Orhan Pamuk,” who had danced with Füsun at the engagement party of Kemal and Sibel, steps in for a second time. Majestically, like Humpty-Dumpty, “Pamuk” takes control of the story’s meaning by claiming authorship of The Museum of Innocence. At what point “Pamuk” took over as narrator is not clear; all we learn is that Kemal died while in Milan on his way to visit the Museo Bagatti Valsecchi.. While Henry James afforded clear views of characters inviting multiple interpretations, Pamuk, more like James Joyce, creates clouded labyrinths requiring road maps. To quote a sign I saw while driving in the Lake District of England years ago: “Falling rock zone. You have been warned.” Pamuk has broken out of the house of fiction.","Jan 13, 2018"
1719314,Jacek,"A painful book all along the way, with several artful and particularly impressive/unpleasant peaks of pain (the engagement party; the days in the house by the water where the fisherman and his son pass by in the dawn; the first evening visit to Cukurcuma; the beginning of the trip to Europe), and stretches of purposeful dreariness. The work is an achievement all right, but not one I expect wanting to revisit, for both of the reasons above. Typically great discussions with the students in the two classes we dedicated to the book: no one agreeing on anything, nothing conclusive to grab onto, plenty of impassioned arguments.","Nov 10, 2019"
2422285,James Murphy,"Love stories, novels about love, love poetry are easy to like because we can all relate to them. Breathless moments of intense feeling, passion, and the longing to be with someone are things we've all experienced. The loves of fictional characters reflect our own. We enjoy accounts of such intense emotion because they meant so much to us and because we recall them as happy. The Museum of Innocence has that going for it. And it has Pamuk's comfortable prose style going for it.. There are two things wrong with the novel: Kemal and Fusun, the lovers. He never made them realistically vibrant for me. This is one of those novels in which the protagonist, Kemal, talks ceaselessly about his condition, in this case his obsession with Fusun. His voice is an apologetic drone about love lost, then found but unrequited and longed for. Even when Kemal has Fusun's love he's awash in a sea of mooning and reminiscence, agonizing about mistakes he's made. The details of his unhappiness are bound in the novel's conceit of a museum memorializing Fusun and his love for her. This premise leads to unfortunate chapters which challenge patience, like the one in which he describes collecting 4213 cigarette butts she smoked in the years he visited her family's apartment.. If Kemal isn't infectious, neither is Fusun. As wonderful a writer as Pamuk is, in this love story he failed to convince me Fusun was worth Kemal's obsession. Fusun is 2-dimensional, and as a love interest this should not be so. Her dream is to become a star in Turkish art films. To the reader she seems as distant as if she were already an image thrown on the screen. Kemal speaks poetically about Fusun's thighs and breasts or the way she tosses her head or smiles in company, but as vigorous as my imagination can be I couldn't hold her reality as a young woman in love and loved. The society Kemal mixes with is upscale Istanbul, coolly sophisticated, confident. These, Kemal's and Fusun's young friends, are as sketchily portrayed as they are. The people who come most alive in the novel are those distanced from that group by age or attitude, like Fusun's mother, Nesibe, or Kemal's chauffeur, Cetin.. All this isn't necessarily bad. Elements like the 2-dimensionality and Kemal's moony condition can work, especially in the hands of a novelist as adroit as Pamuk, but in a novel half the length of this 532-page doorstop. So this reader, at least, wearied of this interminable love story in which often the most interesting thing going on is the storks migrating back and forth over Istanbul.","Nov 06, 2009"
1457001,Stephen Durrant,"Pamuk is a major writer, and this is a fascinating novel. It is also, at times, frustrating . . . even maddening. We descend for hundreds of pages into the obsessive world of Kemel Bey, who has lost his love Fusun and turns his entire remaining years into acts of remembering, indulging, maybe we could say ""wallowing."" At times even a reader moved by the lyrical beauty of Pamuk's prose, as his narrator relives the tiniest moments from his past, wants to scream out, ""Please, Kemel, get a life!"" But there is something much more important going on in this novel than just one character hopelessly stuck in memory. The book is about larger issues: why do we collect? what is a museum . . . or what should it be? And, finally, maybe happiness does exist for many of us in reliving endlessly moments from our past that we cannot (and why should we?) get over? Plus Pamuk is a master of the ending, and toward the end of this novel we learn that it is actually a guidebook to Kemel's own personal museum, a museum put together after he has visited thousands of other small museums around the world. But unlike most guidebooks, Kemel has commissioned a friend of his, a certain Orhan Pamuk, to write it in novelistic form. But beyond the literary games and philosophical musings, this is a wonderful novel about a great city, Istanbul, and its people caught between a European future and a very traditionalist Muslim past. If only one could give a half star, this would definitely merit 4 1/2. But reader beware, this is not a novel that will satisfy all tastes. It helps if one is the type who occasionally, perhaps after a drink of Scotch, not only stares out the window and wallows a bit in memory but turns attention also to some material object that carries an ""imprint"" of some cherished past event.","Dec 02, 2010"
21147965,Bindiya,"Genius of Orhan Pamuk is not in the brilliance of his prose, but his ability to weave an aura that mystically wafts up from the written pages and permeates the skin and gets absorbed in the bones. He creates this world of Huzun - of Defeated spirits, of loss of purpose, of pervasive and chronic pain,of intense heart-break that is almost physical and of this deep agonsing melancholia. Of all his books, Museum of Innocence communicates this Huzun the best, and in reading it, you can't help but be infected by it. The story is set in Turkey of 1970s, with its cultural and moral absolutes staring in the face of onslaught of change. Characters and indeed the country are constantly struggling to define their aspirations. What does it mean to be modern and western? With the touch of a master Pamuk has managed to convey the intense arguments on cultural significance of length of women's skirts, smoking, drinking and pre-marital sex with precise nuances without a hint of any moral undertones.. Pamuk's narrative is always layered with textured views, he can describe stillness and every split-second, he captures snapshots in life as it moves. The book is about the love Kemal has for Fusun, the 'poor' distant relation in a deeply divided society, and how this love develops into a beautiful, self-destructive obsession or devotion like they would describe it in Hindi movies. Kemal collects objects and creates a museum of memories, 2,473 cigarette butts, china digs, combs, match-sticks some made significant with a memory, others for their own sake. He creates a physical show-case for his life and times. I always have a love-hate relationship with Pamuk's books, they are beautifully written and you feel enriched for having read them, but they move you deeply and like a black-hole suck you in to their dark, melancholy world and keep you there for the duration.","Nov 05, 2014"
3018134,Karen ,"This was the perfect book to have had in hand at the outset of a cold, snowed in weekend. I could not have cared less that I wasn't going anywhere for days because the book takes hold of the reader and transports one to another time and place. While some other reviewers commented on the eroticism of the novel, I don't see it as being erotic, rather I found it seductive, so much so that I had a hard time putting it down. Kemal is also seduced. At one point his fiancee, Sibel, comments to him that he's becoming the kind of man who enjoys being unhappy and I think that's a key point- Kemal is seduced by unhappiness throughout the novel; first by the forbidden nature of what he's doing-socially unacceptable in so many ways and knowing that if found out, he will suffer for it. Even before his betrayal of Sibel is known, he's seduced by his misery and then by the pathetic relief he obtains from touching and smelling items that had been handled by his muse. I think there are few people who have not taken pleasure from the scent of an absent lover lingering on the bed sheets- but Kemal takes this pleasure to an obsessive extreme when he pilfers entirely useless items from Fusun's family home- four thousand cigarette butts is obsessive in the extreme, but he's seduced into this weird behavior by his obsession, so seduced that he never really wakes up to the fact that this is completely unhealthy, yet the book is entirely fascinating. An honest person is going to find pieces of themselves in various places in this book, but that recognition in itself carries a bit of salvation that Kemal never finds.","Dec 28, 2009"
4436497,Mweene,"Where do i start? Ah yes lets start with the protagonist, Kemal. One of the disturbing things about this character is not that there is very little to like about him, but the fact that there is equally very little to hate about him. Its like they said about George Bush Sr (although it kind of applies to W as well); ""the striking thing about the president is that there is nothing striking about him'. There are two characters that are central in this book i.e. Kemal and his love interest who also happens to be his much younger cousin. This in short makes the book about an obsessed incestuous sugar daddy. It is over 600 pages and believe me its no easy read. I constantly found myself wondering just what the heck i thought i was trying to pull here; reading such a book. The character says he is or was happy but then he goes on to display what is probably the most miserable life any individual can ever live. To make matters even more antagonist he drags the reader into this misery with him. Indeed i was most unhappy when reading this book and the fact that it is over 600 pages of infatuation with tragic consequences just made things that much worse.. The good news is that i have in no way given up on Mr Pamuk. I mean that has got to be one of the coolest names in the writing business; Orhan Pamuk. Honestly, how do you give up on a writer with a name like that? So i am going to give him two more chances,namely; Snow and My Name is Red. As for this book i simply have to quote what some other reviewer said about some other book; 'it is not a book to be lightly thrown aside, it should be thrown with great force'.","Oct 20, 2010"
35445447,Landy Liu,"I started reading this last October after I moved to Istanbul. It took me nearly a year not because it's a boring book, but because Pamuk tells a story of a man's whole life, eight years of which are spent on looking for his love throughout the city and when he finally finds her he starts creepily stalking her and her family, so nothing really happens for like 200 pages. I visited the museum on April 11th this year, when I was halfway through the book. That day, according to the last pages I just read, was also one day before ten years since Kemal passed away. There was a couple making out hardcore right next to us blocking the items we wanted to see. Then Pamuk wrote that he/Kemal wouldn't want the staff working in the museum to interrupt kissing lovers because this museum should always be open to those people who couldn't find anywhere else to make out. On the top floor of the museum, there was a line on the wall that said, ""Let everyone know, I lived a very happy life."" I didn't fully understand what that meant since I hadn't finished the book. Turns out this is the last sentence of the whole book. In the end Füsun died, Kemal developed another obsession with museums. Eventually he turned his own home into one in memory of her. I had mixed feelings for him like everyone else in the book, after he lost her again, when he was so damn close to marrying her. But then I realized it wouldn't matter anymore, would it? They got back together, and did, in fact, spend the rest of their lives together. Outsiders might see him as an obsessive, lonely, weird rich guy, but he enjoyed every minute of his life with Füsun in it, or just the memory of her. It's just beautiful.","Sep 15, 2017"
2871449,Katie,"The writing deserves more than three stars, but this is my rating, and not a rating of the prowess of Orhan Pamuk.. I read this novel in preparation for a trip to Turkey, and I think it taught me about Turkey, which was its main purpose. At the same time, though, I found the main character, Kemal, absolutely insufferable. I was so annoyed by him that I almost stopped reading at several points.. I have hated or been uncomfortable with protagonists before and continued the book. Kemal made it difficult because he was not a bad person, which, while infuriating to read, texturizes a book in a way that Kemal's unending, pathetic lovesick moaning does not. I get that he can't help himself and his feelings are sincere. That doesn't make them more enjoyable to read. There were whole 50-page stretches that I could sum up with ""He's still in love with her."". Google Chrome doesn't think ""texturizes"" is a word, I've just learned.. The other issue I had, which I won't go into detail about so that the idea is preserved for new readers, is that I wasn't sold by the ""dictation"" format. The jury's still out on the concept of the museum for me, although I like that Pamuk endeavored to create one in real life. I didn't find it distracting.. In the end, I felt like great writing was wasted on a pathological character, and while I can appreciate why it still might be important to tell that story, I didn't really want to listen.","May 23, 2013"

At first I felt as if I was having coffee with a close friend in which Kemal reveals intimate details of the love of his life developing into obsession. As our time together closes Kemal leaves his journal for me to peruse depicting his story of Fusun and their complicated and torrid romance.. This isn't your ""average"" love story by any means, be prepared for a few twists and turns leaving you awed as only Pamuk can pull off with ease.. Pamuk writes MOI in such an up close and personal style you feel yourself part of the story, intently reading to pick up every fine detail to try and comprehend this profound pronouncement of love. Very unique, at times frustrating but certainly not predictable. I enjoyed the story and found myself reflecting on the premise long after I finished reading.

22750176,Marva,"This is a prose Epic of love and longing. It encompasses the invisible connect between memories, fantasies and the affect of everyday mundane objects. I was as worn as the desperate but invincible lover, Kemal Bay as I was reading the book. But once I was nearing the climax, I could feel the depth of fathomless love engrained in words, collected crazily to the voluminous level of a museum. The Museum, the structure and the book are monuments of Life, of pleasure in dismay. I couldn't believe it was fiction, I googled many times for the real story, for the real people of this Turkish love story. That a writer, can so convincingly craft this long a piece of well woven fabric of fiction, of not merely few individuals, but that of an entire country, of an entire spectrum of time, generations, locale, yet not losing the idiosyncratic intricacies as well as the social and political nuances. Moreover, he has successfully worded the gender tensions entangled with the class conflicts. Once having read, one cannot contain the curiosity to visit the Museum.","Feb 05, 2017"
1132408,Meg - A Bookish Affair,"The Museum of Innocence is a novel of obsession and the things that we hold on to (sometimes without reason) to remind us of those situations.. Kemal is a young man in Turkey during the mid-1970s, a time of great change and modernization in the country. He's engaged to be married to Sibel. One day, he runs into Fusun, a distant relation, and falls in love with her and forms a relationship with her. Fusun is hurt by Kemal not breaking off the relationship with Sibel and leaves him. Kemal is then wrought with guilt and breaks his engagement with Sibel.. He then becomes absolutely obsessed with Fusun and begins collecting the most random things that he relates to Fusun and the time they shared (spoons that she has eaten from, etc.) Over the next several years, he strikes up a relationship with Fusun's family in order to get close to her.. I found it a little creepy about how long Kemal held onto his obsession but on the other hand, it's very human to hold onto the past sometimes.","Dec 08, 2009"
914730,Karen,"It is so hard to put into words my feelings about this book. I read it to the end even though there were times when I almost gave up. Strangely, I found it exceedingly interesting and exceedingly boring at the same time. What I most enjoyed about it was the occasional lighthearted humor, without which the book would have felt tortured. Additionally, the story would have lacked depth without the cultural context, setting, and time period in which it took place. I did really enjoy learning about a sub-culture of Turkish society which I knew nothing about. The main characters were ultimately pretty unlikeable to me (and at times insufferable), but some of the minor characters captured my attention: for example, both Kemal and Fusun's parents, Sibil and Zaim, and Cetin Efendi. Overall,I am glad I read this book, though I'm not sure how much I enjoyed it, and I would like to explore more of Pamuk's writing in the future.","Dec 19, 2010"
252768,Cristiana Lupu,"So... I rated it as 'it was ok', because I'm probably a bit too superficial to have ever loved this obsessively :) From this point of view, a lot of the narrative seemed expanded in time and space, without any context for me to compare it to. Yes, love is grand and it can be all too consuming, but since I am a leveled person myself, I could not comprehend the lengths the main character went to, and therefore considered him a bit too surreal. Although I am sure this can happen :) The novel offers however a romantic perspective on Turkey and Istanbul at a time when change happened. It also opens a window into the mindset of the people living at that time... and not only. And since I love romanticized history books and the like, I did find delight in the descriptions. Now I just have to get to Instanbul.

If I were still taking courses in literary analysis I’m sure I could write a thesis applying feminist criticism to this novel, and an incisive feminist approach wouldn’t be unfair, given Pamuk’s treatment of Fusun (yes, Pamuk, not Kemal). But, because I’m reading for pleasure I’m going to be an author’s reader, and simply say that I love Pamuk’s attention to objects, his unwavering romanticism for his city and his characters, and his charming and baffling habit of inserting himself and his previous characters into every novel.","Oct 11, 2009"

I must say that you made a very wise decision when you chose to let Mr. Pamuk catalogue your collection and let it serve as a chronicle of your life and memories, for not only did the museum bring your heart much needed solace, but it left all visitors with the realisation that one can never really lose a beloved, as long as they possess a trinket, a thought, a memory.","Feb 12, 2013"

But, of course you do finish it and realize that you just read one of the biggest testaments to love and belonging. Or, author's words that somehow tells all about it: ""Joy is simply that you are with someone that you love."". It's a thick book, full of small explanations and details and reading goes slowly. But it's well worth it. Truly makes you want to visit Istanbul. And this book should be on your list of tourist guides before that visit.

It's a story of a life-long love, unrequited for the vast, vast majority of that life.. Pamuk's narrative construction convinces the reader of the logic of the lead narrator, worryingly, because the lead narrator is a man who has lost his mind through love. You empathise with him, support him through his transgression and cowardice and double-crossing; you forgive him every single thing he does or says because he does it for love.. It's one of the saddest books I've ever read, and therefore one of the most cathartic. At the very end of the book, the narrator, whose life has been dominated by a love he can't possess, nor distance himself from, says how happy he is. It's indescribably moving.","Nov 26, 2016"

Something I should add is that no matter how long and unnecessary a chapter was, like his longing for her would go on on many chapters,it still didn't get boring.","Aug 30, 2017"
819818,Ferris,"I will never walk through a museum so blithely dismissing some of the seemingly trivial collections again! Another Orhan Pamuk work of genius. In this novel the reader works through the ""Museum of Innocence"" created by the narrator and protagonist, Kemal Bey. Is he obsessive? Passionate? Ludicrous? Pathetic? Noble? That is for each reader to decide. The major themes of this story about love include: Passion, obsession, loss, family, social expectations in Istanbul in the 1970s, cultural change and its impact in Istanbul, women's issues in Istanbul, and about how one can savor one's life through the minutiae all around us at all times. What an amazing writer!","Aug 19, 2010"
4741274,Kristy,"This is THE romance novel. Don't think I will ever read anything that compares but hope I do.. It wasn't sappy, goopy, goofy love. It was smart, cerebral love that somehow remained sensual. Wowza.. True devoted obsession and longing opposed to fleeting infatuation and premature endings.. Sounds like it could be a pitiful, broken record but it never got old. This guy often straight up lived in the past but he was living in deeply detailed beautiful moments. Lingering imprints. Fantastic!. What keeps it going is a lifetime of twists and turns all on the backdrop of 1960's Istanbul, a interesting setting to begin with. A must read!","Mar 06, 2011"

It's hard to describe in words how deeply moving, at times shattering, the Museum of Innocence is.. The themes this story explores are so deeply engrained in human nature that it would be almost impossible not to be moved by the characters' struggles, no matter who you are or what experiences you've had in life so far, you're more likely than not going to relate to most of the characters' thoughts, feelings and reactions to everyday life.. Pamuk is a genius like no other.","Dec 29, 2012"

And because he didn't recognize it for what it was, Kemel spends the next 9 years trying to recapture the happiness that he lost because he was blind to the gift he had been given. This book has moved me profoundly, not only because I read it while in Istanbul where the novel is set, but because it spoke so heartbreakingly of the little moments that we too often ignore, innocent of the gifts that those moments can be. And in two days I will visit the actual Museum of Innocence and I already know that it will wreck me!","Dec 01, 2015"
50013406,Sabina,"I loved this book.. Some reviewers have accused it of resembling a Turkish soap opera... Maybe they have failed to go a bit deeper - this book is the account of a troubled man. I do not want to spoil this for you but as the story draws to a close, I guess it is not only the beautiful and wretched love story that remains with us, but also the absurdity of the society and its norms; the inability even of lovers to communicate and understand one another, condemning each other and themselves to eternal loneliness.. This all sounds a bit heavy but this book is also an absolute treat, a beautiful homage to Istanbul and a truly great work of fiction by a very talented writer.","Dec 11, 2015"
18457735,তানজীর,"Probably for some romantic, and may be authentic, description of the old Istanbul (but you could have gotten it from some other book, couldn't you?), I reluctantly gave it 2 stars. Otherwise it never felt so much like a waste of time after reading a book by an author I was so keen to read. It was some excruciating pain to read through pages after pages of details of a middle aged man sitting through supper, uninvited, with a family of a young and married girl, and stealing things from their house. May be at a much younger age, I'd have loved the romantic aspects of that setup (would I?).. I am sure when I read Pamuk's other books, my evaluation of him will change. I hope.","Sep 19, 2016"
4066451,Maryanne O'Hara,"I have very fond memories of this book, more than a year after reading it. I was completely in the mind of Kemal, and I think Pamuk was right to give us those pages and pages of obsessed, mundane detail. (Kind of like how A.S. Byatt wrote all that poetry for. Possession. . It made all the difference.). Actually, as I recollect the book, and try to write a succinct line or two for a review, I am reminded of just how much mental effort is involved in writing a book like his.... Better to just read the book, think about it, then talk about it with a great group of reader friends.","Mar 03, 2012"

He is terrific at creating the depth of a character's situation and all the thought and background that makes them who they are. However, he does get carried away and this book really drags in the middle. THere is another theme here, beyond the story of lost virginity and what that means in the Turkish culture. And the obsession of one man with one woman. But I'm not sure what that other theme is exactly. But Pamuk is an intense story teller which saves this book to at least 3 stars.","Oct 29, 2012"

Kemel is almost creepy at times, Fusun bitter, and you wonder how they would have coped with long-term marriage. What would dull routine and very different aspirations have made of them?. In conclusion: it moved me quite deeply and I never got bored, but it would have moved me equally as much with fewer pages.","Jul 12, 2013"

The story is about a highly privileged man, living through a turbulent time for his country, who manages to sail through the turmoil, oblivious, completely consumed by his passion for a woman. This obsessive love is destructive, not just for him, but for many who are touched by it, and yet there is beauty salvaged from the mess. The writing is beautiful and though the journey seems so hopeless at times, bright sparks appear just when they are needed. The food is good, too......","Jul 20, 2014"

32413649,Timons Esaias,"This novel is difficult to evaluate in GoodReads terms, because it's really part of a two-book-plus-museum project, and I'd give five stars to the project. While I admire the craft of this novel, it was a long slog of a read for this consumer, and I've already found myself telling people to read Istanbul, or My Name Is Red, or The White Castle in preference to this one. (I've only just started the companion volume, The Innocence of Objects, which is looking to be a five-star work.). The book tells the tale of two failed romances experienced by Kemal, a rich brat in his 30s at the commencement of the story, and is set in Istanbul in the 1970s and 80s. Specifically it concentrates on the Nişantaşi, Beyoğlu, and Çukurcuma neighborhoods. The narrator is very attached to objects, and turns out to be something of a kleptomaniac, as well as a hoarder/collector, and so the description often focuses on the minor physical items of everyday life. Which means that this is a nostalgic trip to that place and era. Love that part of it.. The conceit of the novel is that Kemal has built a museum whose subject is both that time period, and his affair with his cousin, Füsun. Much of the museum consists of what would be called second-order relics of Füsun, including 4,213 of her cigarette butts. The narrator points the reader to the display items as he tells the story, as though one were physically in the museum with him. This reminds me of the layered narrative conceits of My Name Is Red, and I really liked the idea; especially since I own the book that pictures the museum, i.e. The Innocence of Objects. If you have read Pamuk's memoir Istanbul, you will see an extension of his fascination with that fascinating place. The time period is the era when Istanbul was just beginning to transition from a bedraggled and decaying wreck of a city to a modern Western powerhouse.. Another amusing element of the story is that Pamuk is a minor character in his own novel. Only at the end do we discover that he actually wrote it, at Kemal's insistence.. The problem with this novel is the main character, who has not a single redeeming feature, and who treasures memories above realities, and objects that have touched people over the people themselves. He's privileged, selfish, narcissistic, kleptomaniac, and a pig with women. He wrecks almost everything he touches. And he has a rather flat affect on the page, which flattens the reader's experience of the story.. It is true that the novel is well-constructed, and cleverly designed to let the reader see what the narrator refuses to; while we also misunderstand some of the main characters until nearly the end. We can be outraged at Kemal for taking the virginity of not one, but two women in his life, in a culture where that damages a woman for life; but only later do we find that his crimes only begin there. It is also true that there are two brilliant chapters in the thing: 69 ""Sometimes"" which is a prose poem capturing the mindset of the whole book, and 81 ""The Museum of Innocence"" which details the book's main metaphor, and makes it concrete, as it were. The several closing chapters are very effective.. But. But. The slog was a slog, and the clever chapters won my admiration, but not a reassessment of the novel. Is it a bitter medicine, making me want to cut out of my character anything that vaguely resembles Kemal, with a dull, white-hot knife? Yes. Does that redeem the pain of watching this equusafricanusasinusdepression live his destructive life?? Not hardly.. But here's a way of looking at the thing as a worthy project, perhaps. There is a kind of novel that is often brilliant, but which I loathe as a trope. I call it The Bitch Goddess Novel, in which a beautiful (usually) or powerful female character leaves a trail of destruction behind her, usually because she makes selfish (from the perspective of other characters) or impulsive choices. (Let us name, as examples, Madame Bovary, Laxdæla saga, Dr. Zhivago, the deplorable Gone with the Wind, and the incomparable Anna Karenina.) What I loathe about these books (even while adoring some of them at the same time) is that they tend to romanticize bad behavior, bolster misogyny, and undermine the very idea that women are human beings with the equal right to their own choices. On the other hand, I have known such women, so there's an underlying realism that should not be denied. And what this book is, I'm pretty sure, is the male role-reversal of that trope: It's a Bitch-Boy Novel.. I can definitely admire that, as a project.. A very mixed review from me, then. Respect, but not love. Admiration and intrigue, but not full approval. Three stars for the book, five for the idea, five for the project. Six stars for Istanbul.","Sep 12, 2019"
53509133,Moushine Zahr,"This is the first novel I've read from Turkish author Orhan Pamuk, but not the first Turkish author i've read. Throughout the novel I thought I was reading a fiction story until the last chapters when it is revealed that's actually a non-fiction biography of a real person. It still didn't change a thing about my opinion and review of the book.. Readers have a large choice of subjects treated in this novel: Istanbul society, relationships between a man and a woman, love, Time, memories,.... The novel could be divided into 3 parts:. - the first part, set in 1975, is about the leading male character, Kemal, born into a wealthy Turkish family from Istanbul, about to be engaged to Sibel, a woman, also born like him into a wealthy Turkish family from Istanbul, but lives with Fusun, an intense love and sexual relationship with an 18 year distant poor relative. In this part, the author offers to readers a personal and intimate description of the Wealthy society of Istanbul, how they made money, how they live, how they spend their money, their morals and values, their dilemna between living like Europeans inside a still consevative Muslim country. The author shows us how Kemal lived his relationship with his fiancee Sibel and how he lived his relationship with his lover Fusun prior to the engagement. This part bares similarities with many stories of Turkish films, gossip stories and is quite familiar with readers from around the world. However, what comes after is quite unique and unexepected.. - The second part, set during 8 years starting 1976, the author describes now intimately how the poor society of Istanbul lives inside their home, their daily routines, the few changes happening, the ever changing environment surrounding them while their lives are still the same. Furthermore, the book describes also the Turkish film industry. In this part, after one year of not seeing each other, Kemal ""reunites"" with Fusun under strict conditions and in a specific environment totally different from what they lived together in 1975.. - The last part, set after 1983, Kemal lives again a different life than before.. It is quite difficult to summarize the book's story as it is spans decades and has several changes. The leading character Kemal shows his love, passion, obsession to Fusun in various and different ways throughout decades.. The major obvious flaw of this book is that it is too long with too many sub-stories and too many descriptions. The major less obvious flaw of this novel, which is presented as a ""love"" story is that it gives only the version of the ""love"" story from Kemal's perspective and not from Fusun's perspective. Personnally, in this 'contemporary modern' era, I'am interested in reading love story's from both members of the couple and not just one of them.. Despite the fact that throughout the novel, the leading character Kemal sincerely believes he loves Fusun and wants to prove to himself, his lover Fusun, his family, his entourage, and the rest of the World, I wasn't convinced. First of all, I got tired to the repetitiveness of the same lamenting story. I believe Kemal was psychological disturbed due to the loss of the happiest time of his life in 1975 before the engagement. This loss entrapped him in a time period he had been wishing to live and relive again and again through many ways. It might have been a mutual love story in the beguinning, but not afterwards anymore. All the things he did throughout the years and decades, Kemal did it for himself and not for her. He never did anything specifically for her only and/or what she wanted to do without waiting anything in return. Thus, I don't call what he experienced love, but more like psychollogical obsession.. It is a great novel to read if you're curious about Istanbul's Society in 1970's, but while the personnal story of Kemal is unique with several twists, it is not as interesting as he thought it was.","Jun 10, 2019"
51872363,Miriam Cihodariu,"This was immersive as any Pamuk writing, fascinating for the world-building details, but deeply, deeply disturbing.. It took me a great while to read, I had to drop it and switch to other books and pick it up again and so on, precisely because it manages to be grating. The main character is a disturbed individual who insists on wrapping up his obsession as love, and who wishes to sell it as such to the object of his obsession and to the rest of the world as well.. I may be harsh - in truth, I think the author presents the matter as ambiguous. As readers, we are supposed to uncomfortably shift between being disgusted and sympathizing with Kemal's 'love'. But somehow, as a relatively young woman living in a country which is not too fond of respecting female boundaries, I was only receptive to the side of the story where we feel appalled.. The most disturbing fact is that the character is aware that what he is doing is not OK, somewhere just at the surface of his consciousness. Take this excerpt:. ""Of course, at the dinner table these looks of mine could never last longer than ten or twelve seconds, with my boldest attempt persisting for half a minute. Modern generations may well consider what I was doing as a form of harassment. Because by my insistent looks I was laying out on her family’s dinner table the intimacy, the love we had formerly shared, and which Füsun now wished to hide, or perhaps even forget."". Basically, Kemal is admitting that he insists on bringing up his feelings even while acknowledging that the lady wants to move on and forget that they had a thing. Her current feelings and what she wishes do not matter to him. Her discomfort or change of heart is irrelevant for Kemal. He feels different and therefore is entitled to rub it in her face lest she forget.. Also, his own mother wisely tells him that he should drop the claims to undying love because one cannot talk of love in the absence of real choice. In a culture where men and women cannot talk freely - she says - there can be no love. Men just jump at the opportunity whenever they imagine a woman may be remotely interested or available, without actually considering if they really like her in the first place, or if perhaps she is not comfortable with the interaction.. Otherwise, there are thankfully lots of other things going on in the book that make it wonderful to read. Glimpses of modern life in Istanbul, mentions of places I visited and loved there myself - they are all endearing and fascinating. Pamuk's ease and playfulness with forms and pretext are also delicious to read - he even appears as a character at times, in passing, only to become a more important character at the end, when Kemal asks him to write down his story. :). A bit I liked (and which probably everybody else quotes):. “No one recognises the happiest moment of their lives as they are living it. It may well be that in a moment of joy, one might sincerely believe that they are living that golden instant 'now', even having lived such moments before, but whatever they say, in one part of their hearts they still believe that a happier moment to come. Because how could anyone, particularly anyone who is young, carry on with the belief that everything could only get worse: if a person is happy enough to think he has reached the happiest moment of his life, he will be hopeful enough to believe his future will be just as beautiful.”","Sep 20, 2019"
98973047,Clara,"My main problem with this book was its excessive length to cover a rather thin plot. I don't think Pamuk's priority while writing this book was to develop a well-thought and interesting plot with character depth. Rather, I think he wanted to evoke the Istanbul from his youth by describing at length many of the objects that were common in Turkish households at the time, and with them the characteristics of the Istanbul bourgeoisie he himself belongs to. When reading the novel, it really seems like the plot was a secondary element to the writer, but for a reader who has never been in Istanbul, this is not the case. Therefore, I couldn't help but be bored during long stretches of the book where the attention is laid on objects and details of Istanbul, rather than the liveliness of its (potentially interesting) characters.. I was pulled in for the first 250 pages or so, where all characters are being introduced and a lot of tension arises from Kemal's affair with Fusun weeks before his engagement to Sibel. During this part, Pamuk introduces interesting aspects of Istanbul society, which can't seem to decide whether to be modern and European or to hold true to its own traditions. This is especially hard for women, which are burdened with the responsibility to remain virgins before marriage, but also called to emancipate themselves by neglecting this conservative idea.. Yet, after the engagement party, my interest in the book dropped steepily as it becomes centered on Kemal's obsession and suffering, while putting Sibel and Fusun's development in the background. From this point onwards, I was reading because I was hoping the end to make it worth it, but also that disappointed me.. Pamuk writes well, of course, and there are several chapters of the book which are interesting, in my opinion the ones that describe the different aspects of Istanbul society and how these affect the characters in the book. But at the end of the day I don't think I would've missed much by not reading it. I sure hope Pamuk's other books will be more of a pleasant surprise!","Jan 06, 2020"
55464407,Rahul Singh,"You can never go wrong with a Pamuk in your hands. He writes about the mundane in the most beatific and scenic way possible. The Museum of Innocence is a prose replete with metaphors. Pamuk delineates the society that is torn between the east and the west and the repetition of Bosphorus reminds us constantly of the discrepancies, for instance,a woman’s virginity before marriage is of no concern in the west but virginity of a woman is prized in the east before marriage and it is the yardstick to determine a woman’s reputation; Pamuk has shown this through his characters like Sibel and Füsun poignantly. At the same time he also shows how the east isn’t much different from the west when it comes to the status of women in general and the question on their character, how they are the weaker, submissive, culpable whether it is Füsun, or Sibel, or Emma Bovary, or Anna Karenina, or Lolita. Coming to the protagonist or narrator, Kemal, he is someone whom I had started to hate as he narrated his story. Honestly, you really can’t feel love or empathy for him, however, despite my apathy, a part of me went out for him and I kept wishing and hoping for him to achieve what he is pursuing. Pamuk left me wondering as to how should I feel for this man who deserves no empathy but you still end up crying for him and you still want him to get what he wants; I have rarely felt so for characters. What I liked most about Pamuk is he makes you literally feel, yes, he actually makes you feel the love, the pain, the longing, and the final emptiness that closes us all. The final touch, the way Pamuk ends his novel is noteworthy. I remember listening to a BBC podcast wherein he says that to every novel he writes he adds a personal touch to it to make the story feel at home and his own, and somehow connected to him. He has this clever way of bringing the story home, surely, I was touched by the end.","Jun 28, 2018"
600874,Ellen,"Before I give my opinion of the book, I have to be honest: I listened to the audio book version and couldn't wait for it to finish. At close to 20 hours, this was a very long book and I would have enjoyed it more had the editor been a bit heavier-handed.. My rating is a combination of the two ways this book can be understood. As a straight-forward story of a spoiled, self-centered man who becomes obsessed with a young woman he has a fleeting romance with, it was hard to take. The man professes to be madly in love with her, but unwilling to break of his engagement to another woman in order to marry her. He then spends the rest of his life pining for her. And yet, the reader never gets the sense that he sees the woman for herself. She is just an object to him, as is his fiance. Reading (or listening) to his self-pitying braying about the grief his love has brought him made me urge to slap him in the face, saying ""Get over yourself. This isn't love."" That book gets 1 star.. But on the other hand, this is a beautifully written story about a city and a society at a certain place in time. Pamuk captures the aura of the time and place beautifully, and the book can be understood as a commentary about the Turkish nation moving painfully from one world to another as modernity clashes with tradition. Nothing is clear cut, as the attitudes towards women, virginity and innocence are slower to change than the styles of clothing and amusements on the streets of Istanbul. This book rates 4 or perhaps even 5 stars.. Together, they average out to 3 stars. In conclusion, if you can stand a great many pages filled with minute details about a man's obsession, this book is worth reading.","Nov 25, 2019"
27415546,Christina,"Why is it that prestigious awards always go to works of art with little entertainment value. I wanted to finish this book because it was about Turkey and I was so ready to learn about Turkey, and I did learn about Turkey so Pamuk was successful as far as that goes. But then I realized I was hoping to learn about it from a less entitled vantage point so it became a sort of miserable, unrewarding read.. He did capture time. He did evoke frustration. But he did not really cut you any favors in his quest to do so. I felt I was being talked at. A deluge of facts, woven into the fabric of this Lolita-esque story of obsession. But I hate selfish characters if they are also condescending and proprietary. It’s not that I’m looking for happy endings but I felt that the book only aspired to be thorough. It talked just to talk. The thing about long meandering books is that at their end, like long relationships, we are scared to admit that they were not that good because out of respect for ourselves we want be convinced that time was not wasted, that there was something special enough for us to dedicate so much energy to it. Really, we only kept on bc we maybe had nothing better to do and were holding out hope it’d get better. That’s this book.. Just because we invest a lot of time in something doesn’t mean we should let ourselves be less harsh in its criticism. This book was too long. The story was uninspired. The writing lacked an addictive voice, despite being from the perspective of an addict. But it was thorough, so, bravo?. Edit: after some more thought...obsession is boring, circular thinking exhaustive and exhausting, so in that regard, the book is...accurate","Feb 10, 2019"
22548668,Beatrice Apetrei,"I hated this book. Better said, I hated the main character of this book. I literally could not stand him, nor could I understand his poor, troubled soul. *bad me*. This is my first Pamuk novel ever and I received it as a gift from someone dear to me, so I decided to stick to it and try to finish it even though I had many attempts of putting it aside.. Overall, it was not a bad book, but I disliked a lot of the characteristics it came with - genre, characters, etc. This would not be the kind of book I would pick up in a bookshop, at all.. The writing is, truth be told, quite impressive. I could, at times, emphasize with Kemal or understand him. It let me travel inside his mind and get the motifs behind his actions.. The problem was with the plot itself and the character's decisions. As the hopeless romantic I am, I hated what he did to Sibel and how he played both of the girls for his own pleasure. And again, how did he fall in love with Fusun? He would sleep with her and help her study, that's their time together summed up. I am not even exaggerating. He became obsessed with the image of Fusun, as he thought of her, rather than her actual self.. But he stays obsessed for years?! And he goes and has dinner with her and her husband? How...? I could go on and on about some unrealistic, or better said, impossible to understand acts of his, but it would not fit the available field.. And the ending was extremely predictable, especially for me. I saw it coming instantly. It couldn't have been in any other way. It's the only thing that saved the book for me.. Do I recommend this book? I'm not sure. Maybe if you are into self-centered narcissists.. Try it at your own risk.","Mar 04, 2019"
105874128,Merel,"2.5/5. I was gifted this book before my trip to Istanbul, but did not have the chance to read it before my trip. I visited the Museum of Innocence and was impressed by the amount of objects and I have to say, the objects conveyed certain emotions. I enjoyed a quote about Time, stating that we must treasure our time for its deepest moments. For Kemal, that was spending 8 years at his beloved Füsun's dinner table.. I finally got to read the book and I enjoyed the passages about Istanbul, the culture, the influence of the West, and the tidbits of history. Reading about the city and certain neighborhoods made me relive my trip to Istanbul, it made me remember all the small but precious moments. As Pamuk wrote about certain streets in Beyoglu I also imagined myself walking there again.. On one side, the story kept piquing my interest and on the other side I skipped or skimmed entire passages. Some chapters are very long-winded and not interesting. The writing is too detailed. For the parts that were interesting, I did enjoy the writing. I read a Dutch translation of the book and I think it was translated well.. I think someone who hasn't visited Istanbul would not get a lot of enjoyment out of this book. It's too longwinded, it did not satisfy me, and I find that Kemal was a sad man, to say the least.","Dec 24, 2019"
84930251,Stéphanie Harel,"The dreamy scenes of life in Istanbul sucked me right in. When I began reading this novel I was in the mood for a story washed in slow reverie and gentle romance, seeped in a foreign city’s culture. I despise museums so the endless details of Kemal Bey’s collection of things throughout the book and the laborious encounters of the refuge he sought in inanimate objects at the Mehmet apartment bored me. Still, I carried on. The dreamy rhythm of the book carried me to the very end. The irony and paradox for me was Kemal Bey’s incredible persistence and superhuman patience to win Fusun, the love of his life, whilst simultaneously being oblivious to her biggest dream. His undeterred focus to be with her, along with his meticulous attention to detail, blinded him from seeing what she truly wanted in life. In the end, he learnt in the most tragic way, by her suicide, that her unrequited dream of becoming an actress dwarfed Kemal’s relentless patience and sacrifice to win her heart. Orphan Pamuk taking the pen in his own voice at the end of the book gave end to Kemal’s excruciating lament, a master stroke at work.","Jan 10, 2020"
33592940,Anirban Nanda,"If you are into the first 100 pages, getting hooked and thinking the book will be like this all throughout, you are very wrong. This is not a book to be finished in one sitting. This is a book about obsessive love that can become boring at times, reading the same lovesick description of Fusun for pages after pages. But it is so very beautiful. Kemal's love for Fusun is intimately mixed with Istanbul and its people. Pamuk is able to bring out a very convincing character of Istanbul which gets its culmination at the end of the book, during the establishment of The Museum of Innocence. The museum is not a collection of Fusun in memory, but the collective life of people living in Istanbul at that time. Kemal's tryst to remember Fusun mingles with remembering Istanbul. And this is what makes this book different from other stories of obsessive love. Pamuk used self-aware narration nicely to give the end a faraway third person feeling even though the entire book is in close first person. Highly recommended. Patience is advised.","Jul 20, 2019"

Repetitiveness of his tryst with a girl leading to the development of a museum of innocence? What? Such mundane emotions, physical attracyion, obsession over nothingness, the girl is not even a blessed sweet lady material, a sex goddess maybe... I just dont get it. As I told my kids, I just have to finish the book hopefully to find the gem somewhere within, albeit most of the time, something like every couple of pages, I totally feel like throwing up. Repulsive is not even strong enough a word. Crazy piece this is. And museum of innocence indeed ? More like a zoo of lost souls.","Nov 24, 2018"
31824821,Paul Lemcke,"Summaries I’ve read tout this as an enduring story of an obsessive love. I saw it more as a one-sided obsession by a privileged alcoholic with serious mental health issues. He calls it love, but it looks more like lust. His business decisions and personal decisions are driven but this obsessive lust, and he suffers their consequences again and again. Kemal claims to understand Fusun’s deepest thoughts which always result in Kemal’s belief that she loves him, or at least will love him again. I would be interested to hear the story from Fusun’s perspective as I believe it would reveal Kemal’s folly. The Museum was such an interesting idea throughout the story, but I can only see it as a creation of a deranged person.","Jun 17, 2019"

12016531,Pranjal,"I want to start my review by saying that the way you feel about a book or a story is largely a factor of your personality, choices, phase of life, expectations.. I have read Orhan Pamuks ""My name is red"" and it set the benchmark too high.. This book is nothing like, My name is red and far from it in terms of story line and writing style.. The protagonist, Kemal, young, educated in America, belonging to a rich business Turkish family of Istanbul is soon to be engaged to Sibel, who is his equal in lifestyle and status, in 1975 Istanbul . One day Kemal meets his distant step cousin, 18 year old Fusun at a shop and is drawn to her. They soon develop a secret relationship while preparations for Kemals engagement are underway. Kemal is entangled in the two relationships but slowly and steadily, Fusun is all he ever thinks about.. The story is about Kemal and Fusun. In his obsession for Fusun, he starts collecting objects related to Fusun, anything and everything that reminded him of her, and eventually memorabilia from all the places he lived at, visited or spent time at while he thought of Fusun. All of these objects make the Museum of innocence.. Museum of Innocence is as much about Kemal and Fusun as it is about Istanbul. The author has captured Istanbul, in 1975 and following years in great detail, including but not limited to the society, culture, gossips, fashion trends, movies, restaurants, streets, food, liasons. I'm sure it'd be such a revelation to someone who has lived in Istanbul for an extended period of time.. The writing is detailed but painfully so. As a reader, I felt it lacked depth, also because everything is being narrated to us from Kemals perspective.. I couldnt relate to Kemal at any point and found him entitled, spoilt with no real struggle in his life without depth, and thus was left feeling annoyed and disappointed as the story progressed.. I feel the time and generation I'm from, I couldnt find love in the relentless pursuit of a girl.. 500 something pages and i was disappointed . Again not every book is for everyone.","Aug 05, 2020"
4716806,Mike,"I've been going back and forth on what rating to give this novel -- vacillating probably between the five I eventually settled on, and probably something more like a three or even a two (I am listening to the Mountain Goats and therefore in a good mood, which broke the tie towards the high end). The thing is, it's quite a good novel, with two significant flaws: 1) it can edge a bit towards the melodramatic, and 2) at times it can be quite uncomfortable to read. And by ""at times,"" I more or less mean the last 300 pages.. Before getting into those flaws, I should start out by saying that there's clearly a lot to enjoy here. Pamuk's prose is up to the task of framing the transports of love and the squalor of Istanbul in the same paragraph, and there's able character work on offer -- even though the narrator is frequently oblivious to what's going on in the other characters' heads, Pamuk doesn't let that confusion extend too far to the reader. There's a strong sense of place, and when the narrative is moving (it often stops for extended periods), it's surprisingly taut.. But with that said, very quickly the reader begins to figure out that something is up. This requires going into a bit of the plot (some spoilers here, though mostly nothing you couldn't suss out by reading the table of contents): our narrator starts out engaged, then meets not-quite-cute with a young, attractive distant relation, and commences an affair (I think the traditional adjective in this context is ""torrid""). Things go about how you expect, with both engagement and affair coming to ends that are drawn-out and pathetic, respectively.. So far so Updike, but after this, the young lover gets married, and the narrator starts spending every available moment with her and her family, including her new husband, giving off a vibe that's not exactly stalkerish only to the extent that it's not quite clean enough. The book at this point begins alternating narration of small incidents within this framework (which lasts for about eight years!), and more lyrical reflections on the nature of love and memory from our obsessed narrator -- including the kleptomanic collection of his beloved's possessions, which populates the exhibits of the titular museum.. Maybe I am oversensitive to this sort of thing due to peculiarities of personal history, but by any measure this is an intensely bad scene, and it goes on and on and on. The narrative bits make you squirm both on behalf of and because of the narrator, and the more philosophical bits can feel overblown and repetitive. The narrator's completely obsessed state means that every single small incident gets magnified in its awkwardness, and sends him into transports of emotion that are very hard to take seriously.. Those are the negatives, and they're very real. Ultimately, though, I think they're not just forgivable but in fact part of what makes the novel work, over and above all the craftsmanlike virtues I cite above. Because the thing is, Pamuk's succeeded at painting a very vivid portrait of what a person wholly in the throes of passion is like; the claustrophobic half-mad monomania is the whole point of the exercise, and for all that the grand guignol prose occasionally seems to overreach, it's the sort of overreach that plausibly would be going on in the narrator's head. For all that the narrator surrenders himself to sentiment, Pamuk's portrayal is rarely sentimental -- it's clear exactly how broken and unpleasant the tide of emotion has made the narrator, which makes for a compelling, unsparing portrait.. It's strong stuff, and well-done, but I wasn't quite sold on the book until pretty much the very end. With about twenty pages to go, the narrative voice shifts, and Pamuk begins to lay out the objective view of the narrator we've so far only caught in glimpses, confirming that yes, he's basically been an abject creature for a good long time now. Nothing too surprising here -- it's brutal, but also a bit welcome, since being stuck in the narrator's head for 500 pages leaves you feeling ready for the guy to be judged.. Except then Pamuk self-consciously pulls a nice bit of jujitsu, by allowing the narrator the last word to insist that yes, all of this is true, he's not stupid, but for all the wreck he's made of his life and the lives of others, he was and remains indescribably happy. It's a claim that could be easy to dismiss, but I think Pamuk does manage to sell it, making the misery and joy into a single unitary thing. The narrator remains narcissistic and unlikeable, but the novel ultimately winds up suggesting that that's a necessary consequence of experiencing and maintaining such extremes of feeling, and doesn't judge that as completely unworthy.. As a result, love, passion, fidelity, and all those other praiseworthy abstractions don't come out looking very good by the end. But the ending manages to elevate all the pettiness, misery, and melodrama of the rest of the novel and turn it into something incredibly compelling, in an amoral sort of way (sort of like a Mountain Goats song, now that I think about it). And I'm not sure what more you'd want a work of art to do.","Jan 07, 2011"

1627591,Robert,"The Museum of Innocence by Orhan Pamuk. The Museum of Innocence is about Kemal, in his thirties and engaged, falling in love with and seducing his distant cousin, age 18, named Füsan. This occurs in the 1970s in Istanbul when “European” customs and morals were not commonly accepted. Kemal’s fiancé Sibel has been to Europe (meaning Paris) and without intervening in his questionable activities goes through with a major engagement party at the Hilton. In theory this commits them to one another once and for all, leaving Füsan out in the cold. Sibel, however, comes to understand that going through with marriage to Kemal is not a very good idea. So she sends him back his engagement ring. Rich as Croesus or not, Kemal isn’t worth her time.. What is Kemal to do? He really loves Füsan, and he’s not that sorry to see Sibel go, but where the devil is Füsan? First, her parents rescue her from social opprobrium by arranging that she marry a not very promising filmmaker, and then they move to an obscure part of the city to keep their daughter away from Kemal. But Kemal finds them, eventually, and for eight years he follows the custom of visiting them for dinner because they are vaguely his relatives. And all the while he’s stealing little objects from their apartment, objects which he hides in his own little hideaway apartment, developing the beginnings of the collection that will become, in time, The Museum of Innocence.. Anyway, Füsan’s marriage falls apart, and Kemal, fixated on her, finally gets her to agree to a divorce so that the two of them can marry. But en route to Paris as part of their engagement celebration, Füsan reveals what she really thinks of Kemal for having ruined both their lives--she drives directly into a tree, killing herself and almost killing him.. Too bad he lives because he is a narcissistic self-indulgent romantic whom Pamuk obviously wants us to like but is basically infantile and worthless and not redeemed in the least by his Proustian fixations, his theories of memory, his fetishism, or his final passage through thousands of museums all over the world, studying them in preparation for launching The Museum of Innocence which will celebrate the intimate life of his beloved Füsan.. This is a powerfully stupid novel by a Nobel prize winner. It becomes even more stupid when Pamuk, who appears earlier at Kemal’s engagement party, returns to reveal that he has been the “I” writing Kemal’s story for him--a touch of pointless post-modernism that rivals the dumb idea of The Museum of Innocence itself.. At the very end of the novel, Pamuk provides two separate sets of dates during which he wrote this ode to his fantasies. I take it he had trouble getting it going, set it aside, and unfortunately returned to finish it.. I am no expert on Pamuk or Turkish writing, but I do know that his “brand” is being fascinated by Istanbul as Balzac was with Paris, Dickens with London, and Naguib Mahfouz, an infinitely more profound and penetrating novelist than Pamuk, with Cairo.. My impression, because many scenes and minor characters are strong, is that Pamuk badly, badly needed an editor to shorten this novel by a third, throw out The Museum of Innocence idea, and push Kemal into realizing what a predatory shit he is. Füsan really doesn’t come alive until she tries to kill them both, but when she does, she’s great. Her anger soars when she puts her foot on the floor and hits that tree. It’s tragic that Pamuk didn’t understand the obvious: almost any reader (other than the writer himself) would rather have seen this novel conclude with her alive and Kemal smashed to bits.. In the odds and ends department, I’d conclude with this observation: Kemal refers to being drunk so many times over so many years that it is difficult to believe he doesn’t become his own alcoholic self-revelation while he is sitting around, waiting for Füsan’s doomed marriage to fail. I’d venture a hundred nights or more are referred to as being surrendered to alcohol, gallons of it, but the horror of such abuse, the kind of degradation that Malcolm Lowry explored in Under the Volcano, is absent here. There’s a headache or two, or a day’s work missed, but what does it matter when Daddy left you the company?. And as a final comment, I’d answer the question you may already be asking: why did I finish reading The Museum of Innocence if I hated it so much? The possibilities are multiple, but the basic answer is that I hoped Pamuk would find his way out of the morass he was creating. Nope, he was so wedded to Kemal’s narcissism that it sank him. A feeble pirouette of post-modernism and irony at the end arrive too late to save this novel from disaster.","Mar 11, 2014"

76563540,Anurag,"A couple of years back, when I was still a college student, I travelled back home by train. In India, we have two tiers of train coaches: reserved (further divided into sleeper class, 3rd AC, 2nd AC, 1st AC, chair cars, and maybe something else I'm forgetting) and unreserved. The unreserved class is for sitting; you don't get a whole berth for yourself to sleep, not like normal people anyway. They are hella cheap though, so a lot of people prefer travelling through them. This is one of the few places where you can find an assortment of people as unique as India can be. Saintly people who offer seats to those who've been standing for hours in a coach literally jam packed with people, and scums who scream at kids for bumping into them while sleeping, you can find both extremes frequently in these coaches.. As I was saying, during my journey back home, a man was perched on the upper berth (the unreserved class has two levels of berth; one lower to sit on, and one upper to keep your luggage at), telling his story to an elder lady, also sitting on the opposite upper berth. The man was one of the scums of the earth, the kind who would disregard any respect for anyone in favour of getting his way. He droned on and on till 3 in the morning (and only because we arrived at his destination at 3), shouted and berated us all when one of the unwitting listeners of the story politely asked him to shut the f#&k up (no really, he asked politely), and almost slapped a poor kid who in his sleep had nudged his holy butt with his tiny, insignificant leg. He was, I believe in modern (at the time of writing this; internet culture will surely forget this term soon enough I'm sure) parlance, a Ken/Kevin/whatever you guys call a male Karen.. You're still here? Good, I promise this is relevant to the review.. So, he drones on and on about his life story, about how he fell in love with a girl, how that girl was not worthy of his pure and lofty love, how he was broken beyond repair, and how he picked himself up and put himself back again to rise like the magnificent phoenix that he was (not that. he. actually used the term phoenix; that's too eloquent a term for a troglodyte that he was).. The thing is, his story was a dumpster fire, self-congratulatory in its ferocity, and malodorous in its essence. And yet, and yet, no one was able to peel themselves off from that. Everyone's ears were perked up, as he went on and on about his greatness, his tenacity, his 'struggles', we sat there, eagerly lapping up that acidic vitriol (that wasn't redundant I hope).. The Museum of Innocence. forced me to remember that man and his story, because it was just that: a dumpster fire I was unwilling to peel away from. I can't believe I'm saying this, especially after dragging myself by my male reproductive parts on a gravel road to finish all of its 728 pages, but the whole book, with very few, small exceptions, extremely bad.. I picked up this book in a book fair (Asia's largest), solely because it was written by Orhan Pamuk, the man who had put Turkey on the literary world map. I've heard of this man from various sources, one of them being a favourite teacher from college, and naturally, I was curious about his stories.. I should've read the summary before buying. I feel duped.. Now, I admit I'm not a romantic of any sort. I'm the guy who cringed all the way through. P.S. I Love You. movie, and laughed aloud at. La La Land. (and ruined the movie for my poor brother who was watching it with me). Even with that disability, I still think my words have some merit when I say that this story was not about love, or anything that's good or sane in this world.. Kemal was, to put it in my politest terms, a dick. He falls in 'love' with Fusun, because... legs. He then proceeds to have lots of steamy sex with her, and continuously drifts off into a reverie of sorts. While the reveries were interesting and insightful, at least to me, a simple virgin uninterested in people and relations, the basis of the relation was wonky at best. Kemal never once considers Fusun's feelings, taking her coming to his apartment as the only affirmation of the 'love' they share.. This might've been okay. Like I said, I'm not a romantic, and I don't really understand love and how people fall for someone. It's possible to be in love with someone and not understand it, at least that's what I've been told all my life. What I found really unforgivable was Kemal's obsession after Fusun ghosting him, both as a story element and a character trait. There are stretches of narratives going. way. too deep into his 'sadness', a lot of which could've been edited out without lessening the impact of his depression. In fact, I believe this over-description was what caused me to loathe the man, as the whole matter was one of stupidity and of doubling down on it. There are also a lot of other insignificant details, like the whole engagement chapter, which was filled with people and even a subplot which were of little or no consequence at all.. The most vile part however, the one which killed the story for me was Kemal's kleptomania disguised as 'love'. No matter what his justifications were at the end, it still doesn't take away the fact that he was not in love with Fusun, and all that stealing items (which he sometimes contradictorily softened with euphemisms, only to describe it as stealing later) was just him being pathetic for the sake of revelling in his patheticness. The proud ending describing his mania as a demonstration of his 'love', and a twisted justification of opening a museum of this memorabilia, doesn't help his case at all.. Throughout the novel, there is no redeeming quality for which I could at least tolerate Kemal's moronic ideals. He breaks his engagement with a very patient and wonderful woman, screws up his company (and yet manages to be rich somehow), drowns himself in. raks. (and yet never suffers any health-based consequences; yes I'm nitpicking now), distances himself from his friends, and tries to live his life enveloped in a falsehood, and yet he presents himself as a martyr. A mother-effing martyr. His 'sadness', his realisation of the world's 'oneness', his condemnation of his rich friends and their shallow lives, nothing evokes any sympathy, as everything he does is driven by an unhealthy obsession which would knock some sense in Severus Snape. The man keeps on being an unrepenting douche, thinking not of his father at his funeral, but of the possibility that Fusun might show up, among other continuously errant thoughts.. Now, there are good sections in the novel, don't get me wrong. The descriptions of Istanbul was very well done, and there were some thoughtful writing worth pondering over (not the Aristotle time thing though, that was just contrived BS). It was also interesting to see parallels between the Turkish society and my own, like our obsession with romantic movies and sports (football for them, cricket for us), our contradictory societal stance over things, and the conflict between our traditional values and the newly introduced Western ideologies. These pockets of good however, are overshadowed by Kemal's 'love', rendering them just a drab part of a madman's raving, and not the oasis they could've been.. I have a habit, and I'm sure my fellow bookworms have it too, of drifting off into the fictional world I've been reading about. If it's a war story, I'll find myself somewhere on the battlefield, seeing the madness unfurl. If it's a character-driven story, I. become. that character. If it's porn... no wait, never mind that.. For this story however, I never once felt part of it, and the vice-versa didn't happen either. I never dreamt of the Istanbul so vividly portrayed, or of the people in the story. I forgot about everything about the story as soon as I put down the book, my only lingering emotion being that of irritation, flowing within me like a black blob of jelly, disregarding any circulatory paths within me. Even now, I can scarcely remember major parts of the story, or even the parts that I found annoying during the time I was reading it. Even. Wolf Hall. , which I didn't enjoy as much as I could've because of my lack of historical background needed to fully appreciate the book, took me gently by hand and immersed me in the life of Thomas Cromwell, and in the dank environment of 16th century pandemic-infested London. There also was the sacrilegious thought of 'I could've written this better', particularly for the use of Aristotelian concept of time as a metaphor. Both of these feelings were new to me, something I never even considered I'd feel or even think of. In that aspect at least, this book was special.. Tl;dr:. This book was a hot dumpster fire, something unworthy of looking at. My second star to this is solely because of those small pockets of descriptions, and a couple of memories it reminded me of (not just the one I opened this review with), and definitely not because of any redeeming qualities of the story itself. How was it even published in its current form is a story I'd really love to read. I'd also love to know what qualities people who rated it 5 stars found in the book. Their reviews certainly fail to address the source of their adulation.. I hope this review was not as hot a dumpster fire as the book. If it was, I sincerely apologise for wasting your quanta of Aristotelean time. Thanks to everyone who endured me bitching about the first book I disliked this intensely.","Sep 16, 2020"

I went for 4 stars just because I read this book after I had seen him speak at an event in London (Southbank Centre), and he was so incredibly adorable that even when I was slightly annoyed with the book, I enjoyed it. Basically, the book is pretty unrealistic, and usually I don't like obsessive characters, but there was enough that I am interested in (and the memory of Pamuk's cuteness) to keep me reading. I thought the way he wrote himself into the book at points was pretty contrived, as if he is an old-school novel sometimes using the seemingly contrived devices of new-school writers like Eggers, etc. On the other hand, I haven't made it through other Pamuk novels, and I liked this one. The book seems to have been well translated, and the book is endearing and clearly from someone who loves (loved) Istanbul and Turkey and has a lot he wants to say about the Turkey he left. In that way, it's very exile literature, but I can identify with that to a degree.. ------------- FAVORITE QUOTES -------------.

6221395,Noorhaina,"Throughout the course of reading The Museum of Innocence, I developed mixed feelings towards Kemal, the protagonist. Please note that as I express my intense disapproval or other emotions, I will most likely give away some plot points by accident.. To summarise the story, Kemal is a rich young man who is struck dumb with love to a point where he can't seem to function like a normal person anymore. The problem was that he was engaged to be married to someone else. And I hated him for it. I hated how he dragged it on without any prolonged sense of guilt or remorse for how it affected everyone around him. It bothered me so much how this person who has the world at his feet could abandon responsibilities because he couldn't get this woman out of his head.. I suppose this review sounds like it's coming from a bitter woman who was jilted or had her heart broken by lots of men. Not true, although I've had my share of terminated relationships. I just find it distasteful that someone born in privilege gets to wallow in self-indulgent behaviour his entire life.. When it seemed like he was close to winning back his lover, I began to hope for her death, just for the satisfaction of knowing that all those years he spent trying to possess her (yes, to me that was what he wanted all along, but we'll come to that) will be for naught. The satisfaction was temporary, however, because for whatever reason, as Kemal/Orhan narrated his journey in the ensuing decades to museums large and small all over the world, I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness for Kemal. He was like a lost soul, trying to recapture a moment of happiness, and he wished the world to know that despite what anyone who had known him would say, despite how they perceived him since falling fatally in love, that he knew a certain happiness, and that visitors to his Museum of Innocence would be able to understand and experience the same kind of happiness encapsulated in his collection.. I did enjoy how much Kemal/Orhan's narration created a rich imagery of Turkey of decades past. The novel is set in the 70's and 80's, and while it touched very little on the political upheavals of the time, the social landscape in the descriptions of the neighbourhoods, weekend activities, and the local film industry provided glimpses into the politics of the nation. The collection described in the Museum of Innocence itself is a rich catalogue of an era long past. That Orhan Pamuk has actually recreated the Museum, which is now open, is absolutely exciting and I am keen to pay a visit and compare the contents to Kemal's curated possessions.. Which brings me to the point of the items Kemal collected and his attitude towards her. I can feel myself getting upset all over again. At the beginning, Kemal's habit of collecting things that belonged or reminded him of his love, Füsun, seemed only unusual. But the longer it went on, the worse it became, as he resorted to pocketing items from her family's house, including thousands of cigarette stubs and kitchen utensils!. It dawned on me that while Kemal believed that he did it out of undying love, I felt that more than anything, he wanted to possess her. This became evident to me when he engineered to keep her away from the career she wanted for herself. Love wouldn't drive someone to do such things, but the desire to claim ownership and possession would. He perceived Füsun as a lovely object that gave him happiness, but he rarely talked about making her happy. Because he was unable to possess her and keep her behind a glass display cabinet, preserved for his pleasure to view and appreciate however he wished, he gathered everything that would preserve his memory of her instead.. I guess we're back to the hate. What a roller-coaster of emotions! I suppose I have Orhan Pamuk to thank for that.","Sep 06, 2011"

The dude was a total creep who was not worth anyone’s time. But the writing, the attention to detail, and the style of narration were really good. I wouldn’t recommend this book to anyone as a first Orhan Pamuk book, but if you’ve read another of his (i loved snow) and liked the writing and narration style, this is enjoyable at times (and cringy and off-putting at others). mostly tho, it was just way too long. 50-100 pages could have been cut. we get it, you're sad.","Jul 27, 2020"
4983189,Priyadarshini Sur,"Orhan Pamuk’s novel ‘The Museum Of Innocence ‘Or ‘Masumiyet Muzesi’arouses the reader’s desire to visit the city of Istanbul as well as the museum ,Pamuk created inspired by the novel. The novel is not only the story of star-crossed lovers but also an ode to Pamuk’s love for Istanbul.. The novel chronicles the story of an upper class playboy Kemal who falls desperately in love with his distant cousin Fusun,a shop girl.Marriage is out of question as the social gap is too wide. And Fusun has been tainted in that she has surrendered her virginity to Kemal knowing fully well he will never marry her.In the book Pamuk talks about the attitude of people of Istanbul towards women in 1970’s & 80’s,which he describes as an unpalatable truth in Ch- 15 . “One thousand nine hundred and seventy-five solar years after the birth of Christ, in the Balkans, the Middle East, and the western and southern shores of the Mediterranean, as in Istanbul, the city that was the capital of this region, virginity was still regarded as a treasure that young girls should protect until the day they married. Following the drive to Westernize and modernize, and (even more significantly) the haste to urbanize, it became common practice for girls to defer marriage until they were older, and the practical value of this treasure began to decline in certain parts of Istanbul. Those in favor of Westernization hoped that as Turkey modernized (and in their view, became more civilized) the moral code attending virginity would be forgotten, along with the concept itself. But in those days, even in Istanbul ’s most affluent Westernized circles, a young girl who surrendered her chastity before marriage could still expect to be judged in certain ways”. The way Kemal and also Fusun’s husband manipulates he desire to become a movie star is also a reflection of society’s attitude to women.Their reaction to fusun is to get close to her and soon as that happens ,they wish o control her. Fusun says “You two were so jealous, so afraid I might find fame and leave you that you had to keep me at home .”the more Kemal loves Fusun,the more he wants to suppress her and to possess her.The earring which Fusun wore the first time they mado love was the same which she wore the last time they made love and both the times it was not noticed by Kemal.. “You didn’t even notice the earring, “she said.. “What earring?”. Dangling from her right ear was the lost earring. Had she been wearing it while we were making love?. Could I have missed such a thing?”. Orhan Pamuk describes how Kemal collects his lover’s belongings and sets them up in his museum.It ‘s a book about memory, lost desperate love, obsession. The novel and the museum go together.The book is laid out in 83 chapters and so is the museum.In chapter 5 “Fuaye, he exhibits an illustrated menu,an advertisement,a match book and a napkin from Fuaye ,one of the European style restaurants.In chapter 68 ,Pamuk writes that Kemal was able to squirrel away 4213 of Fusun’s cigarette butts during his eight years of going to the Keskins for supper. Kemal has visited 5,723 museums in the world before he sets up his own museum.Those who have read the book enjoy free admission to the museum .A ticket is placed in every copy. According to Pamuk museums are not be strolled around in but to be experienced and are made up of collections expressive of the soul of that experience.. The book gives a slice of life Istanbul of 1980’s and its society.","May 28, 2012"
21321371,Jean-michel Boudreault,"The Museum of Innocence is a tale of wrenching heartbreak and unrelenting emotional agony. I would imagine this to be a book that a lot of readers give up on at some point, with its lengthy and detailed elaboration of one man’s indefatigable obsession with a much younger woman. But the book has a certain anthropological quality to it which some readers will be drawn to, a thick description of all the physical and contextual triggers affecting a man (Kemal) hopelessly caught in the grip of a cruel, unwavering passion. Readers will on the one hand feel sorry for Kemal in his predicament, but on the other they might envy the otherworldly power and intensity of his love for another (Füsun).. That said, Kemal seems to be afflicted with an impossibly rare form of lovesickness which some readers might find tedious and unrealistic. In this book we are witness to an extreme form of yearning that is as unlikely as it is unendurable. Kemal’s agony, which is the sort of emotional pain and suffering that we all experience to some extent in our lives, extends in his case far beyond reason and well into grotesque exaggeration. The reader is relieved not to be in Kemal’s shoes, yet somehow is intrigued by the impossible depth of his misery.. Orhan Pamuk’s simple and unpretentious prose accentuates Kemal’s steady yet unfathomable descent into a sentimental abyss. Kemal’s story is told in the first person, such that the reader is locked into Kemal’s mind, hopelessly subject to the ebb and flow of his psychological torment, like a shipwreck survivor trapped in a safety boat in the middle of the tumultuous ocean. Despite his unusual behavior, Kemal appears from the inside to be perfectly reasonable in his thinking. Readers will find no comfort in this rich and successful businessman succumbing so severely to emotional injury.. Kemal’s passion for Füsun is far-fetched, but the sincere meaning he finds in the ordinary objects of her belonging serves as an apt critique of thoughtless modern consumerism. As portals to the past, the things once possessed by those dear to us, although perhaps worthless in the monetary sense, may enrich our lives immeasurably by providing direct pathways to memories and feelings that might otherwise fade over time. We can’t be hoarders, but we can at least try to preserve some of the things that connect us to that which is historically significant on a personal level.. Further to this, Kemal’s idea of a personal museum is both worthy and endearing; readers will relate to his endeavor and experience through it their own personal solace with regards to his heartbreaking story. As Kemal explains, “real museums are places where Time is transformed into Space.” Indeed, Time is that which interferes with our direct access to the meaningful events of the past. Hence, the point of collecting these single moments (“like Aristotle’s atoms – indivisible, unbreakable things”) and organizing them in a common space, as Kemal does, is to negate the distancing effect of time and return everything to the present. Readers will be enlightened to learn from this story that time as such does not exist, that it is merely a system of measurement and that we should think of the past not as time elapsed, but rather as a sequence of meaningful events to be cherished and relived in the moment..

870557,Emily,"Orhan Pamuk’s The Museum of Innocence can be read a hundred different ways despite the fact that he explains at the end that he intends us to view it as a catalog of the eponymous museum. Its fictionalized desperate plea to be viewed as relevant and important serves to underline its true value—not as a listing of objects and events that combine to describe a true love, or even a warning cry against increasing lunacy and dark obsession, but as a mirror of our own obsessions and deliberately false assignations of meaning to propriety and immorality, the trappings of a culture or a country or a life.. My favorite parts of The Museum of Innocence are the references to time. The Keskal family’s clock smiled benignly and uselessly down on the family through years of immobility, ticking along or not but having no effect on the activities it oversaw. The clock itself, in its familiarity, serves as a further accessory to the total absence of movement in their lives, chronological or otherwise. Kemal in fact declares that we use clocks and watches not to know what time it is or to order our own lives, but as a medium to relate to others and connect our lives together. Indeed, through the years and hours of meals and television watching, the Keskal family and Kemal connected themselves with a thousand unbreakable threads of complicity and shame, each day further entrapping them in the exact same space in time. While I was reading this book, time did seem to slow dramatically, such that periods of time in the novel became grossly distorted and the hours I spent reading seemed to exist in a time-frozen world.. Like the china dogs Pamuk describes squatting atop every television in every living room around the world, there are universal tropes we employ to distract us from the reality we’re all unwillingly immersed in. We choose what to focus on, what to stare at, what to obsess over, often simply as a way to avoid the perils of focusing on what is most present, pressing, and dangerous. With bombs and shootings ricocheting through the streets, the characters in this novel ate mundane meals placidly, choosing to ignore not only civil war raging just outside their apartment, but the ridiculously socially inappropriate behavior in which they were all complicit. They gazed at the china dog, rolled their domestic cigarettes, and commented blandly on Fusun’s bland paintings.. In just such a way the reader is asked to ignore the rising insanity and dark obsession of the central plot, and focus instead on the banal details of Fusun’s hair clips and Kemal’s sighs. We are complicit in touring a museum of unbelievably petty objects because we cannot bear the sight of Kemal’s lunatic pathos or Fusun’s circling rage. We comment on a butterfly earring because we have accepted our docent’s explanation of its importance, and because we cannot comment on the things we cannot see or understand.. But at times, wandering through the displays, we catch a glimpse of the war outside, the mounting social and military furies that circle the story, and we see, for a moment, the precarious ludicrousness of Kemal’s position, and our own. For the most part, however, we choose not to glance at our watches, and instead decide to live within the warm stagnant time that a museum of innocence—and ignorance—offers.","Mar 30, 2010"
2644615,Vel,"Leave it to Orhan Pamuk to weave an intricate post-modern tale about Istanbul. No surprises here. What is intriguing about this book, however, is not so much the story itself, but rather the multiple levels of ontological questions it raises. (Preposterous, I know, bear with me.). In a nutshell and without too many spoilers, the rich Turkish prick Kemal has a brief 44-day affair with a poor girl, Füsun, in Istanbul, falling madly in love with her. Initially carrying on with his socially acceptable engagement, he eventually breaks it only to realise she has married someone else. The next eight years he spends much of his time with her relatives as a friend of the family, waiting, hoping, praying, preying for her marriage to break. Oh, and did I forget to mention he just so happens to hoard anything and everything that has come into contact with her - from her earrings down to the thousands of cigarette butts. When the whole thing is over-over, he exhibits all these hoarded objects in his ""Museum of Innocence"".. If it sounds cringeworthy and self-indulgent, yes it is; brace yourself for well over 600 pages of ""The Sorrows of Young Kemal bei"". Pamuk however is a masterful writer and the book is never boring, and fills much of its bulk with social observations on Turkish everyday life you wouldn't otherwise be likely to come across (perhaps most interestingly, on virginity and sexuality in light of Turkey's europeanisation). Where the book excels, and the reason it is worth your time, though, are its subtle ruminations on time and memory. Kemal passionately collects anything of Füsun's, with the sole purpose of remembering (perhaps reliving) his time with her in the apartment they used to make love -- is he truly travelling through time via his fetishised possessions, or is he merely living vicariously in a pitiful present moment, communicating with inanimate objects instead of spending time with living beings? Does time pass in an equal manner for everyone, or is it something which can be rendered completely subjective? Does he, in essence, negate time by placing all the objects representing every moment he has spent with his beloved in the same room? It would appear that Pamuk has a very Bergsonian/Proustian view of time, and his observations on the matter are a pleasure to read.. What I find absolutely mindblowing, and what earns Pamuk my utmost respect for him as a writer and as a human being (as if he needs it), is that he has invested (squandered, really) his Nobel prize money to build an actual ""Museum of Innocence"" in Istanbul with actual exhibits that complement this fictional story. The ontological questions this act raises are obvious and endlessly profound. Furthermore, it is a challenge towards the notion that only 'historically' important objects are worthy of being exhibited. In his view, anything can be perpetualised in a museum. A conviction Nick Cave obviously shares with his fascinating online ""Museum of Important Shit"".. And if you feel like adding another layer to this metaphysical puzzle, please see the wonderful eponymous art documentary by Grant Gee. That's right, the film of the museum of the book of the story which is entirely made up.. And also, allegedly, if you bring a copy of the book to the museum, you may enter for free. Good to know.","Oct 08, 2016"
1753018,Paula Koneazny,"Although I have been a big fan of Pamuk's since I acquired The New Life in an English Department holiday book exchange back in 1997, I slogged through his latest novel. It is long (over 500 pages) and it feels excruciatingly, even tediously, long. However, even though I didn't much enjoy reading this novel, I know I will think about it more than a lot of books I've read. The Museum of Innocence is the very detailed account of a man named Kemal's (wealthy scion of the Istanbul haute-bourgeoisie) obsessive love for his much younger, distant cousin Fusun. That's the overt story. The novel brings to my mind, for very different reasons Nabokov's Lolita, Carsen Mcculler's Ballad of the Sad Cafe and the novels of Milan Kundera. Back when I read Nabokov's Lolita, I wasn't able to overcome my disgust and anger over HH's rape of Lolita the child, no matter how cognizant I was of the universally-proclaimed literary merit of the work and the fact that the novel is really about language and many things other than its ostensible story. In a similar, although less extreme, fashion, Pamuk's novel is about many things other than its ""story"" of one man's oppressive devotion to his love object. These other subjects include tradition & modernity with their uneasy commingling in contemporary Turkey; time, timelessness & nostalgia; historical event versus the fluidity of experience (emotional, psychological, sensual); & time as space (home, country, world, museum) & vice versa. Pamuk writes ""Real museums are places where Time is transformed into Space."" As in many of Pamuk's novels, current political, economic & social events run in the background & occasionally burst into the foreground of the ""love"" story: a news reel between programs on the TV, the curfews that interrupt Kemal's evenings with Fusun & her parents, the military coup that causes Kemal and his chauffeur to be stopped and questioned regarding a quince grater (potential weapon?) that Kemal has pilfered from Fusun's home to add to his collection of objects related to & touched by his beloved. More than anything, Pamuk, as in his memoir Istanbul, writes about a place and that place is Turkey and, even more specifically, Istanbul & its environs (the Bosphorus is central). The loved one is both the city and the woman; Kemal's obsession and anguish is that of a man who cherishes the old yalis, the popular neighborhoods and the trashy censored films churned out by the Turkish film industry while he remains tied to the the upper middle-class, Western-educated social & economic elite with their posh parties at the Hilton Hotel and all-night outings to fashionable bars, nightclubs & restaurants. Everyone (at least all the men) of every social class drinks glass after glass of the national liquor, raki, even though the rich switch to black market whiskey and champagne for their tony affairs. As several other reviewers have mentioned, the novel is most readable in its final 100 pages, when events speed up and reach their mostly inevitable conclusion. Star rating: somewhere between ""OK"" and ""I liked it.""","Oct 30, 2010"
426277,James,"Writing about Vladimir Nabokov's novel Ada, Orhan Pamuk said that ""Nabokov reminds us that our memories allow us to carry our childhood with us, and with it the golden age we thought we had left behind."" This is not that dissimilar from the memories of the narrator of Orhan Pamuk's scintillating novel The Museum of Innocence. It is with a memory of love, obsessive and passionate, inflamed by Eros that Kemal, the narrator of the story, begins his tale.. It is a tale that reminded me of Socrates discussion of the myth of the chariot in The Phaedrus. The charioteer is filled with warmth and desire as he gazes into the eyes of the one he loves. Ultimately he is torn by a sort of divine madness. In the novel Kemal tells how ""I first began to feel fissures opening in my soul, wounds of the sort that plunge men into a deep dark, lifelong loneliness for which there is no cure."" (pp 52-3). Fairly soon into the story Kemal throws over the perfection of his fiance, Sibel, whose ""perfect placement of every pearl"" cannot compete with the hold that Eros has over him in his overwhelming passion of the young girl Fusun.. Now if this is all there was to this story the novel would be short, semi-sweet, and in spite of the beautiful prose of the author not worthy of much further comment. But, as you may suspect there is more to this novel than this simple, albeit passionate, tale of a Turkish love triangle. No, the Museum of Innocence plumbs the depths of illusion. There is the illusion of love, the illusion of time, and ultimately the illusion of life.. The malleability of time is evidence of what the narrator calls ""the illusion that is time."" (p 282) It is compared to the difference between the personal life we each live within and the ""official"" time that we share with others. Kemal's obsessive love controlled his personal time even as the clock on the wall in Fusun's home ticked off the ""time"". The reader experiences a similar sensation when the regularity of short chapters of the novel is suddenly broken by chapter 24, ""The Engagement Party"", which is almost five times longer than the average length of those preceding. You must discover for yourself what intimacies of plot detail warrant a slowing of the flow of the story. Kemal's obsessive love is also illusory and leads him through memories of a life that is just as much illusion as he is blinded to the reality of the individuals who people his world.. Ultimately the narrative succeeds in communicating the complexity of what Kemal calls ""the strange and mysterious spirit"" of his days spent pursuing the illusion of life through obsessive love. The suspense keeps building as the novel progresses to the point where you begin to feel like those actors on the stage who wait for the next direction. The novel becomes a collection of episodes in the life of a collector - someone whose passions make for exceptional reading.","Nov 04, 2009"
1652278,Susan,"The intrusion of the real-life author into a novel is a mark of post-modernism designed force the reader to step back and look at the novel as a fiction (something created by humans rather than inherent in the natural world) and one way writers have been doing that for 50 years has been to intrude themselves into the novel.(Of course this intrusion of the writer was also rebellion against H James' insistence that the fabric of the fiction be inviolable, allowing none of the ""dear reader"" stuff of preceding fictions.) Sort of like Hitchcock makes tidbit appearances in his films, a face in the crowd, a man on the bus, etc. It reminds us that this world we're been participating in is not real, that the story and its focus is ""made up"" by one person. (I always saw Hitchcock as egotistical in his obsession to appear in his film, but all creators have big egos--otherwise how could they sustain their work which is done absolutely alone with bare-minimum tools and depends entirely on their own ability to ""make up stuff""?). In this novel it's like Pamuk, in using himself as character (you must think of the Pamuk in the novel as a character as well of course) creates sort of an after-the-fact frame for his tale. And indeed, the minute we recognize Pamuk is telling the tale, its significance broadens and we see clearly that this is not just a tale of one man's obsession with a woman but a sociological study of a man who's love puts him on the outside to observe the society he is (or was) a part of. A society changing as it grows in wealth and experience of the outside world. As Fusun is the focus of Kemal's museum, so Kemal is the focus of Pamuk's.. Of course, when we run into the Pamuk family early in the story and when Orhan attends the engagement party we must be expecting something like this. That was a little more blatant than Hitchcock waiting for a bus in whatever film that was.. I thought it was a bit arbitrary to kill off Kemal, but it makes it much easier to turn his story into an archeological/sociological one.. I'm curious too how this story became a meditation on museums, what they're for and how they come about. We go from an admittedly nutty man who saves the salt shakers from the table where he eats with his beloved to challenging the notion of what a museum is, what it means to society and how it's used. (There I see some commonality with Byatt's The Children's Book where there's a minor but significant focus on the V&A and how it developed, what role it was intended to fill, etc.)","Dec 16, 2009"

2142739,Malak Alrashed,"2017 is at its beginning but all the same, I'd still vote for this book as The Worst Book of the Year. Reasons why? Well. Here you go:. 1- I don't know Pamuk quite as much as I should, but in this novel, he romanticises cheating (all kind of cheating you name it: girlfriend\lover cheating, fiance\lover cheating, married couple cheating..etc). The main character; Kemal cannot possibly find love unless it's forbidden. He likes the drama of it. He's engaged to a woman that's yes socially suitable for him BUT HE FREAKING CHOSE HER. YET he's all like:. How about we cheat on her with a younger girl? YES YES. That's our man. Wait... what? I should be a man and end things with my fiance since I realised that I'm not good for her? What are you talking about? NO. Life is not that simple. I'm the victim here. Please fell sorry for me, PLEASE.. I tried to sympathise with the story of Kemal and Füsun (his lover). But I couldn't and I don't know why; maybe because the book doesn't acknowledge Kemal's sins. Quite the opposite Pamuk makes cheating sounds amazing. In fact, there's a part where Kemal and his father have an intimate moment and get to talk about love. Guess what was his father's great love story? He cheated on his mum and it was the best thing in his life. Men in this book are trash.. 2- The writing itself is not bad. It's actually good; I mean in terms of construction, time control and the descriptions of Istanbul is all something I admired. But whenever the writing is good, the shallowness of the characters and the story interpret it all.. 3- I don't know if it's only me, but sometimes while I was reading the book, I felt somehow that I was watching a cheesy soap opera. Especially when Pamuk describes Kemal's rich life and his parties. Very cheesy stuff, man.. 4- Pamuk tried to write about the females' identity loss especially between the clash of cultures in Turkey. Now that's interesting! But how would a. Male Novelist. write about females' struggles? The answer is always within himself. Kemal takes girls' virginities and then talks about it. How original.. 5- If I read one more person daring to even compare Lolita to this book, I will double these Five Reasons ten times more.","Feb 27, 2017"
4213936,Hillary Woody,"If you’re the kind of person who gets bored at actual museums, you’ll get bored reading The Museum of Innocence.. The Museum of Innocence was written by Nobel Prize winning author Orhan Pamuk. The story is narrated from the point of view of the museum’s curator, Kemal, who basically spends well over 500 pages pining after a much younger lover. The museum, naturally, is where he displays artifacts relating to their relationship, many of which he has pilfered from her over their time together. The novel is meant, as is discussed in the self-reflexive ending, to serve as a sort of textual docent for the museum.. The entire book is filled with ornate prose, covering a weak plot like a rug. While the writing is fantastic and the plot and premise have interest, the book moves far too slowly even considering it is literary fiction not some paperback romance novel. The length of the novel, though, can likely be credited to the notion the narrator proclaims on page 469, “After all, a love story that ends happily scarcely deserves more than a few sentences.” But then how many sentences does an unhappy love story really need? More than a few, but over 500 pages worth? This book will not convince the reader of that.. What the book does do well is describe a particular place and time. The novel is set in Istanbul primarily in the 1970’s and 1980’s. The particular details that Pamuk calls attention to, provide an extremely rich and captivating setting. The other thing the novel will do is make readers think about happiness, desire, and the things we cling to (both literal and figurative).. Had this novel been about half the length, it could have packed twice the punch. Some stories may need so many pages to be told, but this is not one of them. And certainly while Kemal’s pain is better felt if the reader is dragged through it with him, there is a limit to this method’s effectiveness, which this novel greatly surpassed. Most importantly, there’s something inherently pompous about a novel over 500 pages. It’s rarely justified, and The Museum of Innocence is no exception to this rule.","Oct 11, 2010"
2382451,Rhea,"I began this review long before I finished the book. Halfway through I realized what a momentous feat it would be to finish it.. At the end now, I feel quite a sense of of accomplishment.. The book reads less like a movie and more like a TV series. That is to say,. missing a few chapters wouldn't throw you off the plot at all.. (Mostly since nothing concrete happens.). To truely experience Kemal's 8 years of unrequited love one has to take the long and arduous journey with him (through 500 odd pages).. What you get is a collection of symbols and motifs woven together into a story. There are some pieces that are beautiful: assigning each cigarette she has smoked with a part of her personality, the chapter 'sometimes' which itself reads like a museum of moments.. All culminating to the idea that ordinary moments and ordinary objects (china dogs and hair clips) can have special meaning simply because of the memories attached to them.. (Much like the Little Prince's rose, special only because it was his.). Having read all the other reviews, I expected to feel pity, even disgust for Kemal and his obsessive, compulsive, kleptomaniac love.. What I didn't expect to feel was an utter and complete dislike for the love interest, Fusun.. To me she was an immature, self-centered character, unworthy of such love. Even her eventual unfortunate ending was brought about by herself. After 'punishing' the man she loved for 8 years, and leaving her husband only after his open cheating, even the short-lived Kemal-Fusun love story at the end didn't seem so loving after all.. The most beautiful character in the story was Istanbul itself,. emerging from the backdrop to the living, breathing multidimensional. From lavish cafes, to street side stalls, parties at the Hilton, open air cinemas the history and culture of the city seep through.. Orhan Pamuk's insertion of himself into the story, while seemingly experimental, was unnecessary and somewhat tedious at the end of 500 pages. But you can't blame the editor/ publisher: one doesn't give too strong a critique to a Nobel Prize winner.","Jul 27, 2012"
10177080,lavinia,"oh.... my.... goooood!. This book was like a never ending story! It was as if I'd read and read and read and get nowhere! A few years ago, when I read My Name is Red, I was fascinated by Pamuk's ability to tell a story and combine tradition and civilization into one single book. The Museum of Innocence touches old Istanbul or the 70s, we find out lots of interesting aspects of the city, but the story, after the first half of the book, is completely inexistent!. If it would have ended at page 250, insted of 630 (my edition), it would have been a great book! Sure, the guy was selfish to think that he could have both women, sure they both left him in the end (actually in the middle, but that's what I consider to be the end of the book really), and that's that, it should have ended there! But noooo, Pamuk had to give it a try to challenge Proust himself (I'm surprised he didn't reach 1000 pages of obsessions in the end...) and write about another eight whole years when nothing happened except for the storytellers inability to win back his love, and literally stalk her, obsess with her, and do nothing else!. The only part that's interesting from beginning to end is the description of Istanbul during those years. A while ago, when I visited the city, I was too young and ignorant to notice most of these things (some of them are as valid today as they were in the 70s). But the book is alive, it gives you a really good feeling of this city that's so different from the ones that we grew up in.. That being said, it was a struggle to finish this book, but I was curious until the end to see if there's a twist of some sort - it wasn't. It didn't change my opinion of Orhan Pamuk's writing, I'm sure many people find this book extremely interesting. If you've read Proust's In Search of Lost Time, you won't have any trouble coping with this one. As for me, I've only read the first 3 volumes of that, and I'm saving the rest for when I'll be retired, in my 60s. Life's just too short to be reading books of infinite length in which nothing happens!","Nov 23, 2012"
18371391,Kyc,"The Museum of Innocence. is so long (728 pages), so hypnotically told, yet so enthrallingly. empty. , that I would unhesitatingly call it literary pulp like most of Haruki Murakami’s works.. Here's a work of a master storyteller and Nobel Laureaten spun with little substance. It is bewitchingly told. Yet in the end, it's just superficial fluff.. Anyone who tries to persuade you that it stands alongside. Lolita. , let alone. Madame Bovary. or. Anna Karenina. , is wildly misled by promotional puffs. The novel resembles an artfully put together, overlong arthouse marathon movie trying hard to convince an audience of its greatness.. The narrative is about a young Turkish heir Kemal engaged to a socialite who gets obsessed with his distant cousin, 18-year-old shopgirl Füsun. They meet to make love in long sessions. Füsun eventually disappears; Kemal obsesses over her. Then he meets her again, now married.. Much of the first half of the book is repetitive, with Kemal’s obsession over Füsun and lovemaking sessions repeated. ad nauseam. . The plot doesn’t develop, the characters don’t develop, the chapters have silly titles which instantly give the plot away, or don’t mean anything.. The Most Important Thing in Life is to be Happy. The Streets that Reminded Me of Her. Happiness Means Being Close to the One You Love, That’s All.. When the slow-moving story does get going, midway in the book, the new subject—the Turkish film industry— appears so disjointed from what has happened, it appears Pamuk is patching up a botched job. And the silly chapter titles—and the occasional pretentious prose—persist. The story ends tragically, though the reason why appears to be because Pamuk has to end the narrative pompously.. I give one extra star to Orphan Pamuk, who can be such an observant, evocative writer. It was his descriptions of 70s-80s Istanbul which kept me reading until the end. What a pity this whole exercise doesn’t amount to much, merely to convince readers they are overwhelmed by profound highbrow literature with a capital L.","May 07, 2018"
49332575,Juan Ca,"Kemal cherishes every physical relic of Füsun that he can save or steal: a barrette, a salt shaker she once touched, the little china dog that sits on top of her family's television. Those objects eventually find their home in the museum of the novel's title, a shrine to everyday life that he will spend his last years in building. Both his collecting and The Museum of Innocence itself are best understood as examples of what Pamuk elsewhere calls hüzün. It is the Turkish word for melancholy, but hüzün has a more complicated weight than the English term. It carries a theological understanding of the ""place of loss and grief"", it sustains notes of elegy and nostalgia, it conveys a sense of ""worldly failure [and] listlessness"", and it stands above all as the defining emotion of this post-imperial capital.. So to both author and character, Istanbul's every place and moment of beauty seem as if irradiated by sadness. That makes the novel a modern-day counterpart to the masterpiece Pamuk set in the 16th-century city. It does have weaknesses. Most of Kemal's friends are names rather than fully realised characters, and however vivid his desire for Füsun, she herself remains a bit shadowy. The novel, too, could have been shorter. Yet the story isn't so loosely built as it seems, and it's hard to say just which meal or moment of longing should go. The Museum of Innocence earns its length, a length that allows Kemal's story to burrow into us, a habit one looks forward to indulging.. In its last pages a minor character named Orhan Pamuk reappears, a figure last seen as an awkward young man at a party. The metafictional moment makes one pause; this has been so entirely satisfying as a realist narrative. But the step into a different kind of writing is so sure-footed that it only reinforces the power of Pamuk's central conceit, Kemal's fond foolish dream of a museum built to honour his love for Füsun, his lost paradise of their days together.","Jan 02, 2016"
5266913,Abhijit Srivastava,"This book may, well, become one of your reasons to visit Istanbul.. This is primarily a love story, and a very beautiful one at that. The narration is quite relaxed, but the high sentimental quotient engraved in the writing will engross you till the very end, and like many of Pamuk's stories, here also, Pamuk emerges as a character in the story.. The Museum of Innocence. is a soulful tale of love found and lost and found again and... well, you know the rhetoric! The strong point of the story is the perplexing first person narration and the use of everyday objects that has been used to present the author with the images of the lives lived by the lead protagonists of this story.. The actual museum which Orhan Pamuk has built in Istanbul actually contains all the objects that have been mentioned in the story. The book runs high on emotions and the East-West divide the protagonists face while living in a city that is, in reality, divided between two continents. Here, the predicament of the characters make them see love, hate and everything in-between as a bifurcated sheet, sometimes separated, sometimes overlapping.. While, the experiences of the lead character. Kemal. is profoundly elaborated, sometimes, you feel like it's too much! This is, perhaps, a slight dent in this otherwise beautiful work. If you have read. My Name is Red. (which is a brilliant literary work)you would understand the difference that has seeped into Pamuk's writings over the past few years.. But overall, this book has got it's own brownie points in the fine art of realism-based story telling. I mean, there's a museum built in the remembrance of the fictitious characters of this book.. Go for it, and have a good time. And then, make plans for a visit to Istanbul in the near future.","May 30, 2012"
23058730,Kshitij Joshi,"Let everyone know, I lived a very happy life. This novel by Mr Pamuk demands an extraordinary, nay an other-worldly patience and a heart from the reader, for the protagonist laboriously expands on the grief of him having lost Fusun to another man, over a massively long series of chapters that never seem to end. Many here on Goodreads in their reviews have bemoaned the extent to which Kemal goes on to express his suffering, not unknown to, but un-felt by the men and women in his world, but fail to understand its necessity. It challenges even the most empathetic of the readers, to keep on at his side during this madness of his obsession and, open and shameless yearning for Fusun, leading to his public disgrace. For an impatient world ever ready to move on to newer and brighter prospects, and unable to tolerate a troubled man after a while, sympathizing with him at first and getting disgusted with him later on, you cannot even blame many readers who start harboring extreme loathing for the lead character and the novel as they pass through these chapters. It is only when we are deprived of what we crave for the most for an extended period, do we begin to appreciate its worth. Herein lies Pamuk's genius and it is with this trick which he employs so masterfully (that many readers fail to notice and get entrapped by), that makes this story beautiful. If I may be pardoned for providing an over-simplification, the author prepares a dig long enough with the shovel of chapters of Kemal's defeat, so as to fill it with ephemeral happiness, to bring this story to a brilliant and unexpected conclusion, a similar method that he employs very tactfully for another great novel of his i.e.. Snow. .","Aug 14, 2018"
8401122,Nermy,"This is my second novel to read for Orhan, though I didn't find it as much magnificent as "" my name is red "" I liked it. The author highlighted the major conflict between modernity and tradition in this novel he tackles the social and personal demeanor regarding love and sex. I think it ain't easy for non eastern societies to define and understand this issue in the novel, it is a fact where in eastern societies though people and especially men may think themselves thinking in a modern way and what they actually do at the end of the day is what built inside in "" eastern culture "" that makes them appears as contradictory personalities. Besides giving others more than enough space and letting others' views penetrate their personal lives in a way that makes them act like what others think and not what they actually think.. The turn over at the end of the novel surprised me that made me feel confused cant figure out Kemal true feelings I thought it was sexual obsession not love though I still blame him for his deeds at the beginning which he shortly regret. He was selfish and indecisive, hence he suffers years for realizing how much he loved Fusun. However, I pitied him at the end I found him innocent in his love. Yup, sometimes we define our feelings when it is too late.. The end of the novel disappointed me, touched me that made me think a lot about the whole story again trying to know whom to blame ppl or us or culture.. But, what I disliked in the novel is the repetition of his obsession and suffering that made me feel bore. Also, I wanted to know more about Fusun status and feelings during and before separation and the beginning of his suffering to understand and judge well.. Liked the book.","Apr 26, 2012"

Kemal our narrator is a man from a wealthy family, he has everything going for him, he is engaged to the French educated Sibel from another wealthy family, he thinks of himself as modern and has what seems to be an unimportant affair with Füsun, a shop-girl and poor relative. Then Füsun disappears and Sibel breaks off the engagement. Kemal is plunged into a deep melancholy (the Turkish idea of. Huzun. ) feeling a great loss for Füsun. Füsun reappears almost a year later, with a husband, a young but poor film screenwriter. Kemal humiliates and tortures himself by repeatedly visiting the newly weds and Füsun's parents in their poor neighbourhood. Füsun's husband thinks the visits are so that Kemal will finance a film he wants to make with Füsun as the star.. Pico Iyer in the New York Review of Books, describes the novel as a ""spacious love story a little like a Nabokovian version of Love in the Time of Cholera."" This is a tale of a man's obsession for an impossible love, like I imagine Lolita, a book I have so far managed to avoid despite all the plaudits. I have read Love in the Time of Cholera and found the love obsession there a little implausible.. The museum of the title is a collection of artifacts like 4,213 cigarette butts which had touched Füsun's lips, catalogued and dated by the obsessive kleptomaniac narrator.

10661959,Ali Nazifpour,"Certainly one of the whist novels I have ever read. The book is over sentimental, lame, and painful. It could easily lose two thirds of its size, it could easily be a novella. The book keeps adding unnecessary characters and scenes, there are long irrelevant things just attached that serve no purpose, and there are pages and pages of the protagonist whining and whining and whining.. The book is disgustingly misogynistic. Some of it can be justified of course by realism, although it dialysis make reading it any easier, but ultimately a lot of it is unintentional and clearly the warped idea of Pamuk of love as a sexist rapey man. Just the fact that he thinks behaving like a stalker is romantic and Kemal's stalker's den is actually a museum of ""innocence"" would be enough for me to get a restriction order.. The characters have less personality than a cardboard box and I wonder how the author can waste 700 pages without accidentally adding a dimension to his characters. Fusun is the beloved who has no characteristic but being loved by this sick demented man.. And overall there's more subtelty and nuance in a Bollywood movie when it comes to love and oh my god less pathos and sensationalistic vomits. If any of these intellectual types pretend to hate Bollywood while love this novel be sure that their behavior is a charade.. In the back of the book there is some dangerous person writing for Financial Times who says this is a great love story like Lolita. Dude if you think Lolita is a love story you need to castrate yourself. Also this novel sucks and its only similarity with Lolita is that its protagonist is a dangerous pervert.

1425243,Cheryl,"The book, a rather long one, seemed to just go on and on. I suppose that Pamuk is demonstrating the obsessiveness of the main character, Kamal, but it became very tedious to me and I kept waiting for the story to go somewhere.. In Museum of Innocence, Pamuk deals with how society (characterized by Kamal) can objectify women, making them things to possess and not looking at them as subjects with wants,needs, aspirations, etc.. In his Nobel Prize lecture, Pamuk said:. What literature needs most to tell and investigate today are humanity's basic fears: the fear of being left outside, and the fear of counting for nothing, and the feelings of worthlessness that come with such fears; the collective humiliations, vulnerabilities, slights, grievances, sensitivities, and imagined insults, and the nationalist boasts and inflations that are their next of kin ... Whenever I am confronted by such sentiments, and by the irrational, overstated language in which they are usually expressed, I know they touch on a darkness inside me. We have often witnessed peoples, societies and nations outside the Western world–and I can identify with them easily–succumbing to fears that sometimes lead them to commit stupidities, all because of their fears of humiliation and their sensitivities. I also know that in the West–a world with which I can identify with the same ease–nations and peoples taking an excessive pride in their wealth, and in their having brought us the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and Modernism, have, from time to time, succumbed to a self-satisfaction that is almost as stupid.","Mar 24, 2010"
10946717,Jim Hecimovich,"I have read and taught both Lolita and Love in the Time of Cholera. The comparison of The Museum of Innocence to those novels is apt. But The Museum of Innocence is nowhere near as good as either of them.. Pamuk's novel is, at times, monotonous and tedious. I read it quickly because Pamuk is such a good writer that, despite its flaws, the book held me. A bit of humor (as in Love in the Time of Cholera) would have lightened the load considerably. The pervasive melancholy and self-pity can be a bit much at times.. The lack of engagement with the ""real"" world in Turkey (the violent political turmoil in the background of the novel, never engaged in any historical way) is telling. Kemal does not engage in his wider world. Instead, he is limited to his social circle and Fusun's family. He does not more deeply consider his failure to escape the ""old"" Turkey and live in the new one, other than to enjoy the materialistic aspects of Westernization that come to Turkey during his life. Even as he ages, we get no sense that he knows what is going on in the world or why. The result is a character for whom one may have compassion (have you ever been obsessed with a person even for a short time, much less a lifetime?; if so, you'll feel compassion) but not understanding. Pamuk's various attempts to explain Kemal's life in terms of Aristotelian concepts of the relation between time and space simply does little to expand the examination of Kemal's life into a greater universal understanding. The musings on museums are interesting (the relation of objects, memory, time, and space) but nowhere near enough to make this a satisfying novel.","Jul 19, 2013"
5752751,Ana-Maria Bujor,"I've read some pretty bad love stories this year, so when I got this book I was a bit skeptical, especially after having read the blurb on the back. But this book was surprisingly good in spite of the premise (he loves her, she loves him, but they can't be together) as this boring trope was transformed into a very neat concept. So, briefly, this is the story of a privileged young man who falls in love with a gorgeous but poor girl, but due to circumstances, they cannot be together. He spends the next 8 years observing her from a distance and collecting all sorts of items she touched, from cigarettes to porcelain dogs.. It may sound like a boring premise for almost 800 pages, but I found the opposite to be true. The characters are quite flawed, but very human. So when the main character loses a very important contract and almost bankrupts his company due to jealousy over a possible rival, it fits the story perfectly. The main character is not a very likeable person, but his evolution and vulnerability, as well as his developing obsession are very interesting to observe.. The analysis of the society of the time is also very interesting, especially in areas related to relationships between men and women. Thus, one gets to feel for the main female character, who always has to depend on someone and has all her hopes and dreams controlled by the men around her, for whom she is just an object of desire.. The museum concept, which comes to life at the end, is very neat, so now I'm sorry I did not get to see the actual museum during my stay in Istanbul this year. I guess it's next time.","Nov 19, 2016"
91934471,MoniqueWritesOnSundays,"Plot. If Museum of Innocence taught me anything it is the value of patience. This is a novel by the Nobel prize (2006) winning author Orhan Pamuk. This story follows the lives of wealthy Kemal and his poor, younger distant relation Fusun Keskin with which Kemal has an affair while engaged to marry Sibel, who is perfectly suited to him also being from Istanbul high society. Kemal plans to do what most men have done in Turkey and marry the socially acceptable woman while maintaining his affair with the woman he actually desires. This is the introduction to the complicated dynamic between sex and religion in the context of the transitional state of western-meets-eastern culture experienced in Turkey in the seventies. Sex soon turns to obsession however, when Fusun leaves Kemal after believing that, while she gave him her virginity, he had no intention of ever marrying her. Kemal then becomes besotted with his lost love and begins a decades long journey of dedication toward regaining the passionate love he had once shared with Fusun.. Themes. While the novel hauntingly depicts how the act of obsession itself requires stealth-like patience akin to that of the hunt, it is the patience required as a reader that I take with me foremost after reading the intricate details of Kemal and Fusun’s love. Although I agree with reviews that the narrative becomes difficult to engage with during the thick of Kemal and Fusun’s affair, I must confess that I am guilty of eventually sharing in Kemal’s obsession. When I resigned myself to the book I was able to put my judgements aside about how one should act in the face of love and rejection and then I too fell prey to the romanticism of this tale. My persistence was further rewarded as the story continued to unfold. What is it about this enigmatic beauty, Fusun, that renders men powerless? And why is it that Kemal in particular is such victim to Fusun’s charms? The answer must be reciprocity. Unlike her other admirers, Fusun loved Kemal back and so a powerful story of sex, love and identity unfurls.. Pamuk’s descriptions of every minute detail of Kemal’s interactions with Fusun can become laboured to read. Kemal fixates on her honey coloured skin, the nape of her neck, the dampness of her discarded cigarette butt, the sounds of the ships on the Bosphorus that marked their many encounters, however when I considered that my irritation with these infatuations might reflect my own opinions about obsession, I was able to cast judgement aside and immerse myself in these descriptions that seduced me with their subtlety and seeming insignificance, which alone are quite ordinary but when put together form a complex view of the constituents of unrequited love.. Many call Kemal obsessed but he displays restraint in his pursuit of Fusun when she eventually moves on with another man, as he expertly implicates himself in her new relationship and her family without actually disrespecting the boundaries of their culture or the institution of marriage. The fact that he was unable to do this for his former fiancé Sibel in having the affair with Fusun in the first place, is indicative of his love for Fusun, not merely obsession.. The literary process; Ekphrasis; the process of using detailed description of visual art as a literary device.. It is Pamuk’s use of innocuous, protracted descriptions about the mundane that left me feeling intimately acquainted with the characters. As a reader it can’t be argued that you are left knowing Fusun intimately in a way that few other characterisations allow. In the novel, and it’s accompanying museum, isn’t that Pamuk’s point; to display the power that ordinary objects have to encapsulate and showcase sentiment we attach to them from our experiences? By building a museum of objects to paint a picture of life, ordinary objects become art. From Kemal’s hoarding collections I was able to imagine the thickness of Fusun’s hair, her expressions when she smoked, how her body moved when she made love, her voice and much more. I witnessed her evolution from teen to young woman in a society that nervously celebrated the beauty she was at a loss to hide and that she resented having to.. Pamuk demonstrates the power of ekphrasis to bring fiction to life. This aligns with Kemal’s goal also; to celebrate the object of his love and desire through the elemental objects that form their story.. Pamuk succeeds in showing how juxtaposition of objects (particularly as he describes it in the actual museum) can freeze time, which again is also Kemal’s ultimate focus, to preserve the moments that illustrate the love of his life. Pamuk’s focus on small details leaves the reader unaware that while they have been lead to fixate on an array of diminutive features like china dogs that adorned the Keskin household, hair pins and signate earrings, almost 10 years have been ticking away in the background.. Who should read it?. This novel will please those who enjoy a layered narrative with complex characters that implore you to see them for more than their actions. Pamuk writes with the steely nerve and and meticulousness of a surgeon. His protracted attention to detail is both impressive and imperative (and I’d argue, intentional) for depicting how the reverential treatment of the small things showcases the universal beauty of life and living, something accessible to us all despite class or culture.. This not a simple read. The writing and story are undeniably beautiful, but this is a book that makes you work to see it’s full worth. There was a point where I had to encourage myself to read on, thankfully my persistence was rewarded for had I not patiently allowed Kemal free reign from the start to tell me about Fusun as he saw her, I would not have fully appreciated the latter half of the story and understood why a man would relinquish so much for love.. Those who liked The Kite Runner Khaled Hoseinni, and, Follow Your Heart Susanna Tamaro should read this book.. Final word. I loved this novel. It left me thinking about my own life and loves, past and present, and had me assessing my commitment to love at various stages through out my life. I was also left thankful for living in a country where women have greater liberties relative to places like Turkey. It also made me want to travel to the many museums referred to in the novel, particularly the Baggetti Valsecchi Museum in Milan.. As all good novels should after I finished it, The Museum of Innocence left me asking “what am I going to do now?” and I immediately began googling for evidence that it is based on fact, such was the liveliness of the story and the dynamic between characters, particularly at the very end.. Left a better person rating: 5/5. Attribute I take away: the value of patience.","Jan 17, 2019"
58921426,Keenan,"The Nauseum of Repetitive Self Indulgence. This is one of those books where I'll instantly lose respect for someone if they say they enjoy it.. Hundreds of pages of low grade romantic drivel sprinkled with small vignettes of characters whose every thought seems to revolve around men and women and brothels and love and romance and virginity and purity. At least in other acclaimed books where men have affairs (. The End of the Affair. and. The Lover. come to mind), the characters are defined by more than their erotic feelings, be it internal religious turmoil or personal tragedy or what have you. You can't go a few words without hearing about Fusun's lips or slender waist. Oh I just want to kiss you so so bad, muah muah muah. GARBAGE.. Another beef I have with this book is how every man seems to be having affairs and yet everyone also wears their emotions on their sleeve. The moment Kemal drifts away thinking of his teenage love someone will ask if he's doing alright. And yet he can escape for hours each day without arousing suspicion.. ALSO, you don't need to repeat 8000 times about Turkish relations between men and women: if she's a virgin, you want to marry her. If she's not but she's hot, it's okay to have her on the side. A more adept author would be able to express this mentality through actions and setting, rather than laying it on thicker than honey baklava.. I'm also embarrassed that I lent this garbage to my boss's daughter while we were all on vacation (since she ran out of presumably GOOD books), so now I'm probably some sort of weird Turkish pervert in her eyes. SAD.","Aug 17, 2019"
2222340,Chris,"""It was the happiest moment of my life, though I didn't know it."" So begins 532 pages of love, obsession, depression, joy, and tragedy. That opening sentence had me hooked and so I began what turned out to be an at times enthralling,sometimes disturbing, and other times tedious journey into a man's tortured soul. This story is being told in retrospect by Kemal, a rich upperclass Turk and you immediately know it's headed for a train wreck of monumental proportions. Like lookie-lou's at a traffic accident, the reader's morbid curiousity is stimulated and must unravel what will ultimately happen to him and the love of his life, Fusun. Pamuk or Kemal emphasizes constantly the uniqueness of the situation to the culture of Turkey. But I think this overemphasis has the opposite effect. I could see what's unfolding happen in any culture with a love besotted man. Once Kemal later in the book starts to visit museums around the world and seeks out collectors of all sorts of paraphernalia, he looks less and less like a Turk but any man from any country. Pages up to 250 or so go fast and then it gets tedious and then it takes off again when there is a rapprochement. I was left with a diversity of feelings for Kemal: empathy, boredom,disgust,contempt. Pamuk took me to a lot of places in this book. I can see this book being analyzed in a college literature class. I can also see why the author was awarded the Nobel, but that was before he wrote Chapter 69 of this book in which every sentence begins with the word ""sometimes."" I'll be reading more from Orhan Bey.","Mar 30, 2011"
3572305,Nina,"As I finished this book I was torn by my two reactions to it.First one was negative: way too long for this story (I definitely think the book would have benefited by being ab.300 pages-and, by the way, I do love long books), full of ambitions to be of Proustian caliber (it made me want to reread the real thing),but never quite achieving it and also by the lack of substance in describing Fusun, the love of Kemal's life.It is amazing how often we read her name on the page and, yet, the only glimpse of her we get is mostly of visual, objectifying nature.He loves her,but he never attempts to see past her splendid interior. As he confesses somewhere in the beginning he never tries to understand her (although do we ever really ""understand"" anyone?). He loves his dream and as Fusun says at one point because of Kemal she could not live her life and the reader surely sees it, but Pamuk could have definitely done a better job in flashing out Fusun's character more (in a real, rather then Kemal's way).. My second reaction was more positive:this poignant,futile, melancholic, romantic story tells a tale of love that started with 44 days and lasted (and shaped) a lifetime and is bound to leave you with a bittersweet aftertaste.The obsession that was never meant to end happily (yet,another IMO forced turn) is set in real city and society that portrayed with realism and deep understanding that justifies the time spent on reading the book..

5440651,Mark Smith,"I don't usually review the titles I add to Goodreads. After all, how presumptuous to ""review"" a book by a nobel laureate. But I am so amazed by this book that I couldn't resist. Maybe because I visited the actual Museum of Innocence in Istanbul--twice, as I found it immensely intriguing--but this seems like one of the most ingenious, creative and unusual, and moving books I have ever read. Although parts of the book do become somewhat hard to read, with Kemal's unending obsessiveness over Füsun, and the minutia of his collections, catalogues, and chronologies, overall, it is this incredible detail that gives the book its unique power and gravity. Much in the same way that Joyce commented that if Dublin were to disappear from the Earth it could be recreated from Ulysses, so too could Istanbul be recreated from this novel. It is a love affair with that city just as much as it is between Kemal and Füsun. But most of all, this is a love story, at once sad and joyous, starring lovers who are by turns infuriating, flawed, and endearing, in short, human. In the strange way that this book moves in and out of a physical reality with its real-life companion museum, the reader/museum visitor contemplates the way that the totality of objects with which a person interacts in their life defines both the person and the world in which they have lived. Finally, it should be noted that this book was written after Pamuk won the Nobel Prize. When other writers might rest on their laurels, Pamuk created this complex and multifaceted achievement--stunning by any measure.","Nov 03, 2014"
30021330,Lisa Ann,"I have so much to say about this book and the way I felt while reading it. Firstly, Orhan Bey is such an established, meritorious writer! Truly all-inclusive, nothing is left unsaid, Pamuk elaborated every detail of his love, his pain, his loneliness, his passion, his existence and his all-consuming obsession with Füsun.. While reading the 'Museum of Innocence' I felt like I was transported back to the bustling, characteristic, momentous, colourful backstreet neighbourhoods of Istanbul, the parks, the cinemas, the cafes, the walkways, the smoke filled raki bars, and the exquisite architecture! You'd think I had been to Istanbul wouldn't you?! I haven't, Orhan Bey had taken me there through his precise, exhaustive descriptive skills.. I know I will not stop thinking about Kemal Bey and Füsun for a long time, I don't want to ruin this review with spoilers, so therefore I have refrained from commenting about the actual plot.. I am actually going to Istanbul next week for the first time and I cannot wait to visit the 'Museum of Innocence', and all the wonderful places I 'visited' while reading the novel, such as the Bosphorus, Çukurcuma (Istanbul's antique district) and home of the 'Museum of Innocence', and many many more places of interest! Too many to list! But 'Holy Coffee' is on my list and the family run Turkish restaurant next door, 'Çukurcuma Köftecisi' to try some traditional Turkish fare with my amazing Turkish boyfriend. :). I could go on and on about Istanbul and 'Museum of Innocence' but I have work to do! :))) enjoy this must-read novel!","Sep 27, 2015"
17980602,verde GRI,"I chose this book during my quest to get acquainted with recent Nobel winners (in literature). I should have probably started with (one of) Orhan Pamuk's books for which he got the prize as this book is not really rewarding, from a reader's point of view. I find the perspective on love and relationships very superficial, with a high degree of ambiguity that, taking into account it is rendered from an man's point of view, it is highly annoying. And the perspective on social transformations on the path of ""westernization"" a bit showy, stereotypical and, again, missing depth. I also find the main character hypocritical when mocking other wealthy Turks for their obsession with westernization since he himself seems to enjoy plunging into its symbols of elitism. Another instance where I find the entire tone of the story hypocritical is when mocking conservative wealthy Turks' choice of having multiple spouses. The main character himself exhibits no moral or sentimental barrier (on the contrary, is quite content with it) in engaging in two parallel relationships that would fulfill his needs both to maintain his social status and personal sexual and romantic aspirations.. However, if I were to put on the critic's hat and totally detach myself from the topics covered, I would definitely need to agree that the story is very well told. Surprisingly, I found it gets even better in the second or even third part of the book, leave aside it's getting a bit repetitive (and, hence, with a touch of boring).","Dec 09, 2015"
153169,Mommalibrarian,"I have doubts about the use of the word innocence in the title. Immaturity seems more appropriate. The narrator of the story is a rich male in a male-centric society who feels he is privileged to get whatever he wants. The book was a slow slog through years of his self-delusion. I made an editorial cut and stopped reading on page 490 of 532 when he admits 'pitying myself'. This book is one long pity party.. As far as it being a book about Turkey, the Turkish people and the 1970s we learn that there are both very rich and very poor people. There are religious or custom observing and European facing attitudes in different groups. Everyone smokes; all the time. There was 'still a shortage of running water (obliging even the richest neighborhoods to be supplied water by private trucks), and where the phones rarely worked."" There was also a lot of vandalism, frequent street fighting and military coups every ten years or so. There is a single, government controlled TV station. Clocks (necessary in order to manage religious observance) had been replaced by radio in the past and now by TV. At one time mathematics lessons were part of the radio programming! Cologne, not perfume, was shared by diners after a family meal and the 'driver's assistant offered each and every traveller at the beginning of a bus journey.' The position of women in society was very difficult and unlikely to change in the near future.","Mar 10, 2016"
47187040,Murat,"When I visited the museum, there is a section where the author, Orhan Pamuk, talks about the importance of the feelings that books provokes rather than the story itself. We hardly remember the details of the story shortly after reading the books but the emotions that arise submerge into our souls.. From the reviews, I see many non-Turkish readers are struggling to go through book. I respect all the non-Turkish readers who read or who are trying to read this book. I think it will be very hard to get the same taste that a Turkish who were raised in 60s or 70s and lived in Istanbul at some point in his / her life. You will get the story but not the same taste.. Lastly, you will truly enjoy the read, if you are person of obsessive nature.. ---.

2829391,Hashem,"I prefer to start my review by saying that this was not a joyride read. Kemal, the main protagonist is a wealthy man who falls in love with a beautiful girl and then becomes obsessed with her. He becomes so obsessed that he dedicates his life to just be around her and collect almost anything that she touches, be it a spoon, cigarette butts, saltshaker, scarf, earrings ... etc.. There were moments, when obsession really caught with Kemal that I wanted to slap him in the face and say ""Enough already! Stop being this pathetic and get a life, man!"" but this shows you how powerful and masterful Pamuk is at describing obsession.. What kept me going is how Pamuk used this thread of obsession and transferred me to Istanbul in the 70's and early 80's. Much like Marquez's and Nabokov's protagonists in Live in the time of Cholera and Loita (Both i chose as they look similar and probably a source of inspiration to Pamuk) Florintino Ariza and Humbert Humbert, Kemal is a tortured poet and his (Fermina Daza/ Lolita) is Fusun, who through his obsession and cultured soul, I was able to see her through his eyes and fall in love with!. And how beautiful the writing is! The minute i finished this book i smiled as Pamuk wrapped up the story with a victorious last sentence. For those who haven't read the book or are still reading it: Yes, it will feel tedious at times but i promise you that it has one of the best ending sentences to any book you will ever read :)","Apr 30, 2019"
23009270,Mélanie,"I am thinking about leaving the book with no rating because it left me touched to say the least, but neither happy, nor sad. I reckon every reader knows the saying: ""A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies."". All summer I've felt like I've experienced Kemal's life with him, his grief, his struggles, his tender emotions, his love and this was one of the reasons I didn't really think of this book as a page-turner, because it gripped me in the characters agony. I pitied him, sympathized with his love and loss and it wasn't until the last 50 pages that the book took a turn and the status-quo was changed.. I loved the ending, the witty idea of a museum of innocence, the kind of storytelling, the way things turned out and I must say this is the only part I truly, deeply enjoyed as a reader, although this same part left me perplex as a person.. Turkey has had a great influence in my country's culture and sometimes being able to understand what halva tasted like, or what Chinese dogs looked like or even being able to know how the character names sounded like and were identical to names common in my country made the book familiar.. I don't know if I recommend the book as I do with a great part of what I have read, but personally, after reading it, I won't forget to visit Istanbul and the Museum itself, since there's a surprise for every reader at the end.","Jul 18, 2014"
75947196,DwijoG,"Yes, this novel is over indulgent. It took me a while to get through, and for a long time,I kept comparing it (unfairly) to Love in the Time of Cholera. Unlike the luxurious pace of that novel, it felt as though Pamuk was intentionally keeping the flow clunky, to make the reader truly feel the agony of time passing under the weight of Kemal’s obsession with Fusun. And yet with a sleight of hand, he turns it all around in the end. The idea behind the museum of innocence succeeds in elevating the sentimentality and nostalgia that we harshly judge through most of the book. But I understand that it would be difficult to enjoy this turnaround unless one is sentimental by nature. What should we make of a rich man who squanders the opportunities handed to him, and reduces his life to pursuing his love lorn obsession? The museum is built as an answer to this question. It suggests a hypothesis that I personally find hard to disagree with - that age, time and perspective can render a chronicle of the seemingly most wasteful of lives as an epic tale of the human condition. I did not enjoy this book the entire period I read it. But in the end it left me overwhelmed with the gifts that my favorite works of art are prone to sharing - an experience, a memory and an understanding of another life.","Jan 12, 2018"
5862550,Sana,"Being more than 700 pages longs, it was truly a long, arduous journey for me to read The Museum of Innocence. I liked the book, but there were too many a times when I felt like I couldn't read anymore. It was the love and obsession that Kemal felt which kept me going on. I wanted to know the extent of it and to know his ultimate fate.. How clichéd but unlikely the story was! Love indeed knows no bounds. Yet, I wonder whether Füsun really knew what love was. Did either of them? Or was it just a strange case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder on Kemal's part and indifference and materialistic views on Füsun's? I never could decipher their thoughts.. But Orhan Pamuk has spent six years to write this book and the sentiment is not lost on me. I did associate with The Museum of Innocence at certain points in the story but I didn't like the title. Specifically, the word innocence.. It was a good book. However, the description of objects, the caresses and the never-ending thoughts about the past, lost the charm after a hundred or so pages. All I wanted was to read the last chapter and be done with it. So on the whole, I may forget the book but never a major chunk of Kemal's feelings; they hold a certain beauty. They took me to another world and a new one at that.","Jul 24, 2011"

When I saw this book, and the title,I thought that this might be a good book. But I'm wrong.. The story was just about an obsessed man, Kemal, wtih his lover Fusun, and their forbidden love. The book mostly consists of Kemal's exaggerated obsession of Fusun, which makes this book disgusting. Maybe Orhan Pamuk tried to make this story as a pure innocent complicated love story, which will touch the readers heart to pity the main character, as he can't be one with his 'true love'.. Instead of be touched, I felt disgusted. Severely disgusted. I can't pity the main character, seriously. Kemal is the worst main character I've ever read.. The story is written still with Pamuk style, a lot of detail,and himself as a character in this novel. Maybe because I've hated the story since the beginning, the story became very boring. I can't stand it to the last page, not to mention to finish it.... I like Orhan Pamuk, I love. My Name Is Red. but.

And I love the way Pamuk makes a cameo in his own book in the first half of the novel.. Told from Kemal's point of view, his feelings for his beautiful young cousin become a little draining and exhausting to read about for page after page. Really, the all the years he goes and eats dinner with her family are so slow moving and melancholy - you can't help agreeing with his mother that he's giving up too much of his life. Yet at times he makes you see what he sees: that his love for Fusun is beautiful and touching; that it is almost blissful just because it exists. (Although it certainly causes a lot of pain.). In the end, Pamuk is given a chance to have his own say from his own point of view, and it redeems so much of the novel. How much of how we see ourselves is accurate? How much of a person's story can only be known through others? I like that he made me ask these questions clearly at the end. Pamuk is certainly a gifted writer.","Apr 22, 2012"

Kemal and his fiancé, Sibel, meet Fusun where she is a shop girl in a boutique. Kemal begins a romantic affair with Fusun in the apartment where his mother stores her unwanted things. He breaks off his engagement but Fusun marries another man. For eight years Kemal pines for Fusun, going to her parents home for dinner, establishing a film company, Lemon Films, with the intention for Fusun to become a star. Over the years, Kemal collects many objects which his love, Fusun, has touched such as earrings, perfume bottles, salt and pepper shakers, etc., to feel closer to her and to remind him of his continued love for Fusun. Finally Fusun and her husband divorce, but Kemal and her relationship are not meant to be due to a tragedy. Kemal buys Fusun's parents home, lives there, and establishes ""The Museum of Innocence."" The reader finds that Kemal has commissioned Orhan Pamuk to write a novel about his love for Fusun and a guide for visitors to the museum so they will understand all the objects he has collected pertaining to Fusun.","Sep 17, 2014"

There are layers of symbolism. Color symbolism, people as metaphor for politics, stories within stories, religious references. I was a bit intimidated! I doubted that I was going to get everything there is to get out of this book, I knew I'd miss things.. But that's not why I didn't finish. On the surface, the story is about a hapless male who wants to screw around on his fiancee without having the foggiest idea about how either of the two women he's sleeping with feel about him. It was lack of self-awareness on the order of Humbert Humbert, only slightly less creepy. Not much, though. And when it comes right down to it, I don't want to be in this guy's head. The author is letting you know that there's a lot more going on there. But I didn't want to have to hear about this guy wallowing in narcissistic pain for hundreds of more pages.

The story takes us through the life of a rich Turkish man in his 30s, who has apparently everything: money, friends, a beautiful fiance and all the advantages that come with being part of Istambul's elite. And then one day he steps into a shop and recognizes a distant relation in the shopkeeper. And everything changes.. There are so many stages of life and love and emotion in this book: elation, passion, despair, and also the stillness (and boredom) of routine. Love to Kemal is an obsession that he feeds constantly not only by noticing the most intricate details of his loved one's complexion and personality, but also by compulsively collecting everything around her, everything that reminds him of her and of a particular time and place when they were in love. As you go through his journey, there is a point at which you think he's just creepy and crazy. And then, in the end, you somehow understand him. It is one of those books that becomes whole as you read its final line. It all makes sense and you cannot help but wonder at how creative and different from everything else you've read it really is.

2606757,Daven,"Well, I finished, at 530-some pages, and upon some reflection, I give The Museum of Innocence five stars. I thought about what draws me to choose the books I read; I'm hoping to encounter three-dimensional and complex characters and settings that surround me. And on these two criteria, this novel excels.. Not that it doesn't take some patience. Kemal, as protagonist and narrator, defines all-consuming obsession. It is confounding, and almost beyond suspension of disbelief, that the many characters around him enable this obsession,and how (until the end) he bears very few repercussions for his actions or the lives he impairs. But in the end, I was willing to accept as credible the unhealthy dynamics that cut across family and friends. There are many, many complexities here, and seemingly many, many motives across characters. It would be too simplistic to shrug this off as a simple story of one man's obsession, and to thereby grow impatient with the litany of Kemal's obsessive actions and thoughts. Granted, it is a story of obsession, but moreover, it is a story of extended family and friendship and culture, and I found it to be wholly engaging.","Jul 08, 2010"

I sorted through my bundle of memories, one by one, distracting myself until these memories would propel me even deeper in the void of the present moment. I discovered to seize upon an object of our common memories. I sometimes convinced myself that I was slowly growing accustomed to her absence. I would usually spend my two hours in the apartment daydreaming in bed, having selected some object charmed with the illusion of radiating the memories of our happiness. I was thinking about her even more obsessively. Time had not faded my memories. Did she really believe that other men could love her as I did. Don’t be afraid of life, Kemal Bay. I longed to run away from this house and these objects that had both healed me and reminded me of my affliction.

5911585,Aditya Patil,"A book this big takes you through a whirlwind of emotions. I started this book because of the Nobel-winning author and the fact that it was available in the library. It started with moderate pace and very happening storyline. I was immediately hooked. But after a certain stage, I had to put special efforts to read this book. The protagonist's pain and suffering were so intricately detailed that it was mentally exhausting. Kemal the protagonist's lament after his love, which in my opinion, tends to be borderline psychotic, was one of the saddest and most gruelling I have yet read. (Spoiler Alert) After the big middle chunk of the novel, it again becomes interesting, only to be faced with the death of his love. I was literally frustrated at that point. But as I experienced with Hemingway, Great authors have death as their big weapon in every love story they write. No great love story is without death I guess. Anyways, earlier I was going to give it a one or two stars, but with ending like that, it deserves one more star from my end. No judgment though.

To my mind, there is too much of Orhan Pamuk here, but too little of the story itself. I put four stars for the story just out of respect to the character and the confession he made, but not to the writer himself. Besides, the last ""revelatory"" chapter from Orhan Pamuk himself, where he mentions how some characters were asking him not to disclose personal facts in the book (i.e. Sibel), this part seems so cheesy for me, and does not look decent of the writer, as he could've kept the internal confidentiality and not reveal some of the delicate nuances which, perhaps, were not so important for him, but were so for the characters.","Oct 01, 2016"
301768,Judith,"This is a Turkish version of Sommerset Maugham's ""Of Human Bondage"", and if you can get past your frustration for our hero's eternally long quest to possess his beloved, then you will love this book. What I liked most about this book is that I listened to it as an audio, and enjoyed tremendously all the descriptions of Istanbul in the '70s.( & 80s) I was actually in Istanbul in the '70s so it was delightful to hear the stories about the Istanbul Hilton, the little restaurants, shops, the street scenes and the Bosphorus Sea. There's nothing better than hearing the correct pronunciation of all the words I would absolutely destroy if I tried to pronounce.. So this rich guy falls madly in love with this beautiful poor girl, on the eve of his engagement to a beautiful rich girl. That's the story, but it's set against the backdrop of this lovely and historic old city. This is not a page turner, but it is a lovely touching love story.","Feb 26, 2011"
7354398,Civi,"I went through different phases while reading this book. For the first 200-something pages I couldn't put it down. Shortly after that, it became really hard for me to trudge through - the narrator, an obsessive, love lorn kleptomaniac, was so self-absorbed and blinded by his ego that I just couldn't stand it. The whole time I kept thinking this book would have been far more interesting if I could get Fusun's version of the story, who throughout the whole book is nothing more than a spectacle, a muse, an object. The last chapter really salvages the book, and I enjoyed it, albeit post the 700-page mark. The writing is beautiful, but I don't think I would recommend this to anyone.. Side note: Investigating about the Museum of Innocence online after I finished reading it also made me appreciate the book more as a work of art and assuaged my feeling of utter disappointment whilst reading it.","Jan 05, 2013"
43477226,Todd Stockslager,"Review title: Love, Space, Time. The Museum of Innocence is a novel about a love story. It is also the catalog of the objects that tell the love story. It is a unique demonstration of the deep equivalence of love, space, and time. It is a novel that in lesser hands would be merely a novelty but is told (and translated from the original Turkish by Maureen Freely) so well that it richly deserves five stars as a classic.. The love story is told in first person retrospective by Kemal Basmaci, beginning his story when he is 30 years old and a wealthy Istanbul businessman engaged to his social peer Sibel. But just weeks before their engagement is celebrated at a lavish society ball, Kemal by chance meets and falls deeply in love with his 18 year old distant cousin Fusun. The straight line of the story proceeds through the way this reciprocated love effects his engagement and Kemal and Fusun's relationship in the context of the traditional class- and gender-conscious society in the Turkey of the mid 1970s when the novel begins. The relationships cycle from peaks of happiness to depths of despair as seen by Kemal and written looking back on these times based on his view of later events from his current position in life.. Along the way, Pamuk begins to inject indications that there is more to the story than the words of Kemal Basmaci. Kemal begins to refer to objects ""which you can see here"" as if he is pointing at things the reader can see, and you begin to realize that the Museum of the title is not just a metaphor, but a reality for Kemal. As we go deeper into the story Kemal begins to describe picking up objects that Fusun owns or touches (even cigarette butts she has smoked!) and describing the exact date and event in which the objects played a part. This is more than just a love story, but yet not the desperation of an obsession. In Chapter 17: My Whole Life depends on You Now, as he describes what he calls ""the happiest moment of my life"" (with over 60 of the 83 chapters remaining), he begins to consider the importance of the objects he is saving:. Anyone remotely interested in the politics of civilization will be aware that museums are the repositories of those things from which Western Civilization derives its wealth of knowledge, allowing it to rule the world, and likewise when the true collector, on whose efforts these museums depend, gathers together his first objects, he almost never asks himself what will be the ultimate fate of his hoard. When their first pieces passed into their hands, the first true collectors . . . initially never recognized these objects for what they were. (p. 73). At this point in his story he did not class himself as a collector, but he was learning the value of his objects.. The power of things inheres in the memories they gather up inside them, and also in the vicissitudes of our imagination, and our memory--of this there is no doubt. . . . . [These objects] remind me of the slow and humble rhythm of the routines that ruled our lives. (p. 324). It is through my reproduction of that enchanted space that museum visitors can wander, as if through Time (p. 355). Rhythms, space, Time. Pamuk has described in three simple words the powerful deep mystery of life, and of the love that makes it endurable and enduring. The concepts come powerfully together in the presence of the objects. I am writing part of this review at the National Historical Museum in Oslo where there is a traveling exhibition of some of the displays that Pamuk built to accompany each chapter. In fact, I had never heard of Pamuk before seeing the exhibit some months before, and read the book to understand the power of the displays (see. my review of the exhibition catalog. which I read after that first visit). On this second visit, carrying the just-finished novel in my hand as I looked up the chapter that went with each case, the objects in the cases took me right to the meaning and impact of the people and events on the page in ways that felt like this wasn't just a novel I had read, but people and places (and objects) that I knew and recognized.. In a way that feels like a perfectly natural piece of the book, Pamuk the author has Kemal the narrator mention the Pamuk family as a prominent Istanbul family, has Orhan invited to the engagement party, and describes him having a dance with Fusun there. This introduction makes sense when we learn that in fact because of Orhan's position in the same social circles and his knowledge of many of the characters Kemal has invited the fictional Orhan to write the catalog for the Museum of Innocence, in the form of a novel, which Orhan decides to write in.... first person retrospective in Kemal's voice! This gives Orhan and Kemal the chance in the last few chapters, as Kemal has now created his fictional museum (which the real Pamuk would later create in Istanbul, part of which I saw in Oslo), to discuss some of the events of the book so that we can learn how much of what we read was shaped through Kemal's eyes and how much through fictional Orhan's pen. In the interest of preserving the power of the unfolding story for the reader, I will give no more plot details.. Finally, the real and the fictional Pamuk explore the meaning of the Museum. ""Real museums are places where Time is transformed into Space,"" (p. 510) the fictional Pamuk writes in Kemal's voice. As Kemal describes to Pamuk the operating principles of the new museum (readers of the book can bring their copy, which will include in the text a facsimile of the museum's ticket, and have the page stamped to get one free entrance), he explains that in this Space ""visitors will lose all sense of Time."" (p. 520).. Love, Space, Time. The essence of life. This is a classic.","Oct 01, 2017"
4040350,Nathan Watling,"An extremely long and detailed account of a man's obsession with a girl. Pamuk's style is both a pro and a con. On one hand it successfully builds the sense of frustration and yearning to enable the reader to empathise with the main character, while on the other, at times, it's slow and drawn out causing actual frustration. It's an interesting insight into life in Turkish society at the time and the descriptions of my favourite parts of Istanbul were another feature. I'd definitely encourage readers to persevere","Jul 13, 2011"

32532774,Lisa,"Pamuk was already one of my favourite authors when I read his memoir of his beloved city - Istanbul - in conjunction with a family vacation there. What an amazing reading experience that was!. Imagine that old, old city, full of stories after centuries of human interaction, of cultural clashes and exchanges, of architectural wonders and wars of destruction.. And then imagine one of its most talented writers, a storyteller with the power of 1001 nights, telling the story of the city from his personal angle, sharing his historical knowledge, his family history, and personal relationships, both fictional and real.. Imagine walking the streets and recognising each cobblestone Pamuk mentions.. Imagine going to the markets and taking in the colours and flavours of the spices that he describes, hearing the voices of the lively sellers and buyers, engaged in an everyday dialogue that you might not understand, but feel close to all of a sudden, as you have the voice of Pamuk in your head.. Imagine feeling connected to a completely foreign world through the literary masterpiece of an author who knows how to cross the bridge between Asia and Europe, both literally and figuratively speaking!. Imagine moving around that beautiful, powerful city with your own family while stepping into the living-room of Pamuk's childhood home, meeting his relatives from different generations.. Imagine feeling the hüzün, the melancholy of Istanbul, almost as if it was possible to touch it physically, guided by Pamuk's experience of spiritual loss as a chain that links together a city in an eternal identity crisis:. ""For me it has always been a city of ruins and of end-of-empire melancholy. I’ve spent my life either battling with this melancholy or (like all İstanbullus) making it my own."". Identity crisis as the defining element of identity itself - that is an idea only literature can explain and transmit, in conjunction with the black and white photographs of a fictional past glory and the experience of intense life carried out on the streets of modern Istanbul.. As readable as Dickens' London tales and Zola's accounts of Paris, Pamuk gives his home town the best tribute possible: he invites literary travellers to participate in the imagination of its torn soul.. Brilliant!. I couldn't help seeing the city partially with the Scandinavian painter's eyes as well, seeing Zorn's painting of the Bosporus as a visual tribute to the melancholy beauty of local life that Pamuk celebrates..

94602,Kelly,"It is just lucky that I happened to read Menocal's. Ornament of the World. just before this, as it perfectly prepared me for the psychological labyrinth that is this book. It introduced me to a beautiful, helpful image for Pamuk's creation- the ""memory palaces"" and ""memory gardens"". This is not an introduction to Istanbul, it is a memory palace worthy of the wildest child's fantasies that haunt this tapestry. Perhaps John Adams, the minimalist composer, put it best when discussing his piece. On the Transmigration of Souls. , which was dedicated to 9/11, as he said:. ""I want to avoid words like 'requiem' or 'memorial' when describing this piece because they too easily suggest conventions that this piece doesn't share. If pressed, I'd probably call the piece a 'memory space.' It's a place where you can go and be alone with your thoughts and emotions. The link to a particular historical event - in this case to 9/11 - is there if you want to contemplate it. But I hope that the piece will summon human experience that goes beyond this particular event."". Similarly, Orhan Pamuk is not writing a Decline and Fall of Istanbul, in a strict economic and political reactionary sense. It's much more than that.. Pamuk chooses to depict the city in which he has lived all fifty years of his life through his own personal experience. This is an experience created out of the analysis and painting childhood memories, personal family tragedy and happiness, famous literary figures and creations, perspectives of newspapers, and reports of oddities. Added to this is descriptions of city-wide feelings, doings, and happenings, and most importantly, the concept of ""huzun"", a complicated, honorable, tenaciously held communal melancholy that Pamuk believes lies over the city, and of course- the endless big words East and West shoving their heads together in the midst of people just trying to live their lives.. Pamuk deals with big questions that fascinate me, such as- How do you go on when all that you know has died?, Do you have to burn the past in order to live in the present?, What does this word ""West"" mean, and whom does it mean this to?, How do you deal with multiple identities that tear you apart?, What is the psychological effect of the generations who repress themselves in order to get along with the new power nations on the block and survive?, How do you live when all the legends have done it better?, What /is/ this attachment we have for certain places?, Who is allowed to have a ""valid"" perspective on a place, or a culture, and why do perspectives from certain sources produce such anger?.. etc.. He also deals with questions on a smaller, more personal scale, which is why this is as much a personal psychological study as it is a national one- How do we become who we are?, Why must we be 'other', in order to see ourselves?, endless questions on personal identity and choice and conflicts with family, the past, the present, and the impossible future and trying to come up with choices that please or rebel against all.. Pamuk shows us an Istanbul drenched in longing- a longing that it appears nobody knows how to solve, caught between so many poles that people's heads spin. It is a place covered in huzun- the melancholy stressed above that somehow people just cannot get rid of, nearly a century after the Ottoman empire fell. He describes its honorable nature, its communal nature, the complicated opinions people have towards the past and the Westernizing present and future. Anyone who has paid attention to Turkish politics should recognize the pull between East and West where what people think is ""Western"" is sometimes misunderstood, and what being ""modern"" really is. He shows us a tortured place where even beauty is full of pain. The Bosphorous is presented as an endless possibility, a soothing slice of heaven surrounding the city, a place to escape at the beginning of the book, and the author's complicated outlook morphs it into a source of threats and danger by the end. He shows us stark pictures of the poverty of the ""wings"" of Istanbul, and then writes tortured chapters arguing with 19th century western authors who praised the ""picturesque"" beauty of the broken down areas of the city. He shows us a place where people ape ""Western"" thought and ideas and dress, and look down on anyone who isn't European enough, and yet a place where the newspapers publish glowing accounts of the poor neighborhoods with romanticized accounts of people living ""pure, Turkish, old fashioned"" lives every year, and where the checkered Ottoman past is more openly celebrated each year. He writes a chapter on ""Under Western Eyes,"" describing this conflict, and yet openly admits that it is Westerners who see the city the way that he does... and then he tortures himself about that too.. ... Pamuk's city is, needless to say perhaps after all that, a place where nobody can be easy with themselves, where they are going, where they are, or where they came from.. And in that way, I think, Pamuk is able to make a microcosm of our ever more complicated, globalized world, where the 19th century savior of identity, nationalism, is breaking down, and what will rise to replace it is so far uncertain. Therefore, I really don't care if you ever want to go to Istanbul or not, this book helped Orhan Pamuk win the Nobel Prize for a reason. I think that we would all be a little more patient with the world if everyone listened to what Pamuk has to say.. PS: Whoever put this in the ""Travel"" section next to ""Under the Tuscan Sun,""...

5100904,Mira ,"It feels very odd to be writing this review now, sitting in a car on my way back home, feeling bored and tired for no particular reason. And out of nowhere this book- which I finished more than a month ago, and entirely gave up on ever being able to write a decent review about- comes to my mind unbidden, as though deeply connected with my present state of mind. This is going to be one of the most personal reviews I’ll ever write, but that’s merely because. Istanbul: Memories and the City. has affected me personally, more than any other book ever has. Therefore I’m not going to praise Pamuk’s literary skills or the eloquence of the language. Nor am I going to comment on the exquisite picture of Istanbul which many westerners have described and which the author himself reflects upon many a time throughout the whole book. Those aspects enchanted me well enough, and they. do. give this book a great deal of its charm, but not as much as the relationship Pamuk shares with his city does. I have to say that I’ve also chosen a very odd timing to read this memoir. The few past months have been very busy and offered me very little time to read, and yet (stubbornly I guess, and to the amusement of many of my friends) I carried this book everywhere I went to make use of stolen free moments. It took me long to finish, naturally, but as John Green eloquently puts it: ‘ As I read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once."" The result was that I would read a few pages on the road, then find myself staring out of the window, watching many familiar objects as though for the first time. Has Jerusalem always been this beautiful? Has it always buzzed with noise and movement? I’d wonder sometimes. The magic in this book was that- while it offered nothing new except the details of Istanbul and its dark alleys which I’ve never been to- it reminded me to observe my own city with fresh eyes. As a painting, probably. Or a black and white sketch. Sometimes as a partner in an epic love story. Whatever it was, it helped me remember that familiarity does not necessarily guarantee perfect knowledge. That, in an earlier century, another person stood just like I did in a place he’d known since childhood, suddenly noticing something that has always been there but somehow at that particular moment felt new and unique. And why is that? Because he pretended to be a stranger, a “Westerner” in Pamuk’s case:. ‘So whenever I sense the absence of Western eyes, I become my own Westerner.’. Ch.31. ‘I would begin to observe myself from the outside, as if in a dream.’ Ch.34. At moments I felt that I’ve never related more to an author, or to his seeking the picturesque and the poetic. At others I felt pity. Pity that such a brilliant writer could be lost, much too taken with the European take on Istanbul in his youth. And so I found it only understandable for him to wonder by the end of the book :“Why should we expect a city to cure us of our spiritual pains?”. Perhaps we shouldn't. The melancholy which invades the very soul of these memoirs stems from the city itself- its ruins and dilapidated palaces, from the attempt to modernize (along with westernize) Turkey, and bury the deeply rooted history. This specific sentence stopped me because it occurred to me upon reading it, that cities with ever changing and usually painful histories must have similar emotional atmospheres. This is probably why I loved Pamuk’s walks to the poor neighborhoods and the ruins more than anything else; they represented the sort of poetic escapism which this book offered me on so many occasions. And it made me wonder more than ever whether Pamuk intended those memoirs to be a record of his own actions and decisions, or a tribute to the city he loved yet in which he was ever restless and wandering.. Reading this book, I was also reminded that stress teaches you to yearn for the unreachable, the unexpected. At least it taught me to. Reading under stress also gave this book a wholly different light from what I anticipated. Pamuk’s memoirs came as a stimulator for many feelings and urges instead of a stereotyped brochure about Istanbul’s charms. The more I read, the more I felt this irresistible urge to paint and write. I think that ,during those busy months, I’ve had more sketches around me begging to be worked on, than I ever had in my free time. The chapter named “Painting Istanbul” only helped to ignite those yearnings, and to make me pray for some leisure. And like Pamuk, I felt that ""painting allowed me to enter the scene on the canvas."". The positive pointed out, I have to say that this book was far from perfect. I wasn’t truly interested in Pamuk’s physical fantasies or his religious upbringing- which he mentioned often and which I found irrelevant and distracting most of the time. The narration, though beautiful and imaginative, tended sometimes towards repetition. All in all, the few negative points aside, Pamuk’s memoirs will always stay with me, and remind me of a specific period in my life when I decided to study architecture (the very branch of study the author chose then soon after decided to abandon for writing), and when I re-established my long-term passion for painting (also a hobby the author chose to quit long ago)..

68030,Jenny (Reading Envy),"Along with. The World's Literature group. , I have been reading a lot of books set in Turkey this year. Just check out what I've covered so far!. One of the best known Turkish authors has to be. Orhan Pamuk. . I've only managed to read one book of his so far, but there are many more on my to-read list to get to. I actually think reading this autobiography/memoir first will add some understanding to any of his books that I read in the future. It covers his childhood in Istanbul, up through his college years and the moment he decides to become a writer.. While this book came out in print in 2003, this audio edition was newly. released by Random House. in April. I had downloaded it but was listening to another book.. Then this happened:. I was already deeply interested in Turkey, even to the point of learning some of the language and the cuisine, but following the protests and police action in Twitter made me more interested in Istanbul.. Of course, the Istanbul of this book is several decades ago, but you can see traces of a history that breeds an environment where clashes between groups are not exactly unexpected, where poverty and control have always been issues in the background. Pamuk suggests that the most beautiful view of the city is from afar. I'm not sure he really means it, because he continues to return to this concept of. hüzün. , or melancholy, that he claims is part of the daily lived aesthetic in the life of an Istanbullu. That those living in the city. want. to feel. hüzün. , and don't feel as alive without it.. I know Pamuk has been criticized both by the government for not being religious enough and by the public for not being critical of the government enough, but this book makes it clear that he isn't all that interested in making a statement with his writing; he wants to describe. It makes so much sense now, to see his journey from painter to writer, to understand how this plays out in his writing. His descriptions of the black and white landscape of winter is central to. Snow. , the one book I've read.. I've had dreams about the Bosphorus, a strait in Istanbul separating Asia from Europe. Even though I've never been there and don't have reason to dream of it, I can see why you would. His descriptions of living within view of the river, of the fires and the commerce, made me long for this place I've never experienced.. The reader for the audiobook is John Lee, whose voice is very familiar to me as the reader for Ulysses. He does a good job with the pronunciation of Turkish names, but I kept expecting him to jump into ""Hoopsa, boyaboy, hoopsa!"" You know you listen to a lot of audiobooks when....","Jun 24, 2013"
66366804,Usman Hickmath,"Major part of the book describes what some poets, journalists and painters have written or painted about Istanbul during 19th century.. But, when I picked this one up after reading My Name is Red, the expectation was to know how Pamuk describes Istanbul and his life in that city, not what some 19th century unknown travellers and century old journalists with difficult names to pronounce had to say.. There were some interesting chapters, but we do not buy a highly priced book, printed on quality paper, packaged with a lovely cover and praised by many internationally acclaimed news papers only to read few chapters.. If you have not read Pamuk's works yet -  recommend to read his other works before Istanbul: Or you may overlook some great works of a master.","Apr 14, 2017"
21707944,Travelin,"There's really no nice way to say this. One of the deservedly obscure authors he spends a chapter praising is described as being some kind of pedophile. This isn't a pretend metaphor in Lolita, this is Pamuk's loving description of a nobody. If that's not enough, his best description of Istanbul, one of the largest cities today, and, more importantly, in history, is mopery about his apartment and decaying wooden houses near it. To spend a day in the tiny English section of a large bookstore and see nothing but Pamuk writings everywhere put me in a decidedly bad mood.. Original review:. This book can feel so perfectly paced and intimate because he spends a lifetime sitting indoors bemoaning an Istanbul which, he says, doesn't exist anymore. How he can remain isolated in a busy city year after year says more about him, his non-Turkish background, wealthier heritage, self-centered habits, etc. than it probably does about Istanbul.. I stopped reading just after he described his encyclopedic, unread and unwept literary heros, but regret avoiding Istanbul based on his descriptions. Turks don't seem to like him because of his comments about Armenians. His politics may sometimes have validity but he's mostly a spoiled man pretending to moan over himself..

26852,Eric,"Pamuk adds another layer to Istanbul’s proverbial description as “the bridge between east and west” by showing how the major Istanbul modernists – poet Yahya Kemal and novelist A.H. Tanpinar, new names to me, I have to follow up – derived a poetics of post-imperial ennui and urban decay from the melancholic image of their city recorded or dreamed by travelling French writers in the nineteenth century. “[T]he roots of our. hüzün. [urban melancholy] are European: the concept was first explored, expressed and poeticized in French,” he writes. And the nineteenth century French, the literary critics will tell you, were dealing with their own post-Napoleonic, post-imperial fatigue, and a. Mal du siècle. which made for what is called a “Late” Romanticism: dark, sexually anguished and routinely syphilitic (“The day the young writer corrects his first proofs he is as proud as the schoolboy who has just caught his first dose of the clap” - Baudelaire), as well as more perverse and pessimistic than the verdant and Liberty-extolling English variety (outcast, exiled, dark-locked Lord Byron being the founding hero, the revolting Satan for the French Romantics). I love that whole nervous crew; the Horror of Life Club, with their flamboyant despair and macabre brilliance (an 1874 entry of the Goncourt. Journal. begins, “Dinner at the Café Riche with Flaubert, Turgenev, Zola...We began a long discussion of the special aptitudes of writers suffering from constipation and diarrhea; and we went on to talk about the mechanics of the French language”). For such Istanbul visitors as Gautier, Nerval, and Flaubert melancholy was salutary and decadence authentic, the human norm. They relished the “Orient” for what they saw as its frank spectacles of violence and decay. Flaubert was especially taken with what he saw as the unworried kinship of pomp and squalor; writing a friend from Istanbul in November 1850, he marveled at the “splendid faces, iridescent existences that glisten and gleam, exceedingly various in their riches and robes, rich in filth, in their tatters and finery. And there beneath it all, the old immutable, perennial rascality.” – antiquity and authenticity in contrast to the European bourgeoisie’s fatuous conflation of moral and material progress, its aesthetics of engineering, its religion of convenience. When the Istanbul modernists, like all the other modernists, made their pilgrimages to the French wellsprings, they found their city already a literary image of melancholy – and just in time, what with Istanbul now the defunct capital of a fallen empire, poor, isolated, and afflicted by Westernizing republicans – a virulently progressive form of authoritarian bourgeois, in Pamuk’s picture – eager to raze the old Ottoman mansions and pour concrete Corbusian apartment blocks in their place. I thought of Baudelaire on the demolitions of medieval Paris – “the form of a city changes more quickly, alas! than the human heart.”. My favorite sections of the book were those devoted to Istanbul writers. Kemal and Tanpinar had two interesting associates, bachelor flâneurs like themselves: the Proust-like recluse Abdülhak Şinasi Hisar, and the historian Reşat Ekrem Koçu, compiler of the lurid and idiosyncratic. Istanbul Encyclopedia. (its entries on Ottoman torture devices and techniques thrilled young Orhan) who lived alone amid ceiling-high piles of nineteenth century newspapers and archival scraps. I love the image of a coterie of urban dreamers engrossed by a city, people for whom the layered landscape of their 2,500 year old home is a complete cosmos, the inexhaustible ground for diverse passions – creative and curatorial, novelistic and antiquarian; sexual, architectural, philosophical. (I think of Joseph Cornell reading Mallarmé after a day rummaging in New York City’s junk shops.) Pamuk is, of course, one of these writers. I was deeply impressed to read that the composition of his latest novel,. The Museum of Innocence. , was preceded by two decades of collecting hundreds of objects that would “belong” to the characters and figure in the book. And then he opened a real museum to display the collection. Elif Batuman in the. London Review of Books. :. The inspiration for the Museum of Innocence came to Pamuk in 1982, while he was having dinner with the last prince of the Ottoman dynasty. Exiled after the formation of the Turkish republic, the prince ended up in Alexandria and worked for decades at the Antoniadis Palace museum, first as a ticket collector and then as director. Now, back in Istanbul after a fifty-year exile, he needed a job. The guests discussed the delicate subject of employment for the straitened septuagenarian prince of a defunct empire. Someone said the Ihlamur Palace museum might need a guide: who better than the prince, who had lived there as a child? Pamuk was immediately taken by the idea of a man who outlives his era and becomes the guide to his own house-museum. He imagined how the prince would greet visitors – ‘Ladies and gentlemen! Seventy years ago, in this room, I sat with my aide-de-camp and studied mathematics!’ – before crossing the velvet cordon to sit once more at his childhood desk, demonstrating how he had held the pencil and ruler.. Ten years later, Pamuk came up with an insane plan: to write a novel in the form of a museum catalogue, while simultaneously building the museum to which it referred. The plot of the novel would be fairly straightforward: over many years, an unhappy lover contrives to steal a large number of objects belonging to his unattainable beloved, after whose untimely death he proceeds to buy her family’s house and turn it into a museum. You might think that Pamuk’s first step, as a writer, would have been to start writing. In fact, his first step was to contact a real-estate agent. He needed to buy a house for his future heroine, Füsun. During the 1990s, Pamuk visited hundreds of properties, trying to imagine Füsun and her parents living in them. It was beyond his means to purchase a whole building in Nişantaşi, the posh neighbourhood inhabited by Kemal, the hero of the novel. He could afford a single floor in a stone building in the old Ottoman commercial centre of Galata, but then the remodelling would be difficult.... For the next ten years, writing and shopping proceeded in a dialectical relationship. Pamuk would buy objects that caught his eye, and wait for the novel to ‘swallow’ them, demanding, in the process, the purchase of further objects. Occasionally an object refused to be swallowed, as happened with some carriage lanterns and an old gas meter. Pamuk published The Museum of Innocence in 2008. It resembles less a museum catalogue than a 600-page audio guide. A ticket printed in the back of each copy grants one free entry to the museum. By that point he had already acquired nearly all of Füsun’s belongings, so the museum could, in theory, have opened the next day. But Pamuk was worried about the example of Edouard Dujardin, the French writer sometimes credited with pioneering, in a largely forgotten text called Les Lauriers sont coupés, the stream of consciousness. Pamuk didn’t want to be Dujardin. He wanted to be Joyce. It wasn’t enough just to build the world’s first synergetic novel-museum. The museum had to be a thing of beauty. He hired a team of artists and curators and worked full time in the museum for several months, taking naps on Kemal’s bed in the attic.. http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n11/elif-bat...","Jul 05, 2012"
1605591,Christine,"This is the second book by Pamuk that I have read. I would like to point out that it seems that this book should be read either before or after. The Museum of Innocence. because I found myself making it notes of where the novel and this memoir collide.. I've never been to Istanbul, but now I want to go. What Pamuk does is not only describe his family but a city as a conflict between East and West. While it is not something that my own western city feels, it is somewhat akin to the feeling that Philadelphia has of being mashed between N.Y. and D.C. (Though in this day and age, it is a good thing that everyone forgets about us).. The book is part biography and part meditation on culture and its feeling of lost youth and innocence carries though to. The Museum of Innocence. . There are some places in the novel where you will laugh out aloud, for example where Pamuk apolgies to everyone he imagined killing or dying. There are also some extremely moving passages, not just in describing his family, or the feeling of Istanbul, but his only place in society.. I do wish, however, that more infromation about the pictures was given and I do wish that they had captions.","Jan 03, 2011"
1887310,Irene,"This is a duel memoir, that of the author’s first twenty years of life and that of Istanbul during the same period. Pamuk has a poet’s voice. By that, I don’t mean that he uses flowery or metaphoric language, but rather that he has the ability to conjure the abstract into palpable form: the atmosphere of a neighborhood, the bonds in a family, the mood of a people. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book that lacked any plot or narrative tension. I must have been in just the right mood.","Aug 07, 2016"
58296635,Sidharth Vardhan,"The sufi poets often compare their love for God to that of legendary lovers like Laila-Majnu and Heer-Ranjha for each other. This love which is just a painful longing (all those love stories are of star crossed lovers) for something worth annihilating oneself for - is called 'Huzun'. Despite its being melancholic, they still prefer having it - having an unrequited love is better than having none.. Writers, the ones I like, often have little such love for God. Some of them seem to searching for such subjects aimlessly. Some seem to attach it to places and times - the best examples in this regard are One Hundred Years of Solitude and Love in times of Cholera by Marquez (both yearning for a Latin America of older times) Midnight's children (India) and Shalimar the Clown (Kashmir) by Salman Rushdi and Watermark (Venice) by Joseph Brodesky.. Pamuk's Istanbul is now added to the list. As he looks back longingly to his childhood memories, he finds it paralleled in Istanbul's longing for older times. A city that seems to be proud of its ruins and is yet desperate for modernisation, Istanbul has the paradoxical life of many other cities of East.. Besides being a memoir, this book is also a very experimental travel guide which doesn't describe the big monuments but describes what it is to live in it - the beautiful views it sometimes creates and the forgotten streets.","Oct 04, 2018"
3361474,Jennifer,"Were Orhan Pamuk active on Twitter back when he was writing. Istanbul: Memories and the City. he could have saved himself and his readers a great deal of time and frustration by simply distilling this work down to ""Boo fucking hoo #firstworldproblems"" and leaving it at that.. Instead, we're left to slog through four hundred pages of angsty ennui which purport to represent the zeitgeist of a city that mourns the days it stood at the center of the world but in fact do little more than chronicle the thin complaints of a wealthy man who never manages to move out of his mother's house. It would be fine if melancholy simply pervaded Pamuk's memoirs as he spun tales of his youth, but there are almost no tales told here, just endless, smothering atmosphere that reminded me of nothing so much as the narrator in David Foster Wallace's ""The Depressed Person."". I took this with me to Turkey and was never so happy as when I finished and could dump it in the library of a B&B in Sirince and snag an Agatha Christie novel instead.

2327886,Jonfaith,"Hüzün does not just paralyze the inhabitants of Istanbul, it also gives them poetic license to be paralyzed.. And likewise this is a deeply moving memoir of a life lived in Istanbul. The Turkish tradition of melancholy is brought to focus by accounts of the author's life in the city and bejeweled by haunting photographs. This is winding stroll the history -- the collapse of the Ottoman era -- and through memory. Pamuk's grandfather was was quite wealthy but his two sons apparently lacked financial panache.. This book is peculiar in that it is composed of short thematic chapters and there is a visible distance between such, even if a gestalt of sorts occurs. Each centers about an aspect of an earlier Istanbul or a theme from Pamuk's ancestry or childhood. There are allusions to a collector's zeal and maintaining these links to an earlier Istanbul. Postcards and popular encyclopedias earn a gold standard in the mind of the author.. Straddling the East and West, Europe and Asia, Istanbul contends with an identity crisis. One that Pamuk iterates in his exploration of travel literature by Western authors : principally Nerval, Gautier and Flaubert, though Sam Clemons does receive a nod.. The final twenty percent of the work appears to be culled from the analyst's couch. There are tensions with his siblings and parents, his move away from architecture, his thwarted first love and ultimately the desire to renounce his bourgeois upbringing by becoming an author. It is a measure of cliché, but there's an earnest edge to it, one that appears in perfect accord with moonlit walks alongside the Bosporus.","Jul 11, 2020"
865180,Cortney,"This was not, first of all, the book I espected it to be. It was not truly an autobiography of the author, who gave nothing at all away, at least in the context of the west (perhaps it would shock conservative Turks that he apparently had a sexual relationship with a girl as a young man, but I don't know what Turkish mores are, so I shouldn't judge) and gave away little in terms of the city that he was supposedly also biographying. It gave tantalising hints of things, and there were potential threads to follow, but overall, I felt that it wasn't worth the read.. The book contains pictures, but since none of them are captioned it is impossible to know why the author chose them, what point they illustrate in many cases, or who is in them in the case of the occasional family photo. It might be a very good book in the larger context of Turkish works, but I don't feel that it's very good in my context.","Feb 01, 2008"

He opens with a statement that from a very young age he suspected that somewhere in the streets of Istanbul, there lived another Orhan so much like him that he could pass for his twin, even his double. In the last chapter, his father apparently led a double life just like in his imagination.. Pamuk manages to intermingle the story about Istanbul and himself - reflecting each other along the way. The writing style is mostly visual - his trademark - and of course when it comes to sensitive or personal facts, he would be cheeky enough to sort of hide it from the readers, certainly without compromising the dramatic effect nor the reading pleasure.. This intricate prose taught me about ""huzün"" - the collective melancholia of istanbul and its people, being a former high civilization plummeted into poverty and defeat. It also taught me about the radical westernism who wish Turkey to be uprooted from its traditions and history. Yet reflectively, this two elements are those playing with his own life. Reading his lamentation, I am so glad I am not in his shoes.. Picked up this book after reading his later book ""Other Colours"" mentioning that this book has disturbed his relationship with his mother.

257105,Ayu Palar,"About a year ago, when I was brainstorming the topic for my master’s thesis, I stumbled upon the idea of space and identity relationship. Since then, I’ve always been interested in how space and place can affect the formation of one’s self. Reading. Istanbul. has strengthened that particular idea. Not only describing the physical condition of Istanbul, Orhan Pamuk also wrote about his love-hate relationship with the city. Istanbul isn’t just his home; it is the city that always inspires him.. I appreciate Pamuk’s honesty in this memoir. In a frank way, he shares how the Istanbullus are trapped between the two worlds, the so called West and East. Pamuk has been raised in a Western way, by which he encountered many great authors that influence him. Yet it saddens him how westernization indirectly leads to poverty. Not all aspects of Istanbul are ready for modernization.. However, in some parts, Pamuk’s honesty annoys me a bit. He talks about his unhappy family, and I have to say that there are parts that make me think he is unfair to his mother. I hardly remember any sentence that says something positive about his mother, besides her beauty. On the other hand, my most favourite chapter is the one about religion. Pamuk’s attitude towards religion at the same time represents the ambiguity that most Istanbullus have to face. West in mind, yet East in heart. It’s also interesting that he imagines God as a woman, different with the general image of God that people often have.. Istanbul. is written passionately and along with.

This book is a biography of the city (during a 100 hundred year span from the 1850's - 1970's). This book is also an autobiography of the author from infancy up to the moment he decided to be an author (early 1970's). The only drawback is that the black/and white images don't have captions so I didn't know what I was looking at, most of the time. I believe the captions were left out intentionally to create a feeling of mystery.. This book contains anecdotes from travellers and authors from the west who visited Istanbul (Gautier, Flaubert etc), painters and native authors and photographers..

Unfortunately this site is much too btilliant and i can say almost professional , in any case for me.What can I say about the books facing you_Nothing much or very far off the mark.. This book for instance I have read , appreciate it for its quality of honesty facing the childhood in one's beloved city., The book is an image of growing up , considering the city with curiosity, love wonder, undestending, calm tranquility in front of its past and present,in front of its strivings and deceptions, about men and women living there and leaving their mark on the city horizons. He said Istanbul is a sad city, the city with a sad face. All grand cities are sad, all persons who have lived are sad. That's because they have lived curiously and intensely and loved it Like Baudelaire in Spleen de Paris ot Les fleurs du Mal , in his Parisian landscapes - those that live, like Sphinx , feel memories opened and unopened of past centuries, only to be gleaned at, and loved for this well of surprises. One can guess at the perfumes of Istanbul and be caught in their vortex. It is a city of dreams, where one has his memories to lean and reflect on. Creative individuals, whether poets or painters, haunt the landscapes of their beloved cities, past or present, in search of stories for inspiration which imprint on their minds as a song a tableau, like Parisean tablueaux or Spleen de Paris. No wonder Baudelaire dedicated his Spleen to his friend and painter. Orhan Pamuk wanted to be a painter, had the vocation but painting his hard for living Better to be a popular novelist. Love is so exacting and the city demands constant revalue from Orhan, as a writer and author but not only from himbut from all those wholived and have lived in the ciity. It is the cityof sad people, people with long faces. Pamuk's itiniary through Istanboul follows the course of his life movement, together as its history markings convering by way of adlthood and love to maturity, with Istanbul on its fore, with its people grappling in it. Love and vocation are so linked in this confession, witnessing both an epoch and beyond. Love and vocation strenghthen love of the city like a constant returning point, like a hub where one return, like a haven. This is a book of one native city but also a book of an epoch of the emerging writer,one that has learn to love. This book isa life buoy of the man an inididual having talent for saying things about the universe he mows best. It is creed, his growing to maturity and his acceptance of himself as the inhabitant of this world Love is a basis in this travalogue through the city but also with personal touches of an autobiogrephy, Istanbul he knows best both literary, culturally, family-like civilisation like dispersing in by memorable figures who made Istanbul in however their personal way because they were its citizens and loved the city.. This is ,my last review on this lovely site. I have found out a site less brillant than GR but the one which is more suitable to me. So long and keep well. Ce livre, comme recits de Pamuk est un temoignage de l'homme conscient de sa vie et de son entourage. Il a maitrise son travail d'ecriture, son point de vue,l'a aiguise a l'aide de son interieur en lui ,cet amour qu'il porte pour la ville et ses habitants. Il les a compris dans leurs deceptions et leurs aspirations. Il les sait differents mais il les croit surpris et indecis devant l'histoire. Ils sont riches par leurs temoignages - il les comprend dans la solitude du choix historique et present. Mais il comprend, c'est la vie et l'homme est ainsi , il tourne son regard ailleurs ou vers le passe. Et le present leur echappe, qui est le necessaire C'est beau livre,facile a lire et comme ceux d'Orhan , emouvants. Soyez joyeux et bien portants devant le livre de votre destin","May 02, 2020"
4679583,Myles,"Before I read Orhan Pamuk's Istanbul several of my friends told me how much fun they had visiting the city with its historical palaces and fabulous mosques. I wanted to visit the street markets and the seasides. I've read enough history about Byzantium and the Ottomans to whet my interest in the ruins of empires gone by.. But Pamuk has painted such a grim, dirty, and poor city that it left me wondering if my friends visited the same town. Dirt and crumbling mansions. Crashing pollution. Fires. Hobos and homeless. Antiquated buildings and transportation. Old ferries. Old men in skull caps and chattering aunties. Civic corruption. My goodness. This could be Naples. Or Detroit.. It seems the national passion is melancholy. Too much east and not enough west. Maybe, too much crappy west and not enough appreciation of east.. Is this a place I want to visit?. Maybe.. There is so much humour and self loathing in the book to warrant a second look. As if maybe Pamuk is making a little fun at himself.. It is certainly well worth the read about Turkish poets and novelists and historians. About how French writers and artists viewed the city from the vantage point of the 19th century. And about how Pamuk traces his own development as a writer.. Pamuk and I are different type of people, although we are similar in age. He drastically tried to leave his identity as a middle class Istanbulu (I love that word) to blossom as a writer. Like him as a teenager I roamed the streets and went for walks that lasted for hours. For him it meant becoming a writer. For me it meant becoming nothing. I fell under the spell of a turn of the century novel called The Man Without Qualities. It struck me that abandoning the preconceptions of who I was or who I ought to be gave me the freedom to discover much more about life.. Sans judgements. Sans status. Sans expectations.. I became a carpenter, an accountant, a forensic auditor, a retailer, a historian, an actor. Anything and nothing. I stopped writing when I stopped having anything of meaning to say. In that nothingness came freedom.. I wonder if becoming a writer has given Pamuk freedom. I wonder if he has forgiven his father for being a lecher.","Mar 24, 2015"
52238,Judy,"A book that makes me want to visit Istanbul just to walk around and see the sights that Pamuk describes and develops in this book. Reading his prose is an experience of “painterly” writing, where you cannot help but have a vivid image in your head of the surroundings and atmosphere conjured up with the words. But it is also a portrait of a sensitive young boy coming of age in a place and time where the borders between worlds are unpredictable. Not only are the Western and Eastern worlds in conflict, but also the world of family secrets and respectability.. This was my introduction to the author’s writing and he’s jumped onto my favorite author list as a result. I’m anticipating reading his other books, especially his fiction.","Jul 14, 2013"
1423032,Ingy,"(Sorry for the English.. This was originally written for the book discussion. here. ). ****. This is a very rich book.. Rich in emotions, sadness, life, even references!. It takes you deep into the streets of Istanbul, the real Istanbul, not tourist's Istanbul.. It will make you fall in love with Bosphorus, and feel the great attachment of the people of Istanbul to it.. Like it's somehow the main pillar or their very own existence.. I really understood this ""dependence"" feeling that author was talking about, it's like what Egyptians feel about the Nile... I really liked the ""honesty"" of the writer.. the way he exposes everything he witnessed in his society, and himself without trying to ""beautify"" anything... Many people talk about the ""identity crisis"" Turkish must have.. Are they Westerners, or Easterners, or simply Turkish?... This confusion, you can feel it in the city, the buildings, the sadness.. And it's not an identity crisis as it's a kind of a ""longing to the best, but feeling nostalgic about the past""... I don't know.. I don't think I can ever express it better than the author himself who took over 400 pages to try to describe this very special ""thing"" about his city! And then, reflecting this beautifully on himself... Each of the Chapters gave me something to think of.. A part of the story, before it all come together at the end to lead the a certain ending.. So let me tell you what I picked up all the way as the story goes.... ****. I loved the chapter ""Black and White"".. It's so poetic, so much nostalgia... I love it when the city imprints a certain vision in your mind.. especially one that is so dramatic.. The Author dedicated tow chapter to talk about Bosphorus.. They are fantastic! With all the paintings about the city that Pamuk describes.. It's great.. I'm trying to keep track of all of the paintings and painters he mentioned.. I'll try hard... The tenth chapter ""Sadness"".. It's like he's describing the state of my city, ""Cairo"".. I think all cities with ancient glory that faded away have the same state... 19th chapter: ""Conquest or decline? The Turkification of Constantinople"". This is a very interesting chapter, and it reminds me of the old say that history is always biased... If you say ""conquest"" it means you're pro-Ottoman, but if you say ""decline"" then you're pro- Greek/ Western civilization... There is no ""objective term"" to describe such a major historic event... 20th chapter: ""Religion"".. It was very funny to see the author version of ""God"" :D. And very interesting to see how religion falls in the hierarchy of priorities in republican Turkey... It's very interesting for me in particular as a Muslim in a Muslim society, to see what other courses did other societies choose.. And last but not least.. 21st chapter: ""The rich"".. And as much as this chapter was funny in some parts, it was also painful in other parts.. to see all these once part of powerful ruling families in an empire that dominated almost half the globe, now poor, fighting each other, and struggling just to survive.. They are the perfect incarnation of the real fall of the Ottoman Empire.. Another chapter that touched me deeply, the 25th: where he talks about the ""western"" view to th city.. This is another common thing with my city, in a way... We too care about how others see us.. I find it so sad!. But what struck me the most was his talk about the poor neighborhoods in Istanbul (chapter 27).. And how those who don't live in it see them beautiful despite all the poverty... I don't know why, but misery and filthy buildings can be appealing to those who don't actually live in such places... Then, came ""First Love"" is a heart- breaking chapter.. You can feel the author's sadness as he writes about it even now.. It's the only chapter that has no photographers of Istanbul, and almost no photos at all except for one painting that is essential for this chapter.... ****. The last chapter was kind of a psychological epic! The struggle of the writer with himself and the social ordinary views, or even clichees (embodied in the mother, the broken mother) the views about life, future, love, even career.. Views that are the result of the ""melancholia"" and tough life of the people, or should I say, of Istanbul itself... And the simplicity of the decision the author took, in one sentence, that was in fact not simple at all, but the result of a really hard struggle.... By the end of the book, things starts to fall into their places.. All events of the life of the young Orhan (the book ends at the time Orhan was 19 years old) and his memories; the stories of Istanbul and its streets that in time the reader starts to feel so familiar with it, and feels like he is living in this place; the fist love, the first heart-break; all of this, at last, start to come together into one last epic chapter that leads to the end.. Or should I say, the beginning?. ****. As I said, it's a very ""rich"" book.. It's not just a man talking about his memories.. It's a life story beautifully entangled with the story of a city... And cities can tell the most beautiful stories...","Oct 06, 2011"
7584700,Keertana,"Pamuk's nonfiction work, filled with memories from his childhood and life in Istanbul, is beautiful. It is not just a homage to this brilliant city, but to its people and culture and history and way of life. The chapters don't just chronicle Pamuk's mischief while growing up or his first loves and family tensions, it also discusses--at length--writers and artists who have been just as in love with Istanbul as Pamuk himself. It touches upon Istanbul's past and its resilience; its view from Western eyes and other European ones as well. It's a thorough, wonderful piece that I'm so glad I picked up.. I've been low-key obsessed with Istanbul for awhile now--this city is #1 on my bucket list and I'm dying to get on a flight there this second. And I really do think that, in order to get through this book, you have to be a little bit in love with Istanbul. Or the idea of it. Because this memoir is LONG and it isn't always as easy to get through as the first few chapters suggest. Somehow, I found my interest waning as the book wore on. Perhaps it's because I don't really a ton of nonfiction, or maybe it's just that some of the stories in this were a lot better than some of the others. If a chapter was good, it was brilliant; you found yourself through it. If a chapter wasn't great, you were lost: to flip the page or skip the chapter? That became the question.. Still, I'd recommend this book with few reservations and, duh, a trip to Istanbul. Someday.","Jun 05, 2016"
29160274,Czarny Pies,"This book is great fun that is sure to please any Good Read member as people who join Good Reads enjoy books more than anything else. The memories of a football player are about kicking a ball if you are European or butting your head against other heads if you are an American. However, the memoires of an author are about reading books and what can be more interesting than that - reading about reading.. Pamuk's Istanbul will give the greatest pleasure to those who know French literature as it is the melancholy Frenchmen like Theophile Gauthier who have written the best Istanbul However, there is still plenty in this book for the English reader. Istanbul although theoretically in Asia occupies both continents in fact. It is an adventure in exotic travel than no other city in the world.. I share utterly Pamuk's deep and profound disappointment that Herge never set a TinTin Graphic Novel in Istanbul. Fortunately the movie industry has come to our rescue. In 1961, the French released Tintin and the Golden Fleece (Tintin et le mystère de la Toison d'Or) set in Istanbul and featuring George Wilson (father of Lambert Wilson) as the unforgettable Captain Haddock. I advise French readers to watch the Toison d'Or with their children or grandchildren after reading Pamuk's book which is a delightful homage to the high and low culture inspired by Istanbul.","Oct 09, 2014"
14180908,Adrian Buck,"I misunderstood the subtitle; I didn't realise this was one set of personal memories, I thought it would be about how collective memory creates our ideas of a city. As it is, a sort of combination of. Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. and. Magic Prague. it doesn't succeed as either. I learnt neither very much about Istanbul nor about Orhan Pamuk.. Istanbul is the only Muslim city I have spent any time in, and my abiding memory is how much a stranger this made me feel; the absence of women at work, the difficulty of getting an alcoholic drink. Pamuk spends much time exploring the failing struggle of Istanbulus to make their city a western one under the secular Nationalist regime. Now that the regime is taking Turkey back to Islam, you have to wonder how transient Pamuk's memories of the city are.","Dec 03, 2012"
13827890,Kevin,"In this work of Pamuk I see myself more vividly..... A must read for those who love history and for those who have experienced Hüzün.. Highly involving, entertaining and thought provoking. Wanted to give it 6 points.. It's a great work from a great author.","Jun 09, 2014"
16819062,صفية,"It's amazing how the writer brilliantly recounted the story of the city in his autobiography:. ""I have described Istanbul when describing myself, and described myself when describing Istanbul.."". One can seldom walk in Istanbul now without thinking of the details he put in this book.. ""Notions of beauty or of the landscape of a city are inevitably intertwined with our memories: This book is the product of that exchange."". And it was not just how this was the least boring literary autobiography that I've ever read, but also the effortless prose that streams from his hands recalling everything literary related to the city, and that has at some point influence Orhan to write one day.. ""Gustave Flaubert, who visited Istanbul 102 years before my birth, was struck by the variety of life in its teeming streets; in one of his letters he predicted that in a century’s time it would be the capital of the world."". ""Théophile Gautier, paid a visit to Istanbul."". ... as did Gérard de Nerval, Maxime du Camp and maybe if my memory serves me right, Victor Hugo as well, and that made it easier for me to relate to, since I was on good terms with French Classics.... As I was holding the deluxe edition with its marvellous pictures collection I have stopped many times to admire those timeless perspectives. Him being an artist, and an architecture uni dropout, in my opinion shaped his aesthetics in picking the right pictures:I was subjugated by their 'poiesis', bringing forth a feeling of familiarity and beauty that didn't exist before his words.. ""The Bosphorus was the key, the heart of the geopolitical world, and this was why all the nations of the world and all their armies and most especially the Russians wanted to take possession of our beautiful Bosphorus."". ""There is an art to viewing a photograph and describing it with imagination and erudition."". And let's just dwell on the beauty of keeping what he always waned to become to the last sentence/word in his autobiography :. ""I don't want to be an artist,"" I said.""I'm going to be a writer."". I'd love to end my review on a Hüzün note, since it struck a chord with my adolescent self who was keen on losing herself in Greek tragedies, and that later on impacted on my reading passion. Although moderate now, I can go on re-reading everything Pamuk said about Hüzün tirelessly :. ""According to El Kindi, hüzün was associated not just with the loss or death of a loved one but also with other spiritual afflictions, like anger, love, rancor, and groundless fear."". ""Hüzün does not just paralyze the inhabitants of Istanbul; it also gives them poetic license to be paralyzed."". ""Hüzün teaches endurance in times of poverty and deprivation; it also encourages us to read life and the history of the city in reverse. It allows the people of Istanbul to think of defeat and poverty not as a historical end point but as an honorable beginning, fixed long before they were born."". ""Likewise, the hüzün in Turkish poetry after the foundation of the Republic, as it too expresses the same grief that no one can or would wish to escape, an ache that finally saves our souls and also gives them depth."". Special Architectural Mention:. Glad that I found on these pages a reference of one of my favourite books in architecture,. The Seven Lamps of Architecture. :. ""In The Seven Lamps of Architecture, John Ruskin devotes much of the chapter entitled “Memory” to the beauties of the picturesque, attributing the particular beauty of this sort of architecture (as opposed to that of carefully planned classical forms) to its “accidental” nature."". ""For Ruskin, picturesque beauty rises out of details that emerge only after a building has been standing for hundreds of years, from the ivy, herbs, and grassy meadows that surround it, from the rocks in the distance, the clouds in the sky, and the choppy sea."". I think that this might be my favourite book by Orhan Pamuk, I laughed, felt sad and was hopeful along the book, and on top of all I was eager to learn that it was all real...","Oct 19, 2019"
442654,Andrew,"Turns out that Orhan Pamuk, the Middle East's major proponent of cryptic, melancholy fiction can produce equally cryptic, melancholy memoirs. Pamuk's Istanbul isn't sunshine and minarets and kebabs like you'd imagine-- it's gloomy winter nights, half-demolished Ottoman houses, sunken ships, and interminable desperation due to its location between continents. Like Pessoa in Lisbon and Borges in Buenos Aires, Pamuk inverts the common image of Mediterranean life, and tells his story as a lifelong Istanbullu. Perhaps the best analogy I can draw is to Guy Maddin's ""My Winnipeg,"" a likewise surreal, gloomy exploration of cityspace and personal memory. Books like this are my bread and butter.","Dec 08, 2015"
7199941,Campbell,"A toweringly Gothic, heartbreakingly melancholic, love letter to the city of Istanbul, as it existed both in actuality and the backward-focused mind's eye of the author.. If I had any personal connection to the city at all, if I'd even visited it onceuponatime, this would have been an unquestionable five stars, such was the naked evocative power of this memoir.. Even as it stands however, I challenge anyone to read this and not wish to run off immediately and see it for themselves. I'll have to settle for Google Earth. For now.","Jul 11, 2017"
7626239,Giray,"This is likely the most difficult and personal review I've had to write, because of two reasons: liking Orhan Pamuk is kind of a taboo in Turkey, and having read this book in English, I have an odd traitor guilt (Pamuk himself is sometimes criticized as having a poor command of Turkish, so the translation might be better). When I wanted to discuss his work among his peers (my father, his friends, etc.), I was often shunned or scoffed at - he was or is an imposter, who came from wealth, observed and learned the city from his ivory tower (or his balconies) and his depiction of people tends to be overly romantic and Westernized. In the Western world, however, his skill and work are inarguably acclaimed and well esteemed. In. İstanbul. , his mastery is no different.. These criticisms may be partially true (and partially the reason I considered docking a star), but Pamuk's honesty and vulnerability about himself help him refine one of the most compassionate pieces of writing on the city. Through him, I was able to make better sense of where I grew up, what this East-West polarization meant for me in my upbringing. For the first time in my life, maybe, I found a part of my identity in literature, and that was an exhilarating experience, so I have to thank Pamuk for it. All this happened because he was willing to open up his imagination to the reader in the context of the city, the place I was lucky to have experienced until the age of 19, which coincides with the age he finalizes his memoir's timeline.. Hüzün. is indeed the color of Istanbul, and I really enjoyed finding why in this book. It was different from what the mainstream media fed me, mostly through TV or history books, now I am inspired to read on different shades of the city. Sure, he over-romanticizes things and sometimes gets drowned in a sense of self-importance, the navel-gazing becomes a tired act, and he fails to meet the regular people of the city, whom he solely values for their aesthetic value,. but so do I. . That's what made the book special for me.. I wholly recommend this book to all my. İstanbullu. friends. Maybe it will help them imagine a different painting for their love-hate relationship with the city.","Jan 22, 2020"
5905580,Lysergius,"A wonderfully evocative portrait of the city of Istanbul, combined with an account of the author's upbringing and coming of age in the city.. Istanbul, or Constantinople as it was once known, is no longer the capital of the Ottoman Empire, nor in fact of Turkey, and it is this decline and fall that provides the substance of the book. Hüzün, a special form of melancholy finds it source in this decline, in the ramshackle wooden mansions in the decline of all that made Istanbul a great city. This combined with the Turkish republic's attempt to westernise, to shed the Ottoman past combines to produce a rich texture to the writer's recollections.. This search for a personal identity, for a unique being only takes shape for the writer when he embraces Istanbul in all its variety, and identifies fully with it.","Sep 04, 2017"
9024792,Mike Keirsbilck,"This is a cleverly en beautifully written book. Unfortunately it fails to captivate the reader completely.. It's a biographical novel, and those have a tendency to be overly sentimental. Pamuk decided to side-step this possibility by distancing himself from his writing. He's very objective and descriptive when he tells his story. Almost like an academic text. Literally. The quotations and namedropping echoe an academic book far more than it conforms to the genre of the biography. That distance suggests an objective and truthful story, which really works if you consider this to be the story of Istanbul, instead of Pamuk's story.. At the same time it shows how Pamuk's life is, whether he wants to or not, intertwined with the city of Istanbul -- almost empirically detectable.. Very clever indeed. However, as a novel this doesn't work for me. Because of the distance, the novel never got to me. The first part of the novel, describing his childhood memories, are extremely self-indulgent. And perhaps he whines about his mother a few pages too long. But the descriptive tone of the text seems forced. All emotion is objectified, which feels rather strange considering his earliest memories and rivalries with his brother all draw on emotion. But it gets even more strange when he talks about 'melancholy'. Not once he evokes the feeling of melancholy. He just discribes it, and teaches us the importance of that feeling for the city of Istanbul. One could argue his style and tone is a clever attempt of - almost in absentia - conveying that sense of melancholy. But to me it doesn't work. The mechanics of the text draw far too much attention to how clever it is in trying to convey all sorts of things, it just fails to really tap into any emotion at all.. That last part is perhaps the biggest issue I have with this novel: instead of telling us stories about Istanbul, it teaches us the history of the city. Whether he talks about history, art history or literature, it's all wrapped up as a lesson. That just doesn't speak to me. If I would've wanted to learn about the history and art and culture of Istanbul, I would've read a traveller's guide. I expect more from literature. When I read a book about a city, I expect to be swept away by a good story that immerses me completely. I don't want to read lessons larded with personal indulgences, covered in a pretention of objectivity.. For crying out loud, when he teaches us about the city's poets, that are known for their melancholia, he tells us about escaping in literature. He DESCRIBES losing oneself in literature, while trying to academically justify that feeling.... I am seriously disappointed by this book. Yes it's written beautifully and is very clever. But, I expected a novel, I expected literature. This book tries so hard in being more than ""just a novel"", it falls completely short on all accounts.","Apr 05, 2013"
38093801,Ace Varkey,"This is a very clever book written by a very well read person, which creates memories that are intellectual rather than emotional. I have always enjoyed memoirs for two reasons: I don't have to read in a linear fashion, and can skip around, and secondly, I love learning of that which resides beneath the skin, so to speak. Pamuk writes as if he were a painter of the city and indeed, his first foray into the art world, we read, is that of a painter. He does put himself into the painting of the city Istanbul, but it is always done with such care that it seems contrived.. What I did get from the book is what it means to be rich in a poorish city. Pamuk comes from a privileged rung of society and that, I think, colors his view, even when he walks down the poorest alley ways. I got tired of his use of western writers and thinkers and illustrators to talk about his city. He does explain why he chooses to do that, but the need to explain means that perhaps he should not have used that trope.. I have been to Istanbul and had hoped to learn more about its veins and arteries. Instead I learned more about its head and the head of one of its best writers. I did love all the pictures that make up many of the pages in the book, leftover, I suspect, from Pamuk's painterly days.","Jul 28, 2015"
4954303,Rasha Yousif,"This is an amazing book it's filled with emotions and personal details. Orhan Pamuk writes about his childhood growing up in a bourgeois and historically rich family in a poor society. You can feel the sadness between the pages. This book explains the melancholy aka huzun in Istanbul the past Ottman empire and eastern city being destroyed and westernized the palaces burned down one by one. I learned a lot about Istanbul and It's people demographic. Chapter 35 ""first love"" should be a book on it's own !! Marvelous !!. I now understand why is this Turkish writer holds a noble prize for litrature!","Nov 16, 2011"
5565862,Naveed Qazi,"Even if Pamuk blurs the line between fiction and non-fiction, this book actually reflects the author's love and longing of Istanbul, the city he grew up in. It is yet another example of Turkish nationalist literature, but as non-Turks, there is so much to take away, as learning experiences, from his childhood memories, to his inspirations and tastes. A reader is on a culture and history quest. No writer can define Turkey the way Pamuk can.","Dec 14, 2018"
4044163,Jackson Cyril,"Pamuk won the Nobel in Literature, though no one I know-- including friends who read Turkish fluently-- find his prose beautiful. He's that rare breed, a great author who's a mediocre writer. But in this gently melancholic meditation on Istanbul he meanders through the streets he knows so well, invites us into the coffee shops whose scents he's wafted in all his life and introduces us to that peculiar genus, Homo Istanbullis-- those people doomed forever to bestride East and West and live in the shadow of a great empire long since dead. 100 years from now, this won't be the book Pamuk will be most remembered for, but this remains one of the great memoirs of our time. Highly recommended.","Feb 15, 2018"
2881911,Farhan Khalid,"Fate. Istanbul's fate is my fate. I am attached to this city because it has made me who I am. I have spent my life either battling with this melancholy or making it my own. Why were we born in this particular corner of the world, on this particular date?. These families in which we were born, these countries and cities to which the lottery of life has assigned us. This book is concerned with fate. Writing. When I was twenty-two, I seem to have begun writing novels without knowing why. I'd have liked to write my entire story this way ― as if my life were something that happened to someone else. Second life is none other than the book in your hand. We find a crowd of untouched black-and-white photographs that tell us life is gaining momentum. Every apartment seemed like a different country, a separate universe. Melancholy. The melancholy of this dying culture was all around us. Great as the desire to westernize and modernize may have been. The more desperate wish was probably to be rid of all the bitter memories of the fallen empire. I'd begin to see the whole city in black and white. The streets, the apartments, and even the trees in black and white. I watch dusk descend like a poem in the pale light of the streetlamps to engulf these old neighborhoods. I sometimes forget I am watching a film, stupefied by melancholy. I feel as if I am watching my own past. Life can't be all that bad, I'd think from time to time. Whatever happens, I can always take a walk along the Bosporus. Melling's Istanbul. In Melling's Istanbul landscapes it is almost as if there is no center. Home served as a center for the world in my mind. I amused myself with mental games in which I changed the focus. [Words] They did not convey meaning or even tell a story, they just made sounds. Perhaps I did have talent, but that was not the point. I simply found painting made me happy. That was the important part. I took pleasure in drawing because it allowed me to create instant miracles. After a time, my hand had become as skilled as my eyes. The things I drew, no matter how imaginary the house, the tree, the cloud, had a basis in material reality. If I drew a house, I felt as if it were my house. I felt I owned everything I drew. To explore this world, to live inside the trees and scenes I drew. I find the essence of religion to be guilt. Bosporus. For all its melancholy, the Bosporus is very beautiful, no less than life. The view is so strangely beautiful than it seems unreal. Gautier. Gautier knew how to put views into words, how to convey the feelings evoked by the contours. Gautier also had the sort of eye that could find melancholic beauty amid dirt and disorder. It is difficult to believe there is a living city behind these dead ramparts. We only acquire our own identity by imitating others.

Orhan Pamuk 'Istanbul, memories and the city'. This erudite book manages to be an addictive childhood memoir, a museum-in-prose of a city with West in its head but East in its soul, and a study of the alchemy between place and self. David Mitchell. … a museum-in-prose …. Actually in Istanbul there is a museum in prose namely 'The museum of Innocence' dedicated to Orhan Pamuk.. Personally I read the book when I was walking the street of Istanbul myself, as Orhan Pamuk does so many times. Of course with a very different background and experience. It was my fourth visit to Istanbul and I had seen most of the highlights some of them more them once, and the Süleymaniye mosque even four times, and counting.. Walking and reading 'memories and the city' was by far the best way to get to know Istanbul.. (Why are there no maps and descriptions of Orhan Pamuk's walks through Istanbul?). What struck me in this period of my life most was the chapter 'First love' where the writer tells us about his first great love the seventeen year old 'Black Rose' he does not give us her real name. She poses for the young Orhan, how at that time dreams of becoming a painter not yet a writer. Without knowing anything of his biography nor having read any of his other novels, it sounds to me as if she was the love of his live. The relation ends because her parents think their daughter to young and to good for a would be artist like Orhan, and sent her to Switzerland.. Forty years later the would be artist is a nobelprize winning author, and still remembers ""I wrote her nine letters, seven of which I put into envelopes and five of which I posted. I never received an answer."". I am of the same age as Orhan, but only now feel I meet the love of my life, and it makes me feel as vulnerable, insecure an uncertain as if I am seventeen years old. And is a great feeling, I can tell you. So we walk the same streets (Süleymaniye, Beyazit, Bişiktas), with the same feelings in our heart. It was almost as walking with Orhan and his Black Rose..

31681550,Dave Holmes,"I was recommended this book by the City of Istanbul. I visited Istanbul briefly recently without knowing what to expect. I was stunned by its beauty, history and allure. I came home wanting to know more. I could not have picked a better book than this one. Nobel Laureate Orhan Pamuk's beautiful book, ""Istanbul, Memories and the City"", combines a bracing and poignant memoir of family and childhood with a fascinating, selective but quirky history of Istanbul. Known for his novels that speak to the tensions and opportunities of East meets West stories, that theme pervades this book also. I especially liked the chapters about Nerval, Gautier, and Flaubert's experiences in Istanbul in the 19th century. As a teenager Pamuk decided to paint and by the end of the book he has dropped out of college to ""become an artist"". In the last chapter his mother lectures him about need to finish school and become an architect and the misery he will endure as an artist. He leaves the apartment angrily to walk the city's streets at night as he often does. In the last line of the book he decides not to become an artist but to become a writer! Can anyone relate? Beautifully illustrated with black and white photographs and drawings and with a wonderfully produced Audiobook narrated by John Lee (which I listened to as I read the Kindlebook). Read/listen to this book and go to Istanbul to see for yourself. I know I plan to return.","Jun 14, 2014"
2507949,David,"This is the best book I've read about Istanbul, a city I have visited many times and always find something new in. For photographers it cannot be bettered, and the photos are on every page. Pamuk weaves the city into his personal history, his family descended from the upper echelons of Ottoman society. Although I find him somewhat spoilt, his interpretation of why this great city is so different from all others is plausible, and the usual guide books are left standing. I've always since my first visit felt the sadness he describes pervading every aspect of life here, the ever-present imperial past casting a shadow over everyone's life in the shape of Ottoman and Byzantine reminders of former days on every street. The past cannot be escaped in this city. Nor should it be. London has its past too, but it is not so all-pervasive. Of course one must move on, but the past is a part of one's identity as much as the roots are a part of the oak tree's identity, hidden but essential, feeding the branches and leaves and necessary for their survival in the sun, though preferably forgotten in their underground existence. Everything in a city or in a man is a necessary part of the holistic whole. Perhaps the enduring roots are more necessary than the transient leaves.","Sep 29, 2009"
4770664,Tasneemali,"it's a memoir that transcends in philosophy, love and beauty anything else has been published !. Orhan is a brilliant writer filled with ecstasy and melancholy .... liberty and conservativeness and all these conflicts that make this piece of art more profound , philosophical and colourful !and the photographs within the book made the image of his culture and life more alive and picturesque <3. His love of his city moved me so much and made me yearn even more to visit Turkey and to behold this sweet melancholy he describes drenched all over the streets !. Throughout chapters I felt trapped and joyous and when I came to the last paragraph which concludes him becoming a writer and pursuing his ambition ,I was more warmed by the furious flame of his vision and his complicatd yet unique way of thinking that led him after all to be this wellknown novleist and to gain the Noble prize in 2006 ..

I can't explain to you how much this affects me emotionally. The past week has just been yearning that freedom of being born anew, in a strange land, amongst strangers. And yet embracing that sense of not belonging to conjure spontaneous memories, emotions and attachment to the city. I can't put my finger on it: was it the thrill of late night adventures with gay abandon, was it stepping into a Turkish friend's life and and being smothered by his two adorable cats all night, was it wandering through narrow streets to the din of Turkish-dubbed Indian soap operas and the Sunday thrill of cafés chock-a-block with football fans? I don't know. All I do know is I feel deep melancholy: for what was never mine and what can never be mine.","Jan 05, 2019"

It is largely autobiographical and recounts his growing up in this great City. He is at his best for me when it becomes a memoir of his early life - a portrait of the artist as a young man. It is not quite so good when talking of other Istanbul authors of the 19th & 20th century. The chapter on his 'first love' is moving and beautiful and can almost stand alone.

The author talks a lot about melancholy of the inhabitants of Istanbul and the city itself.

21089028,Sanchari Chaudhuri,"This is a half baked review.. This is my first Pamuk book. That is to say, I did not go into this because of him (but I would now, with my whole heart, go into the rest of his books because of him). I started reading this because Hagia Sophia was in news recently, and on reading a little about it, and Istanbul and Turkey in general, I found myself drawing parallels between Istanbul and my city, Kolkata.. This book is a lot of things - but mostly, for me - this is a love letter. A letter to the city, but also one to yourself. You and the city which you love, but you also hate -. You tell yourself: I'll be gone. To some other land, some other sea,. To a city lovelier far than this. Could ever have been or hoped to be-. Where every step now tightens the noose:. A heart in a body buried and out of use:. How long, how long must I be here. Confined among these dreary purlieus. Of the common mind? Wherever now I look. Black ruins of my life rise into view.. So many years have I been here. Spending and squandering, and nothing gained.. There's no new land, my friend, no. New sea; for the city will follow you,. In the same streets you'll wander endlessly,. The same mental suburbs slip from youth to age,. In the same house go white at last-. The city is a cage.. No other places, always this. Your earthly landfall, and no ship exists. To take you from yourself. Ah! don't you see. Just as you've ruined your life in this. One plot of ground you've ruined its worth. Everywhere now-over the whole earth?. This was Lawrence Durrell's loose translation of a poem by Cavafy (Cavafy, who also finds a tiny mention in this the book) - a poem I kept thinking about throughout the book.. Some of my favorite chapters are the ones on ""Huzun"" - a feeling or a state of mind that is at once personal but also universal for Pamuk, a word whose Bengali counterpart I continue to search for; then the one on Gautier - a Frenchman who chose to embrace the shoddy backalleys of Istanbul which most would choose to reject; the mysteriously wonderful chapter on First Love - where Pamuk and his love go for walks in the city and he shows her the streets he'd walked by himself and loved (and really, what can be more 'lovely' than that?); and finally, the chapter that concludes the book - his conversation with his mother, with himself, and with his city. It is here that Pamuk discovers in himself the urge to write - the need to put the melancholy he feels for the city in words.. But my reading of this is also about Calcutta and I (like Sunil Gangopadhyay's poem) and what I feel for my city. Both the cities used to be country capitals. Both of them have multilayered identities. Both have had a past where the urge to mirror the West ran viciously in the veins of the upper class (though differently for Calcutta, actually being a part of the British colony). Both of them - as said by Pamuk's mother for Istanbul and by countless people around me for Calcutta - are the land of no opportunities. In the past few years, I saw people around me fleeing from here at the first opportunity they got, abandoning this sinking ship en masse, much like I assume what they did Istanbul, at that time.. Pamuk stays behind, however, for Istanbul has become both the city of his heart and he himself. It happens so when you embrace the city for what it is, for what it lacks, for what it gives and also what it takes, because - as I once read: ""You like because, you love despite"".. Photographs accompanying Pamuk's words are mostly by Ara Guler - the Eye of Istanbul (the eye who looks into it or the eye that looks back at you?) I look forward to reading and learning more about him. It is here, in these black and white photographs, where the words 'heartbreakingly beautiful' make perfect sense. This is the everyday ordinary - the cobblestone streets, the silhouettes of the city's buildings, the cracks in their walls, the people living in and around them, but mostly, the Huzun of everyday living.. To then draw our gaze inwards - from the city to your own self - this book is perhaps a gentle embrace to oneself that can only be offered in hindsight. Accepting your own cracks in the walls and darkened alleyways and seeing the course of your life for what it is: a monument that becomes ""picturesque"" (Pamuk talks about John Ruskin's use of this word in Chap. 27) only when it has stood for years and has been embraced lovingly by time and ruin.. A singularly beautiful book, to be read again.","Sep 11, 2020"
16294266,Madhulika Liddle,"It’s hard to categorize Orhan Pamuk’s. Istanbul. . Memoir, yes. History, yes. Some geography. Introspection. A lot of introspection.. The book starts off with Pamuk’s memories of his childhood, of growing up in a wealthy and privileged family, even if they weren’t an extremely. happy. family, what with the frequent arguments between his parents, his father’s infidelity and his inability to hang on to the family’ wealth, which slowly dribbled away. This section is dominated by often sweet, sometimes very familiar, memories of what it means to be a child: the games of childhood, early years in school, memories of being left with an indulgent and doting grandmother as babysitter.. The author’s own memories grow fewer over the course of the book, their place being taken by more of an insight into Istanbul. Not the tourist attractions (though some do find mention here and there), but the essence of the city itself. The Bosphorus, with its ships and smaller vessels. The old wooden houses, once the homes of the important and wealthy of the Ottoman Empire days, now catching fire and going up in smoke. The ruins of the city; the huzun—the ‘collective melancholy’—that grips Istanbullus and is so marked a feature of every inhabitant of the city, and of the city itself; the constant grappling between East and West, modernization and tradition, rich and poor.. Pamuk uses other chroniclers to show us the city that was once almost legendary. He quotes from the writings of European travellers like Flaubert and Gautier; he shows Istanbul through the eyes of Melling who painted views of the city; he talks extensively of four Istanbullus, all writers and poets and memoirists to some extent, who focussed their writing on Istanbul. He quotes from newspapers, from ads, from gossip columns, from just about every conceivable source, to show us a city of amazing complexity, of layers of history, of conflict of different types.. Interwoven into that are Pamuk’s own conflicts. His never-ending fights with the brother who was, paradoxically enough (and how true this is of life!) also the one person he was nearest to. His first love. His discovery of painting as a means of catharsis, his pursuit of architecture because that was what everybody around wanted him to do, even if he himself realized soon enough that his heart wasn’t in it…. Besides the fact that. Istanbul. is a very fine insight into the city, its spirit, its ethos—it is, too, a glimpse of life in the city in the 50s and 60s. And of Pamuk himself, his views on his home town, his views on his own life and all that influenced it.. Lastly, as someone who also belongs to a historic city which has been a meeting place for various civilizations (Delhi, where I’ve lived most of my life), I found that a lot of. Istanbul. resonated with me. The long, long history. The contacts with different civilizations. The fact that some of the most informative and interesting chronicles of the city’s past are to be found among those written by foreign visitors. The constant tussle between old and new, modern and traditional, East and West.. A very insightful, informative and thought-provoking book, and one which made me decide I. had to. visit Istanbul sooner rather than later.. And, yes: the photographs. Brilliant black-and-white photographs accompany the text and bring the Istanbul of half a century ago alive: the cobblestoned streets, the tottering wooden houses, the raging fires, the packs of dogs, the smoke-spewing ferries. Pamuk and his family.. The photos are a treat in themselves.","Sep 28, 2018"
8357840,Joy Stocke,"Paying attention to beauty in all its forms, but especially its melancholic form comes naturally to Orhan Pamuk, who tells us in his new memoir, Istanbul, Memories and the City, that before becoming a writer he had planned to become a painter.. By the time he reveals that fact he has used his painterly eye and gift for language to draw us into a world where life with his charming, philandering father, his beautiful, sad mother, and his older brother echoes and reflects the complicated, melancholy city of Istanbul itself. Readers of Pamuk’s first novel, The Black Book, will recognize Pamuk’s home, the Pamuk Apartments, in the upscale neighborhood of Nisantasi on the European side of the Bosphorus, where he grew up surrounded by an extended family.. As the title of his memoir suggests, Pamuk’s portrait of Istanbul remains intimately connected to his family and their bourgeois middle class life. From there it spills out along the shores of the Bosphorus where the family summered, and finally into every nook and cranny of the great and sprawling city.. “Here we come to the heart of the matter,” Pamuk writes. “I have never left Istanbul, never left the houses, streets, and neighborhoods of my childhood. My imagination requires that I stay in the same city, on the same street, in the same house, gazing on the same view. Istanbul’s fate is my fate. I am attached to this city because it made me who I am.”. And so a double journey begins, one through the labyrinth of Pamuk’s mind and another through the labyrinthine streets of Istanbul. Following in the footsteps of Western writers he admires and to whom his work has been compared — Marcel Proust, Jorge Luis Borges, and Italo Calvino — Pamuk succeeds in reshaping Istanbul to match his vision, a vision shaped as much by his Western education as his Turkish roots. He rides in a fancy western car with his friends to the shores of the Bosphorus to watch a lovely wooden yali, or Ottoman seaside home, burn to the ground, thrilled by the awful spectacle. Or he wanders past ornate palaces that once housed Pashas, who in the latter days of the Ottoman Empire tried to westernize their dress and surroundings.. “Great as the desire to westernize and modernize may have been,” writes Pamuk, the more desperate wish was probably to be rid of all the bitter memories of the fallen empire, rather as a spurned lover throws away his lost beloved’s clothes, possessions, and photographs. But as nothing, western or local, came to fill the void, the great drive to westernize amounted mostly to the erasure of the past; the effect of culture was reductive and stunting, leading families like mine, otherwise glad of republican progress, to furnish their houses like museums.”. In many ways Pamuk’s Istanbul has become a museum whose caretakers no longer find value in their treasures, readily tearing down whole neighborhoods. But Pamuk is not willing to let go of the past, setting a grand stage for his memories by walking through the neighborhoods winding his way down alleys that lead to disintegrating cemeteries; or as a young boy flirting with the spirituality missing in his staunchly secularist family’s life when he visits a mosque with the maid. A quarter of the way into his narrative, he reveals his thesis: Istanbul can be best summed up by the complicated word huzun, translated into English to mean melancholy.. “To feel this huzun,” writes Pamuk, “is to see scenes, evoke memories in which the city itself becomes the very illustration. I am speaking of the evenings when the sun sets early, of the fathers under the streetlamps in the back streets returning home carrying plastic bags. Of the old Bosphorus ferries moored to deserted stations in the middle of winter, where sleepy sailors scrub the decks; of the empty boathouses of old Bosphorus villas; of the teahouses packed to the rafters with unemployed men; of the patient pimps striding up and down the city’s greatest square on summer evenings in search of one last drunken tourist; of crowds rushing to catch ferries on winter evenings; of the old men selling thin religious treatises, prayer beads, and pilgrimage oils in the courtyards of mosques; of the tens of thousands of identical apartment house entrances.”. Pamuk has cleverly structured his history of the city to fit within his formative years, taking us from his earliest memories at age 3 to age 20 when he is on the threshold of becoming a writer. He poignantly shows us the pain of first love and how, when it is ending, he and his girlfriend spend afternoons in the Museum of Painting and Sculpture on the grounds of the Dolmabahçe Palace where they are mesmerized by a painting by the artist Halil Pasha called The Reclining Woman.. In a scene that recalls the drama of a Persian love story, his girlfriend, whom he calls The Black Rose, informs him that her father has forbidden her to see him because as she says, “You’ll become a poor drunken painter, and I’ll be your nude model.” When she is shipped off to a Swiss boarding school, Pamuk reads her final letter in a pudding shop while smoking a cigarette.. Back and forth the memoir goes, examining bits of history, stopping for a moment on the destruction of the Greek quarter in the l950s and avoiding almost completely the student unrest in the late 70s before a coup in l980 put the country in the hands of its military. Pamuk’s aim is not to write a political memoir, and as he says, he was shielded in his bourgeois world from the strife so many young people endured.. Author Maureen Freely has created a superb and beautifully delicate translation. She too grew up in Istanbul, daughter of the writer John Freely. Steeped in the grandeur of the city, she has artfully captured the huzun that Pamuk uses as the leitmotif of his memoir.. Here is a review I wrote for online magazine Wild River Review,. www.wildriverreview.com. In many ways, Pamuk has become a controversial figure, a lightning rod for Turkey’s collective consciousness. “My sense of the melancholy of the city is a melancholy due to the loss of the Ottoman Empire,” he says. Its multiple and rich culture, and its wonderful, colorful history. The younger generation says to me, ‘Oh Orhan, our sense of the city is not that black and white. For us this is a city of blue, sun, and summer. We’ve come from other parts of Turkey to enjoy the city and we are enjoying it. Why did you write this sad book?’”. In Pamuk’s answer lies a challenge. “The fact is, the Ottoman Empire declined,” he says. “And a city, which in 1852 Flaubert predicted would be the cultural capitol of the world, disintegrated into a poor, provincial decaying town. My book is about these things.. “I have seen so many young writers coming to terms with the stories of the Ottoman past,” he adds. “They are fortunate because the art of the novel and of the memoir have become international forms. I would like to write my memoir as a trilogy of my life in Istanbul and in the next book my hope is to show how I made myself a novelist in Turkey, my problems with the art of the novel, and then the success and my reaction to all of this. I hope to show young writers that the form has opened up for them and their vision of Istanbul as well.”. Near the end of his memoir Pamuk records a journey he took on a ferry up the Bosphorus to the Golden Horn. “Here amid the old stones and the old wooden houses,” he writes, “history made peace with its ruins; ruins nourished life and gave new life to history.”. In Istanbul, Memories and the City, its pages filled with illustrations and photographs, some from Pamuk’s personal collection, and many photographs by renowned photographer Ara Guler, Pamuk has invited us to see Istanbul through his eyes, one we might even recognize, refracted in the prism of huzun.","Jul 27, 2012"

If I gain the energy within the time it takes for my desire to continue it to dwindle, I will by all means pick it right back up. The only reason I picked it up in the first place out of so many literary arts on my WH teacher’s shelves is because the word ‘Istanbul’ caught my eye and I had a moment mixed with ‘awwww’ and so many memories flooding back.

426277,James,"Orhan Pamuk begins his memoir,. Istanbul: Memories and the City. , with a meditation on his doppelganger, the other Orhan in his life when he was a young boy. This is both an indication of the budding artist within and a metaphor for the city without, the city in which he was to grow up and live. Capturing a sense of the Istanbul of memory and tradition and juxtaposing it with the Istanbul as seen by outsiders, especially the literary lights that visited Istanbul over the years, Pamuk creates a rich texture for his story of the memories and city. Augmented by literally hundreds of photographs of city, family and history this is a unique look at one of the great centers of civilization.. The memoir is colored by melancholy, a word rooted in the Greek melankholia referring to pensive reflection marked by a dark or sad outlook. The Turkish word for melancholy is huzun and it has an Arabic root with a much more nuanced meaning that spans thoughts of both material pleasure and spirtual loss. According to Pamuk:. ""The huzun of Istanbul is not just the mood evoked by its music and its poetry, it is a way of looking at life that implicates us all, not only a spiritual state but a state of mind that is ultimately as life-affirming as it is negating."" (p 91). It is this feeling that Pamuk tries to capture in his discussions and digressions on his own experience of Istanbul and that of the others, often from the West, who have observed its life. So we encounter comments and thoughts from writers as diverse as Levi-Strauss, Ruskin, Flaubert, Gide and Gerard de Nerval. But there are also the insights of local writers like the novelist Tanpinar who, influenced by the French poet Theophile Gautier, wrote in a poetic and painterly mode of the vistas of Istanbul and extolled ""the painterly style of writers like Stendahl, Balzac, and Zola"" (p 227).. While Pamuk discusses the view of Istanbul ""Under Western Eyes"" (pp 234-44) he also finds the source of this melancholy in the ruins of the old city as seen both in his personal experience and through his reading of Tanpinar and others. He also meditates on the impact and meaning of the Bosporus to himself and his family. The city becomes a dream to which its denizens could aspire. ""We might call this dream -- which grew out of the barren, isolated, destitute neighborhoods beyon the city walls -- the 'melancholy of the ruins'"" (p 253). The sum of all these thoughts and more is a brilliant and evocative image of the Istanbul that encourages the reader to read more and the traveller to visit and see for himself. This reader found in this memoir everything that he had come to expect from Pamuk's fiction melded with a passion for family, literature and city. It has become another favorite of mine from the pen of this great writer.","Jan 15, 2009"
31264299,Stephanie Jane (Literary Flits),"Istanbul: Memories Of A City wasn't how I expected it to be and I did find myself drifting away from the book at times, although being completely engrossed in other sections. Pamuk jumps from childhood memories to his thoughts on writings by mostly Western authors, to famous Istanbul characters, to the drift of the city over the past couple of centuries from the heights of the Ottoman Empire to relative global obscurity and creeping Westernisation. John Lee is a competent narrator with a good grasp of the various Turkish names.. I was surprised at Pamuk's assertions of so much post-Ottoman Istanbul history and life being only written about by Western tourists thereby leaving the city without its own voice. The crushing of minority groups within the traditional multicultural population as the nationalist Republic gained its feet however was depressingly familiar. Pamuk talks a lot about depression, melancholy and the wonderful Turkish word 'huzun' which describes a kind of national melancholy apparently felt across Istanbul as a result of continuously living in the ruins of the former great Empire. It sounds a beautifully romantic concept and I would have loved to have visited Istanbul at the time of the great French writers such as Andre Gide, when evidence of this epic and exotic history was still widespread. I wonder how much does remain now and how much has been irretrievably Westernised and globalised in the names of progress and profit.. I thought the anecdotes from Pamuk's childhood provided the most evocative moments of this book and I enjoyed picturing this 1950s and 1960s Istanbul. The importance of the Bosphorus river is clearly illustrated with Pamuk's artist eye picking out obscure details for his readers. At the time of writing, he had lived there for fifty years but also widely read authors who only visited so manages to see and portray Istanbul as both native and outsider providing a unique viewpoint..

21410009,Allie,"I really wish I had enjoyed this more. It's a series of essays, some autobiographical, about the city of Istanbul, its culture, and the author's life there. The autobiographical essays were my favorite part. They were mostly well-written and interesting, and I enjoyed the perspective on the city. These chapters made me want to go visit Istanbul, rent a. yali. on the Bosphorus and count the boats.. There were also quite a few essays on the author's favorite Istanbul writers. Some of these were interesting, and some of them I ended up skimming or skipping altogether, because I don't know these writers, haven't read their work, and I wasn't personally getting anything out of an analysis of their work. I found myself getting bored. Same with some of the chapters about various Turkish artists.. So let's go back to the ""Memories"" part of the title. Even though I enjoyed them overall, they alone would not have made this a five-star book for me. The last chapter, in which the author has an extended (repetitive, dull) argument with his mother about why it would be a terrible idea for him to become an artist is what finally drove this three-star review into two-star territory. What drove it from a four-star to a three-star book for me was the frequent references to the author's teenage masturbatory practices. (Why do so many men think this is important information to include in their autobiographical work? It's not unique, it's not interesting, and it was completely unnecessary to mention it in like, six different chapters. WE GET IT.). I enjoyed the descriptions of the melancholy of the city and the pictures scattered throughout. Ultimately, I think you could probably read the first half the book and put it down and not miss anything, and that's very disappointing considering how many good ratings this book got on the first page of Goodreads.","Dec 03, 2016"
27137653,Negar Ghadimi,"I thought of men as part of some lower and more vulgar race and was thankful most of them belonged to the streets outside.. -------------------. Whenever I find myself talking of the beauty and the poetry of the Bosphorus and Istanbul's dark streets, a voice inside me warns against exaggeration, a tendency perhaps motivated by a wish not to acknowledge the lack of beauty in my own life. If I see my city as beautiful and bewitching, then my life must be so too.. -------------------. It is huzun which ordains that no love will end peacefully. Just as in the old black and white films- even in the most affecting and authentic love stories- if the setting is Istanbul, it is clear from the start that the huzun the boy has carried with him since birth will lead the story into melodrama.. -------------------. The first thing I learned at school was that some people are idiots; the second thing I learned was that some are even worse.. -------------------. Because it was imprudent to criticize the sultan, the state, the police, the military, the religious leaders, or even the more powerful councillors, the literary elite had only one possible target for their scorn, and that was the helpless, faceless crowds, the people who went about the streets minding their own business and struggling to make ends meet.. -------------------. Until I was ten, I had a very clear image of God; ravaged with age and draped in white scarves, God had the featureless guise of a highly respectable woman... I don't remember ever asking for her help or guidance. I was only too aware that she was not interested in people like me: She cared only for the poor.","Dec 09, 2016"

I don't know how this fad of posting pictures of someone's childhood or a recent past on Thursdays on social media came about, but it sure is a nice way to look back at the past and reflect.. Nostalgia and Melancholia. These are the two words I can think of to describe this book.. Orhan Pamuk's take on his home city is a fascinating tour of one of the oldest cities in the world; sometimes funny, sometimes annoying, often sad, always reminiscing.

I think ultimately our interests and priorities don't overlap enough to generate much enthusiasm on my side, and unlike say, Marilynne Robinson, the writing alone isn't mesmerizing enough to keep me going.. Which is to say that despite heading off to Istanbul for the first time, and looking to Mr. Pamuk for some inspiration, I put the book down after about 80 pages.

27482323,Omar Taufik,"This marvelous book was a masterpiece !. I loved it and have fallen in love with Istanbul even more after reading this book ... It is an autobiography of our great author and of our beloved Istanbul ... The reader will find all sorts of interesting subjects in the book covering Ottoman history, Istanbul history, special attention to the Bosphorus, the various displayed beauty of Istanbul along with impoverished backstreets unknown to many a lot, the matter of identity between the exotic East and modern West, melancholy nearly in every chapter, religion and in a very daring attempt by the author, family issues where the author actually described his own family personal issues, love where the author again and in daring style explores his own first love experience, many explorations of life and it's meaning and journey,passions and careers where after a struggle between painting and architecture finally ends up with the passion of writing which allowed us to have such a gifted author as Orhan Pamuk .. and many more !. I would like to share below some of the quotes I managed to note down while reading this great book :. Conrad, Nabokov, Naipaul - these are writers known for having managed to migrate between languages, cultures, countries, continents, even civilizations. Their imaginations were fed by exile, a nourishment drawn not through roots, but through rootlessness; mine, however, requires that I stay in the same city, on the same street, in the same house, gazing at the same view. Istanbul's fate is my fate: I am attached to this city because it has made me who I am.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.6. After the Ottoman Empire collapsed, the world almost forgot that Istanbul existed. The city into which I was born was poorer, shabbier, and more isolated than it had ever been it's two thousand year history. For me it has always been a city of ruins and an end of empire melancholy. I've spent my life either battling with this melancholy, or ( like all Istanbullus ) making it my own.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.6. Sitting rooms were not meant to be places where you could hope to sit comfortably ; they were little museums designed to demonstrate to a hypothetical visitor that the householders were westernized.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.10. Although everyone knew it as freedom from the laws of Islam, no one was quite sure what else Westernization was good for.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.10. If you plucked a special moment from life and framed it, were you defying death, decay and the passage of time, or were you submitting to them?. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.13. Still, the melancholy of this dying culture was all around us. Great as the desire to westernize and modernize may have been, the more desperate wish, it seemed, was to be rid of all the bitter memories of the fallen empire: rather as a spurned lover throws away his lost beloved's clothes, possessions and photographs.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.27. Even the greatest Ottoman architecture has a humble simplicity that suggests an end of empire melancholy, a pained submission to the diminishing European gaze and to an ancient poverty that must be endured like incurable disease; it is resignation that nourishes Istanbul's inward looking soul.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.38. If the city speaks of defeat, destruction, deprivation, melancholy and poverty, the Bosphorus sings of life, pleasure and happiness. Istanbul draws it's strength from the Bosphorus.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.43. To travel along the Bosphorus, be it in a ferry, a motor launch or a rowing boat, is to see the city house by house, neighborhood by neighborhood, and also from afar, as a silhouette, an ever mutating mirage.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.46. In the later years, when I would see other noisy, unhappy, quarrelsome families in other cars on the Bosphorus road, out on the same Sunday excursions, what impressed me most was not the communalities between my life and other's but the fact that for many Istanbul families, the Bosphorus was their only solace.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.53. Life can't be all that bad, I'd think from time to time. Whatever happens, I can always take a walk along the Bosphorus.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.54. The world I created through drawing, like the second world I hid in my head, enriched my life; even better, it gave me a legitimate escape from the dusty, shadowy world of every day life: not only did my family accept this new habit of mine, they accepted my right to it.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.136. I felt as uneasy as anyone in the family about the devotion of deeply religious people. My fear, which I shared with everyone in the Turkish secular bourgeoisie, was not of God, but of the fury of those who believed in Her too much.. Like everyone else in my prudent family, I learned that it was always wise, if you'd just derided religion or expressed your lack of interest in it, to change the subject right away; we equated piety with poverty but never in too loud a voice.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.162. In the secular fury of Atatürk's new republic, to move away from religion was to be modern and Western; it was a smugness in which there flickered from time to time the flame of idealism. But that was in public; in private life, nothing came to fill the spiritual void. Cleansed of religion, home became as empty as the city's ruined yalıs and as gloomy as the fern darkened gardens surrounding them.. So in our house, it was left to the maids to fill in the void.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.163. As I wandered amongst them during prayers, running off to the far corners of the mosque to play my games, none of them stopped to scold me; instead they smiled at me in the same sweet way most adults smiled at me when I was a young child. Religion may have been the province of the poor, but now I saw that - contrary to the caricatures in newspapers and my Republican household - religious people were harmless.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.165. In our household doubts more troubling than these were suffered in silence. The spiritual void I have seen in so many of Istanbul's rich, westernized, secularist families is evident in these silences. Everyone talks openly about mathematics, success at school, football and having fun, but they grapple with the most basic questions of existence - love, compassion, religion, the meaning of life, jealousy, hatred - in trembling confusion and painful solitude.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.168. But to discover the city's soul in it's ruins, to see these ruins as expressing the city's essence, you must travel down a long, labyrinthine path strewn with historical accidents.. To savour Istanbul's back streets, to appreciate the vines and trees that endow it's ruins with accidental grace, you must, first and foremost, be a stranger to them.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.231. For people like me, Istanbullus with one foot in this culture and one in the other, the Western traveller is often not a real person - he can be my own creation, my fantasy, even my own reflection. But being unable to depend on tradition alone as my text, I am grateful to the outsider who can offer me a complementary version - wether a piece of writing, a painting, a film. So whenever I sense the absence of Western eyes, I become my own Westerner.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.260. But what is important for a painter is not a thing's reality but it's shape, and what is important for a novelist is not the course of events but their ordering, and what is important for a memoirist is not the factual accuracy of the account but it's symmetry.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.265. With time, life - like music, art and stories - would rise and fall, eventually to end, but even years later, those lives are with us still in the city views that flow before our eyes, like memories plucked from dreams.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.285. To escape this hybrid, lettered hell, I conjure up a golden age, a pure and shining moment when the city ' was at peace with itself ', when it was a ' beautiful whole '. The Istanbul of Melling, of Western travellers like Nerval, Gautier and de Amicis.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.288. Between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, part of me longed, like a radical Westernizer, for the city to become entirely Western. I held the same hope for my self; but another part of me yearned to belong to the Istanbul I had grown to love by instinct, by habit and by memory.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.291. Why should we expect a city to cure us of our spiritual pains ? Perhaps because we cannot help loving our city like a family. But we still have to decide which part of the city we love and invent the reasons.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.317. I was slowly coming to understand that I loved Istanbul for it's ruins, for it's hüzün, for the glories once possessed and later lost. And so, to cheer myself up, I left Eyüp to wander around other neighborhoods in search of ruins.. Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul, p.320","Sep 14, 2016"
2092969,Miriam,"The longer I read this, the more I liked it. It's so relatable and unique at the same time.. He blends his individual and family history so well with the history of the city. The photographs and reproductions really add to his work as well.. I recognized a lot of this from living in Salvador and working on it. The literati's obsession with its city's reputation at home and abroad. Their desire to capture foreign attention but also to rise above it or reject it or move it to the side and say something else. The engagement with European literary traditions while trying to create a unique voice or identity for a city that is profoundly NOT ""just"" European or European at all. His point is well taken that Istanbul, as never a colony of the West, has a different but still no less ambivalent relationship to European culture.. He is also an excellent narrator. He pokes fun at himself. He has his big, think-y thoughts but also recognizes his privileged position in the city that allows him to have room for big, think-y thoughts. And he acknowledges that poverty is not picturesque for people living in it, and that he and many others would do well to remember it. Occasionally I have found memoirists to be pompous and didactic and difficult to feel for, but he achieves a nice mix of admiration, exasperation, and acceptance of his city.. Here are some quotations I liked (you can tell I must have liked it, because I rarely resort to quotations) (oh, and I thought the translation was pretty good, too):. ""In Turkish we have a special tense that allows us to distinguish hearsay from what we've seen with our own eyes; when we are relating dreams, fairy tales, or past events we could not have witnessed, we use this tense. It is a useful distinction to make as we 'remember' our earliest life experiences, our cradles, our baby carriages, our first steps, all as reported by our parents, stories to which we listen with the same rapt attention we might pay some brilliant tale of some other person. It's a sensation as sweet as seeing ourselves in our dreams, but we pay a heavy price for it. Once imprinted in our minds, other people's reports of what we've done end up mattering more than what we ourselves remember. And just as we learn about our lives from others, so too do we let others shape our understanding of the city in which we live."" (8). ""[T]hese are the words of a fifty-year-old writer who is trying to shape the chaotic thoughts of a long-ago adolescent into an amusing story."" (322). I'm keeping this one. It is to be savored again some time.","Sep 27, 2018"
26398034,Vera,"This is not a history book about Istanbul (so Norman Davies criticism is totally out of place), but the memoires of author Orhan Pamuk, who was born and raised and has always lived there - he seems to feel his soul is intertwined with this city, that has changed so much during the course of his life. But some things have remained, and the most prominent is the melancholy, hüzün, that is sensible in every street.. Hüzün is probably the central theme of the novel, and as Pamuk was in a state of depression during the writing process, the book expresses a sense of melancholy itself.. The other thing that's prominent in the book is the Bosphorus, the strait splits the European and Asian parts of Turkey. In the same way these continents are so different from each other, Istanbul seems to be struggling with modernity vs history, west vs east, cosmopolitsm vs nationalism.. I enjoyed reading this a lot, even more because I hd the honour of attending a lecture by Pamuk a couple of years ago.","Apr 18, 2020"
18715932,Unnati Bose,"At first, I felt confused from Pamuk's detailed narrations. I felt as if I didn't know where he was going with it. As I grew used to him, I took to his unraveling of memories in intricate and knotty ways.. For me, this book was beyond Pamuk's and Istanbul's melancholy (huzun). I especially took to his reflections on his own pretension when he questions the authenticity of his own (or may be all) art, how he embraces the duality of his relationship with his brother, how he knows he is falling in love from the pit in his stomach, and the very-very complex relationships between the West, Westerners, Westernisation, Istanbul, and the Istanbullus..

4708829,Carole,"An exquisite rendering of the life and atmosphere of Istanbul by native Pamuk growing up in the city in the last half of the twentieth century. It is lushly illustrated by evocative photos from the period, which amplify the moody ambiance that Pamuk depicts. He echoes the melancholy of the city wallowing in the decline and decay from former Ottoman greatness with his own moody development into early adulthood. He repeatedly describes the distinctive grand wooden houses that typified the Ottoman period, which are being burned and torn down on a regular basis during his childhood, replaced by faceless cement structures. I was completely absorbed by this fine memoir, which is the most accessible of the works I have read so far by this Nobel laureate.","Jul 28, 2019"

62744148,Strivetoengage,"I am completely unqualified to write a review of anything written by Nobel Prize in Literature winner Orhan Pamuk so rather than call this a review of Istanbul: Memories of a City I’ve called it my musings on the book. I didn’t expect an easy book to read (having struggled through My Name is Red) and Pamuk’s memoirs didn’t disappoint me in that respect. I had just read The Oracle of Stamboul (you can read my review here) when I saw Pamuk’s Istanbul for sale at a 2nd hand book fair and figured that I should read it to stay in the theme. I haven’t yet been to Turkey (Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain are the closest I’ve been so far) and I am curious about how a great empire like the Ottoman Empire could come to an end and how a country like Turkey could abandon the Ottoman clothing, the Arabic alphabet, the harems, the Janissaries, the Rufai dervishes etc that so entranced westerners such as Hans Christian Anderson and Flaubert. Pamuk gives an excellent discussion of the currents that led to the ‘westernisation’ of Turkey and the mixed feelings of the people from the loss of the greatness of the empire, the dilution of the culture, the feeling that it’s either not western enough or too western (depending on the viewpoint of the Istanbullu) and the effects of the rapid changes to the once beautiful Istanbul with the enormous increases in population. Pamuk laments the lack of literary tradition in Turkey and this helps me to understand why My Name is Red is so intricate a book, I suspect that Pamuk did very careful research to create a historical novel that is true to the times and in some ways makes up for the lack of novels written at the time.. The excellent use of historical photographs, depicting decrepit mansions, poor neighbourhoods, crumbling city walls etc, throughout the book adds to the gloomy atmosphere that Pamuk loves to evoke when he talks about liking the city most in winter when everything is in shades of grey.. ""I love the overwhelming melancholy when I look at the walls of old apartment buildings and the dark surfaces of neglected, unpainted, fallen-down wooden mansions: only in Istanbul have I seen this texture, this shading."". Pamuk’s writing style being what it is, I repeatedly found myself wondering why I was reading this book. The monotony of his early life in his family’s apartment building was numbing and was almost enough to make me stop reading. A central theme to the book is melancholy (huzun in Turkish) and it seems that Pamuk experiences a great deal of huzun. The opening section on huzun was interesting on an intellectual level and I liked the references to Montaigne and others.. Once Pamuk goes to school, I began to enjoy the writing and chuckled at his reminiscences. The part of the book that I found most amusing was the section where Pamuk had dug through decades of Instabul newspapers to give examples of the rules and commentaries on everyday life being made by newspaper writers, e.g.:. ""When you see a beautiful woman in the street, don’t look at her hatefully as if you’re about to kill her and don’t exhibit excessive longing either, just give her a little smile, avert your eyes and walk on (from a newspaper in 1974).. Taking our inspiration from an article on the proper way to walk in a city that appeared recently in the celebrated Parisian magazine, Matin, we, too, should make our feelings clear to people who have yet to learn how to conduct themselves on the streets of Istanbul and tell them: Don’t walk down the street with your mouth open (from a newspaper in 1924)."". This book is not a travel guide, it is a love poem to Pamuk’s native city and in particular the Bosphorous. Pamuk is startlingly frank about several aspects of his childhood and personality including:. mentioning that the only way he could cheer himself up when beset by disappointment or melancholy was to masturbate;. ""If something got in the way of this …, if I did not quite lose myself in my painting… I’d be overcome by an urge to masturbate"". talking about his father’s many affairs;. admitting that he enjoys shipping disasters and fires:. ""Because these disasters suspend the rules of everyday life, and because, in the end, they spare ‘people like us’, I secretly (if also guiltily) enjoy them"". talking about his strange daydreams:. ""Until the age of forty-five, it was my habit, whenever I was drifting in that sweet cloud between sleep and wakefulness, to cheer myself by imagining I was killing people."". ""One afternoon… when I was doing my military service, watching an entire company linger in the canteen after lunch for a chat and a smoke, I surveyed these 750 almost identical soldiers and imagined that their heads separated from their bodies: as I contemplated their bloody oesophagi through the cigarette smoke that bathed the cavernous canteen in a sweet, transparent blue haze…"". I just read an article in the travel section of the Guardian that suggests that there’s no better guide to Istanbul than the memoirs of a Nobel Prize-winning author. The author then claims to follows Orhan Pamuk’s literary trail through Istanbul. Considering that Pamuk spends most of the book talking about melancholy and wagging class to wander the streets while feeling melancholic I can’t really see how the book would be a good travel guide..

Moreover, because of its autobiographical nature, it tends to be intense and heavy at times so reading it at one go is not advisable. This is rather a book to be enjoyed as you sip on your cup of tea or coffee as it purs outside. I really liked it. My only wish was that the book should have included a bit more of the author's life.","May 02, 2020"
1648082,Ratih,"Title	: Istanbul: Memories and the City. Writer	: Orhan Pamuk. Year	: 2005. Language	: Turkish/English (translated into Indonesian). This is the third book of Orhan Pamuk I’ve read so far. It is interesting because it’s a kind of biography of himself revealing not only his past, but also the grow of the city in which he has been living for years and which shaped his life and characters.. He starts with his childhood, imagining himself having a twin brother in another house. It is him, I would say, but he feels that he never be that one. He feels different from the one in the other house. That feeling then drives him to be convinced that later on he has another life, another world. He is likely to live in two worlds, of which the one side is his world of art. When he draws or paints something (mostly scenery of Istanbul, Bosporus in particular), he feels like he exists in another world, far from his real life. He continues to feel so; even when he’s with his friends he can be different persons.. The best thing here is how the city he lives in kind of shaped his characters, sadness, and sorrow. He thinks that the fall of Ottoman brings the former kingdom to the fall Istanbul, and the fall of Istanbul brings him to the fall of himself. He’s grown up within and with the sorrow of the city. The sorrow, poverty, and backwardness of Istanbul are undeniable after the last war. He reveals the irony in which the people of Istanbul feels that being westernized and putting aside Islam as their religion are the only way to recover from their suffering of the fall. The people of Istanbul feel that being ‘western people’ are the best way to be back to the glory of their country as the ‘new republic’. Yet, they can’t really be the ‘western people’ because they are not western people in any sense. Silly, they even see the true Muslims who implement the real Islam are the backward people.. This book is very much interesting and amazing in that it can honestly state the tone of the writer and his personal feeling towards his beloved city. He’s not only honest in putting forwards his personal life and characters, but also in telling the secret of his family. By reading this book, I can precisely see how Turkey is, how the people are, how the growth of Istanbul is, and how the whole of the last civilization of Islam becomes.. Rating: 3.5","Feb 22, 2010"
7587956,Korkodus,"Mixed thoughts with a bias towards feeling bored .... An autobiography spanning over his childhood and teenage life and ending with: ""I don't want to be an artist. I am going to be a writer"". I loved the chapters where you get a bit about his life, his dreams, his fears, his predisposition toward a forever melancholic mood, his family (big brother complex, Oedip complex) and the society - those were witty and wise and having a strong hold of my thoughts.. Nevertheless, most of it was an ode to Istanbul (""I poured my soul in the city's streets and there it still resides""), the crevasse between East and West, the melancholic atmosphere that is so well and often described that it could as well be a main character. The regret and the acceptance of a new era which came after the Ottoman times and Istanbul the misfit in a world aiming at westernizing itself - ""Watch the Yalis burn down - this is the guilt, loss and jealousy we feel at the sudden destruction of the last traces of a great culture and a great civilization that we were unfit or unprepared to inherit in our frenzy to turn Istanbul into a pale, poor, second class imitation of a Western city"". Pamuk's soul and Instanbul's soul continuously intertwine ""For anything we say about the city's essence, says more about our own lives and our own states of mind"" and talk about each other. ""A mother trying to fill the void left by an often absent father hoping that if she denied this void, she could somehow keep the melancholy of the city from seeping into the house"". My fav is the chapter on religion. ""Although I was faintly aware of that, in theory at least, God's love extended beyond them (the poor) to everyone under our roof, I also knew that people like us were lucky enough not to need it"". ""My mom was the sort of person who believed in God just in case"". ""Fasting was something only backward people would do"". ""The stupidity of the peons, those who believed in God in excess"".

1787680,Mukikamu,"Orhan Pamuk’s book about Istanbul is an odd book on this blog, for it is not about a travel experience, but about a personal journey and the spirit of the city where Pamuk lived all his life. I must admit, I lived in Turkey for three years when I was a child, so the book brought back familiar sceneries and was thought-provoking in a peculiar way. This personal attachment made it impossible to read as a curious traveler and I clinged to those details of everyday life that brought back my own memories. I was entertained by the realisation of how exotic Istanbul sometimes seems, yet how very same lives teenagers of the ’60s led all over the world. The book also revived my own experiences about the part of Turkish soul that can not hide the hurtful disappointment caused by the fall of a majestic empire, but which is trying to cope with republicanism and westernization. Even, the obsession with fire-watching shows how the Turkish nation accepts its destiny of having to constantly rebuild from scratch. They feel weary, but -as I sometimes feel the book lacks to mention - still push forward. (If Pamuk would be acquainted with Hungarian mentality he would cheer up. Any Hungarian facing their difficulties and the ‘weltschmerz’ of a beaten history, would instantly fall into self-pity. We would declare things hopeless, before we would ever consider trying to do anything about it.) Pamuk writes extensively about various travel writers who visited Istanbul in the past and shaped the city’s image, as well as of his much admired, fellow Istanbul-based writers. The volume is therefore a uniquely mutant book that mixes personal memories with essays about the history and literary heritage of the city.. Oh, and I forgot to mention; Istanbul is a book of a Nobel prize winner. Not that it makes any difference, but there are some who care for marketing.. http://mukikamu.wordpress.com/2008/02...","Dec 09, 2008"
7361036,Sam,"One of my dearest friends handed me this book on one of the rare occasions we met during the final days of our Postgraduate lives.. I was dumbfounded three times by it because I've never read a memoir so skilfully and brutally constructed; Pamuk tears himself open and Istanbul along with it. But this is not a case of self-depreciating celebrity; this is a book about a person and a city coming to terms with who they are when everyone else around them is telling them who they should be.. Dividing the memoirs and the history into chapters, whilst weaving both facets together in a blur of heady acknowledgement and mourning for the past, is one of the most masterful aspects of Istanbul; they're long and engrossing throughout much of the book but their impact is heightened, punctuated, punctured by briefer encounters, carefully interspersed across the 400 pages, which means only one thing in my opinion; a reason to keep reading.. I know nothing about Istanbul. I'm not a tourist, I'm not a researcher; I'm barely even interested because I cannot tempt my mind to consider that there is a world beyond my own. I felt stupid and ill-educated until Pamuk described the same sensations.. This is a book that I will never read again. It's a book that I will pick up from time to time, choose a chapter, and indulge in the luxury of my own curiosity and melancholy. Pamuk's Istanbul is a book, memoir, city, and history that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.. Note: I'm conscious that I have said nothing negative about this book; the pictures were a delight but I often had trouble relating them to the passages that may have referred to their presence. I also felt that in places, the 'history' of Istanbul through Pamuk's eyes and study was left with little to say, but perhaps that is all part of his experience, and the reason why he wanted to write this book: to say something.. I only wish that I didn't share his melancholy with the accuracy that I do.","Jan 07, 2012"
2637392,Valie,"I found it a bit tedious to be honest. It was interesting enough as a background of Istanbuls history and culture but the narrator's navel gazing got a bit on my nerves after a while. Maybe this is an irreverent thing to say about a Nobel Prize winner. I normally quite like essayistic works about places (see my obsession with W.G. Sebald) but this was too much Pamuk and not enough Istanbul. While Sebald uses the places he describes as springbords for meditiations on history, place and memory, Pamuk uses the city Istanbul to write his own coming of age as a writer.. Maybe I just expected another book when I read the subheading ""Memories and the city"". Add to that the use of photographs throughout the book and the evocation of melancholia as a feeling permeating the city (hüzün), I only cloud end up expecting something Sebaldian and was disappointed. The whole hüzün spiel also smacks of sentimentalism to me anyway and doesn't evoke the being lost in history feeling I get when reading Sebald.. Regarding the photographs: I quite liked them especially Ara Güler's work is definitely very evocative and beautiful. The Istanbul of the photos (and of Pamuk's childhood and youth) doesn't really exist anymore at least not in the same form. Istanbul as a city is very dynamic and changing more so than the western European cities I know. Pamuk describes the developments in a very sentimental way but that is not nessecarily the only whay to see it. Of course an outsiders experience is different than that of a person who has grown up in the city and in Turkish culture but what I found fascinating in Istanbul is the emergence of the new and the drive and vitality there. And I couldn't find this in this book.. It took me ages to finish the book – I found it quite tedious – but I kept reading hoping to get a glimpse of how it is to live in Istanbul, even if you are a rich, privileged member of the society who mainly moans about a life he never even had.","Dec 16, 2012"
5968709,Agnese,"My rating is 3.5 stars. Weighed down by hüzün, the melancholy under which the ancient Istanbul crumbles on itself after the end of the Ottoman empire while trying to acquire the alien identity of a western city, this memoire drags on slowly and often boring.. There are many interesting episodes about the city history and its more or less prominent people, but they often go out of focus in the wordy narrative, drifting away as the account loses rhythm.. In the pages about his childhood, the author remembers how, after learning how to read, he used to read any signboards in the streets of Istanbul, just for the pleasure of giving sounds to the letters that he could now distinguish, without any interest in the words they formed and in their meaning. In the same way, I often have the impression that he writes long pages only for his own pleasure of putting down chains of words that flow away smoothly, without bothering much about making the story catchy and keeping his readers involved.. The pages I enjoyed more are the ones in which the author describes his wanderings in the alleys, poor backstreets, and among the ancient ruins of Istanbul where he finds the authentic soul of the city. Here he can also take a distance from the conventional reality that should direct and shape his professional and social future and, while taking in his city, he searches for his own identity. The hüzün that impregnates the city and the writer himself apparently leaving no hopes of regeneration seems to lift at least for a moment only when Pamuk catches glimpses of the Bosphorus, the only part of Istanbul that remains lively and resplendent in its beauty.. Also the portrait of his mother that the author depicts throughout the book and especially in one of the last chapters is tender and very well defined. She appears as a strong, practical, and sad woman, all qualities that transpire along with her beauty from her photos scattered in the book.","May 28, 2014"
657496,Jeremy Allan,"I am terribly ambivalent about Pamuk the man. Or, more specifically, Pamuk the Author-Character. He clearly believes in and promotes the cult of the writer, the cult of the artist, and the mythos that surrounds all forms of ""genius."" There is something wildly admirable about the fact that he so boldly sees these mythic qualities in himself, but that something is fairly well-checked by my distaste for myth-making.. And in this memoir, Pamuk the Author-Character reveals himself to be deeply confused about class, poverty, social status, and all kinds of other things that would make a good Marxist grimace. A central claim of this book, about belonging, about being trapped between cultures, seems deeply dependant on a conception of class and status that wouldn't bear much scrutiny. Mostly, it serves to promote the idea of the author as an exile in his own land, yet. belonging. .... Yet this book is gorgeous. There is no denying that despite his narcissism and his blindnesses, Pamuk has an incredible gift, and one that is not wasted on the city of Istanbul. He summons up the very melancholy that he wishes to describe and analyze, seemingly with easy. He also does it with a convincing relationship to the history of the city, particularly the literary history, and under the weight of so many expectations held by its people over time.. So perhaps the most frustrating thing about Pamuk is that while I mostly despise his ideas of the writerly figure and the writerly life, his work itself is still somehow magical. This does not mean his conception of authordom is in any way correct, but it means that I will have to continue to suffer through his mythos, if only because his books are so good.","Jun 02, 2012"
4905709,Samuel Mustri,"Is any city as mysterious or compelling as Istanbul? To be the seat of the Ottoman Empire for centuries only to see itself poor, downtrodden and defeated in the modern age must produce a melancholy unknown in the West. Everybody is missing the old, beautiful, imperial Istanbul, once center of the world.. Turkey's greatest living national treasure, Orhan Pamuk, gives us an insider's view of Istanbul. And he does so in the best possible way - by using his own life as a guide for Istanbul's intrigues in a highly personalized story of the city.. The book's central theme is an exploration of how relationship and birthplace make us what we are. The chief literary pleasure of the book has to be the chapter describing ""Huzun"" . ""Huzun,"" according to Pamuk, is a collective melancholy consisting of, in differing degree; longing, nostalgia and unrequited love. Mr. Pamuk explains how the experience of ""Huzun"" both limits and expands the life of Istanbul, its citizens and himself, as a quality central to shared identity.. Yet the book is extremely wonderful, especially when Pamuk talks about the experiences and paintings of the Western wanderers, who came to the city in times of the Ottomans. Unfortunately Pamuk often, perhaps necessarily, slips into didacticism in discussing the literary history of Istanbul; it often seems rather dry and in some ways Pamuk fails to bring it to life. As the writer, it is his responsibility to do so.. A non-native could not have written ISTANBUL and we should be thankful that it has a native son like Pamuk to do the job for us. I hope Turkey and its leaders understand what a rare ambassador they have in a writer of Pamuk's gifts.","Apr 10, 2014"
678506,Patrick McCoy,"I will be visiting Istanbul, Turkey for the first time soon, so I thought I'd read Orhan Pamuk's Istanbul: Memories Of The City (1991), for a little background on the famous city. It is a fascinating portrait of the city filtered through Pamuk's childhood and early life in the city, but also his appreciation for the city's history in which he has become an amateur historian of the city and its many phases of development over time. Central to this story and Pamuk's own is the concept of ""huzun"" (a culture specific word that suggests spiritual anguish and suffering). Pamuk writes authoritatively of this concept and constantly returns to it when describing his city and the experiences he had there throughout his life. Interestingly he also look at the city as it was personified by the native writers, poets, and journalist as well as the western visitors and artist who tried to capture its essence. This interest in the city was deeply tied to Pamuk's formative experiences such as his obsession with painting, his first love, and his dissatisfaction with architecture and his transference of his artistic sensibilities from painting to writing-this is where the narrative ends and perhaps another volume will follow that shows his development form his decision to become a writer and the actuality of it that would, I suspect, manifest itself in his first book. At this point I have only read one Pamuk novel, The Book of Red, however, it was sufficiently fascinating and thought provoking as this one to make me want to read more.","Oct 15, 2014"
2300199,Aylin,"Orhan Pamuk’s art reflects his view of Istanbul. When he was young, he sought joy and found it in painting a pretty view. There came a point when he matured that such painting no longer brought him the same type of simple pleasure he found in finishing a work. The pain and frustration he felt when struggling with a painting led him to abandon painting rather than explore new and unknown territories with his art. He is however a true artist and his gift finds mature expression in words if not paint. His medium remains Istanbul.. He walks through back streets of Istanbul to escape pain in his own life- where art is discouraged as a profession as it does not put bread on the table. This is a far cry from the civilization of art and abundance that thrived not so long ago on the very streets he walks. This contrast creates a gentle melancholy that hangs in the air of the city and seeps into the hearts of it's inhabitants.. In his walks, Pamuk is not most drawn to the remaining monuments of the Ottoman empire preserved by the country, but to sad ghosts that are forgotten in back streets that lean and are propped up and patched by the families that inhabit them.. Pamuk’s love for his city is pure in that it does not transform the object of his affection. He loves the city for what is and not for a (westernized) ideal of itself. It is the readers view of those back streets and of their place in the city that are transformed.","Aug 25, 2009"
97087290,Praveen SR,"The drive home through the roads of Thiruvananthapuram bathed in yellow light was something I looked forward to, for the experience of a city known for sleeping early, exuding its charm in its own quiet way. Now, it is a drive I dread, even though I don’t have to apply the brakes anywhere. The streets, even with those yellow lights, look desolate, deserted by the people who injected it with that lazy energy, giving it the feel of a ghost town belonging to a civilisation that has crumbled long back, the shop fronts without neon lamps merging seamlessly with the centuries-old buildings in the adjacent street.. Probably, those handful of people, still having to take the roads in any city across the world under the COVID-19-induced lockdown, could be experiencing something similar. It is amid this desolate mood that I read Orhan Pamuk’s ode to his city – ‘Istanbul: Memories and the city’. Early on in the book, speaking about some great authors who navigated between cultures and languages, he says that their imaginations were fed by exile and rootlessness, while his requires that he “stay in the same city, on the same street, in the same house, gazing at the same view”.. The all-pervading feeling that the book emanates is one of melancholy that flows through his life in the early years before he becomes a writer, the period in which this book is set, as well as through the city, which is going through an identity crisis, between the old ways of the former Ottoman empire and the ‘modern’ Western push being made by the Turkish republic. It has perhaps to do with the location of the city too, partly in Europe and partly in Asia.. The melancholy that Pamuk speaks about is a trademark Turkish one, which he calls ‘Huzun’, a melancholy that is communal rather than private, something that “brings us comfort, softening the view like the condensation on a window when a tea kettle has been spouting steam on a winter’s day”. That line could define the kind of view of the city that Pamuk paints for us. Incidentally, parts of the book is about his own tryst with painting in his younger days. Belonging to a rich family, whose riches won’t exhaust despite the business misadventures of his father, he gets a studio of his own, where he paints portrait after portrait of his model, referred only as ‘Black rose’, with whom for a short while he has an intense relationship.. Their love blossoms while exploring the city together, sometimes silently and without holding their hands. He takes her not to the Istanbul that the tourists see, but to the back streets, the underbelly. Incidentally, his first disillusionment with her happens when he discovers that she “sought a very different cure for her melancholy”, compared to his. What’s that cure? She tells him – “Feeling low today. Let’s drink some tea at Hilton. Walking through the poor neighbourhoods would make me feel worse”.. Later, as she abruptly disappears from his life, taken away by her parents, he cures himself with yet another journey, this time on a boat through Bosphorus strait that divides Turkey. He rides to the end of the Golden horn to Eyup, a little village which seems unreal to him in his state of mind. All through the book, it’s the waters of the Bosphorus that calms or excites the young Pamuk, who is eternally brooding, on land. As he himself says, “If the city speaks of defeat, destruction, deprivation, melancholy and poverty, the Bosphorus sings of life, pleasure and happiness. Instanbul draws its strength from Bosphorus.” Infact, one can sense Bosphorus flowing through the entire book. At night, he listens to the horns of the ships passing through the strait, while during day, he counts the number of ships passing, which also happens to be a habit of a lot of people there. He speaks excitedly of the fires engulfing the ‘yalis’ (the houses of the pashas of the Ottoman era), lining the Bosphorus and the explosions set off by ships colliding with each other on misty nights.. Some long, rambling chapters deal with his personal life, the unending fights with his brother, the troubles with his father, who is always absent from the house, and the fights with his mother, who advises him to stick to architectural studies, as artists can hardly survive in Turkey. Again, he takes solace in walks through the city – “Why was it that in such moments of unhappiness, anger and misery, I could find pleasure in nocturnal walks through the desolate streets with only my dreams to keep me company? Why instead of the sun drenched postcard views of Istanbul that tourists so loved, did I prefer the semi-darkness of the back streets, the evenings and the cold winter nights”. The long rambling chapters are certainly made up for by some exquisite pieces of writing that would appeal universally. The book is thus as much a story of his beloved city, as it is a story of his formative years. Parts of the book are reminiscent of his writings in ‘Other Colours’, which also contains his personal stories as well as impressions about his favourite writers.. Over the years of staying in that city, and looking at it in different times and moods, Pamuk finally unlocks the secret of looking at it poetically. “Once I had mastered this new poetic outlook, I chased with unchecked ardour after anything and everything connected with the city. Everything I touched in this state of mind, every piece of knowledge, every artefact, seemed like a work of art. …even the trembling windows of a ferry”. Images from each of the cities that I’ve lived in for considerable amounts of time flashed through my mind as I was reading that. But, above all, I realised that I would probably see Thruvananthapuram with a different eye after this, with quite a few works of arts waiting to be explored once again. For that though, I will have to wait. The desolate streets will remain so for many more days to come. One day, when the corona virus threat recedes, when people come out on the streets without viewing each other with suspicion, when the doors and windows open and when all the cogs that makes the city run starts turning again…I can chase with unchecked ardour anything and everything connected with this city.. PS – Not to forget, the evocative black and white images of Istanbul by Ara Guler, “the Eye of Istanbul”.","Apr 22, 2020"
225537,Mary Stephanos,"Nobel Prize-winning Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk has written a lovely and painful memoir of growing up in Istanbul during the 1950s and 1960s. Already devoid of much of its Ottoman glamor, Istanbul in the mid-20th century had turned into a city full of faded wonders and marked by huzun, the near-palpable melancholy that has gripped the city like a vise for about a century. Pamuk finds huzun in the burned mansions along the Bosphorus, in ugly modernist architecture, in the fatalistic attitude of the Istanbullus around him, and ultimately in his own personality. He embraces the melancholy as natural, inevitable, and argues that Western writers--caught up in the ""exotic"" nature of Istanbul--have typically missed the city's true nature entirely. In the course of the book, Pamuk reveals that perhaps he has exaggerated aspects of his childhood, making him less than reliable on several points. Nevertheless, the book is engaging, not least because it is filled with vintage black-and-white photographs of Istanbul, as well as of Pamuk and his family. Highly recommended for anyone who has visited Istanbul and wants a further taste of this extraordinary place.","Jun 04, 2011"

When I found out that I'll be visiting Istanbul for the first time in my life, I decided now was the time to read it.. At first I thought I'll be reading about Istanbul's rich history, what I found was completely different. Pamuk writes not about Istanbul's history but about it's emotions. It's more like ""if Istanbul could talk what would she say?"" Rather than historical facts.. The way he portrays the ""hüzün"" shared by the people of Istanbul is enchanting, to live in a city with souvenirs from so many fallen empires is not as easy as it may seem.. I ended up learning a lot about Istanbul, much more and much better than I had anticipated, a good part of the book was also an autobiography of Pamuk, yet both were intertwined in a fashion that is so admireable and so elegant, it is hard at times to differentiate between them..

Why, instead of the sun-drenched postcard views of Istanbul that tourists so loved did I prefer the semidarkness of the back streets, the evenings and cold winter nights, the ghost people passing through the light of the pale streetlamps, the cobblestone views, their loneliness?""

869258,Ara,"My reading this book coincided with my trip to Istanbul--it's a great historical city to visit with lots of great food. I like this book for Pamuk's inclusion of minority topics in the history of this city (ethnic, religious and gay minorities). But being in Istanbul while I was reading it, it seemed to me that the city had changed somehow from what he was describing. Having spent only one week in Istanbul as a tourist, I am not qualified to make that claim, yet somehow, although I observed many of the things that Pamuk described, I do feel that something new or different is going on now. The biggest problem I had with this book, though, was with Pamuk's point of view as a writer who was born into a well-off Istanbul family. He kept describing how melancholic the city is, how its old glory is lost, how his family used to enjoy a better position, and so, and quite frankly, this all seemed self-indulgent, repetitive and ultimately, for me, boring.","Apr 22, 2009"

While reading, I also kept wondering how Orhan Pamuk´s brother has been feeling about this book. He must have read it at some point and I am curious whether he resented his little brother about what has been written in there. And of course the mother´s condescending comments on his life choices were interesting to read. I think a lot of readers from Turkey would recognise these debates from their own lives and childhoods.. I could write so much more but I don't think it is necessary at this point.

The many photographs that litter the book are beautiful and provide a very strong glimpse into the world that Pamuk is describing.. The book goes back and forth between personal memoir and a memoir of the city (of sorts), which could easily not work as often I felt like there's not enough of one or the other, but after having finished the book I can tell you that I think the book works and is considerably wonderful.. One of my favorite aspects of the book is when Pamuk directly addresses the reader or the material in the memoir (namely the photographs), breaking the fourth wall, in a sense.

Having spent three weeks in Istanbul myself, Pamuk's vivid descriptions Istanbul's monuments, districts, and culture were particularly meaningful to me. As much as Pamuk loves Istanbul, he knows it is not perfect. In fact, the complicated history of Istanbul provides a powerful subplot of this book. As he witnesses his city grapple with its interesting location between Eastern and Western societies he only wants his city to remain true to its own roots. This same struggle can be mirrored in Pamuk's own life as he searches for his own roots and his niche in his city's culture.. I rated this book 4 stars. As much as I loved this unique history of a city, I found his overt usage of adjectives a bit much at times. This book is great for anyone who enjoys a great love story set in a complicated city.","Oct 12, 2015"
8458998,Akshay,"Huzun, roughly translated as melancholy, is a beautiful word. Huzun is the feeling that engulfs Istanbul, a city still dreaming wistfully of its imperial past, a city with its gaze set firmly on emulating the West. Pamuk gives his beloved city a dimension which most tourists who have seen only the postcard picture of a sun-kissed Istanbul by the simmering Bosphorous would never know; his Istanbul is the melancholy, decaying city of snowy nights and dark back alleys, of lonely figures walking home under the light of gloomy street lamps, and of dilapidated Ottoman villas. The huzun that affects the city feeds the huzun of its people, and vice-versa.. A more romantic and personal ode to a city, I have yet to come across. This book gave sadness a new shade of beauty, and made me long to be back once again at the bridge that connects the East to the West.","Nov 19, 2015"
32976590,Adrian Curtin,"Orhan's memoirs of his childhood in Istanbul portray a romantic but melancholy view of the city. He depicts his hometown as caught between the despair of its past and its own conflicted soul between western and eastern influence. A considerable discussion relates to Istanbul authors and the prior Europeans who chose to describe the city, presenting both the way that the city chose to define itself and the way it let itself be described.. The work is not a good peice of historical perspective on the city, but rather a sort of love letter from the author to his home. In his Istanbul, he describes both the light and the darkness that envelops the city and its citizens, and the way in which this collective experience interplays with his upbringing. It is a poetic perspective with a touch of despair.","Dec 29, 2015"
245802,Astrid Lim,"Ugh. It's actually a bit boring for me.. I was hoping for more glimpses into Pamuk's life, but he played a lot with references from painters and writers about Istanbul. Probably because this book is more about Istanbul than about Orhan Pamuk? I just can't enjoy this book that much because this is my first time reading Orhan Pamuk (and maybe that's the reason why I can't relate that much with him - I don't really know him!), and there are too many things that I don't understand in this book, especially some writer's names that Pamuk mentioned a lot to explain his thoughts about the city, and their writings about Turkey and Istanbul. I love that Pamuk put many photos in this book but I hope there are some captions explaining those pictures. For me this book is more about fragments of thoughts than an actual memoir. I guess this is the time to read more Pamuks to get to know him better.","Jul 09, 2016"
8401122,Nermy,"A brilliant autobiographical memoir through which Orhan draws not only a portrait of his city ' Istanbul ' but also the shared the inherited melancholy held by the society with dignity and respect. Highlighting again as before,in his books, the conflict between the west and east lying deep inside everyone, past and present. His fiction in expressing feelings, analyzing and viewing his city and ppl was irresistible that makes one totally absorbed in reading and visualizing. Actually, he makes me gradually attracted to Turkish culture unconsciously wz respect and love, eagerly to know more and better about their culture and beliefs wz reasoning and understanding. Gratefully, Learned much, indeed. Loved the book.","Apr 26, 2012"
65809,Janet,"Istanbul is a very non-linear, and to my mind, exceedingly personal account of the place, but with some shining moments of analysis of forces of nationalism and reaction to and thinking about Orientalism. Huzun (add umlauts) is my favorite new word. My most favourite detail in the whole book - shuddering ferry windows. Having taken many ferries in my life, I recognize this noise and there is something cozy about it. Many ferries and boats make this noise when leaving and arriving when the speed of the boat changes. However, the boat he is describing seems to do this all of the time - many not as nice. The photos (black and white) were beautiful and well-placed. Note to self: meyhane, pp, 164-5, 184-187 (religion), 216-7 (car sinking)","Feb 21, 2013"
15191353,Cameron,"Pamuk describes his native city incongruent with his own childhood. He paints a picture of a city veiled by “hüzün,” a melancholy characteristic of a place with a once magnificent past. Wandering the streets in search of his own identity as a student at a difficult stage in his life, it becomes apparent that this is a city that is personal, multilayered and sublime. And unlike the tourists, who usually seek out their own preconceptions, Pamuk revels in the city’ somewhat surprising contrasts, especially its cold winters, the snow-covered Ottoman roofs and bridges and the frequent ship disasters on the Bosphorus. From an early desire to be an artist, the realities of modern Turkey eventually push him into writing. A very enjoyable read.","Jun 16, 2013"
46718182,Maurya,"One of the best books I've ever read. The only book where I wished to keep reading the same pages over and over again. I'm not a proponent of the idea that books should exist to showcase the author's style but this book is written in such a heartbreakingly beautiful way, it's unputdownable even when the subject matter takes a backseat to his writing genius. This is not to say that the subject does not receive the attention it deserves; indeed Pamuk is at his best when he writes about the city that he is madly in love with - even when he is drawing up a laundry list of things he abhors about Istanbul. Too bad this passion doesn't extend to his fiction work - My name is Red turned out to be yawn inducingly boring.","Sep 09, 2015"
63978155,Nika,"After reading this book, I must say that I gained significant insight into the city of Istanbul, of which before I knew very little. In the book, Orhan Pamuk simultaneously gives his vision of the city and the emotions that it awakens inside of him but he also describes the beauty of Istanbul. However, he finds beauty in depths of ruined parts of the city. He walks through the darkness of Istanbul rather than wandering inside the heart of it. What has caught me the most was his description of the word ''hüzün'', grief, sadness with which all people of Istanbul are damned to live with. It's filled with hopes and illusions of a young Orhan who hadn't even had a thought that one day he will become a great author as he is today. I definitely recommend reading this book.","Jan 17, 2017"
418712,Christine,"This memoir by Nobel prize winning author Pamuk moved quickly enough. And though he did fall prey to the usual reflective self analysis that colors the genre, he was able to take a culturally specific brand of melancholy, what in Turkish is ""Huzun"", and portray his struggle within this state as universal and very relatable. The city of Istanbul is in every way a character, having it's own sulking whims and haunted beauty.. This book accompanied me on daily subway commutes- I only wish I could have read it while travelling in Turkey, since many street and neighborhood references were lost on me.","May 19, 2011"
1360868,Michael,"I’m very glad I read this book. It gave me not only a good look at Istanbul that I wouldn’t have had from just being there, but it also gave me a look at the author’s life. As the book drew to a close everything came together about his life, and the city (at least in the modern era) and family. It caused me to think a lot about my family and it made me deeply grateful. The book looks at Istanbul historically (particularly through the lens of the authors life), and he captures very well the ethos and the spirit of the place. He also writes about the artist’s life in that place. I really liked this a lot.","Dec 31, 2014"
5777647,jm,"Pamuk is way too much of an intellectual for my taste (right up there with Rushdie). Large parts of the book seem to consist only of enumerations of the (preferably French) authors he's read. He's also a melancholic (a word, by the way, which together with its Turkish equivalent hüzün occurs much too often!) intellectual at that, and gives us his grand theory of why Istanbul is so melancholic, or why he is so melancholic, but doesn't tell us much about him, or about the city, as the title would have led one to expect.. If it wasn't for the fantastic black and white pictures throughout, many of which by the excellent Ara Güler, I probably wouldn't have finished it.","Oct 25, 2016"

10079154,Michael,"I wanted to finish this book before I got to the city. I succeeded before our second and final stop in the fabled city. What a glorious place. This book is a memoir of the city when Mr Pamuk was young. It concludes when he is in Architecture school and has made the decision to become a writer. It was a fascinating look at a city that is no more. I had the pleasure of walking a couple of the neighbourhoods he described from his youth and they are completely different, full of cafes and modern buildings and shops. So a fascinating look at how a city can change. It is also a good look at how a middle class educated family lived in the 50's to the early 70's.","Aug 05, 2017"

Fascinating and irritating, Pamuk himself alludes to his tendency to embellish.

It has a lot of local spot references that may be hard to follow. Istanbul is beautiful in its own. hüzün. and suitable for artists, but might not be the best pick for a realists, modern-thinkers, and fun-seeking readers.","Jan 06, 2018"

15822302,Robert Sheppard,"WORLD LITERATURE CLASSICS FROM OTTOMAN EMPIRE AND TURKISH LITERATURE---NOBEL PRIZE LAUREATE ORHAN PAMUK'S ""ISTANBUL"" AND THE CONCEPT OF ""HUZUN,"" EVLIYA CELEBI--THE TURKISH MARCO POLO'S ""BOOK OF TRAVELS,"" MIHRI KHATUN & MIMAR SINAN--THE TURKISH MICHELANGELO OF ISLAMIC ARCHITECTURE, LADY MARY WORTLEY MONTAGU'S ""THE TURKISH EMBASSY LETTERS,"" FUZULI, & NEDIM----------FROM THE WORLD LITERATURE FORUM RECOMMENDED CLASSICS AND MASTERPIECES SERIES VIA GOODREADS—-ROBERT SHEPPARD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF. TURKISH NOBEL LAUREATE ORHAN PAMUK'S ""ISTANBUL"" AND THE CONCEPT OF ""HUZUN"". The Nobel-Prize winning Turkish author in his remarkable recapturing of the inner life of his native city ""Istanbul"" describes the concept of ""huzun"" as the peculiar shared malancholy for an irretrievably lost greatness that lives in the hearts of the citizens of his native city, the past capital and seat of glory of the Ottoman Empire. The ""saudade"" of Lisbon, the ""tristeza"" of Burgos, the ""mufa"" of Buenos Aires, the ""mestizia"" of Turin, the ""Traurigkeit"" of Vienna, the ennui of Alexandria, the ghostliness of Prague, the glumness of Glasgow, the dispiritedness of Boston share only on their surface some common sense of Istanbul's melancholy which is rooted even more deeply in the Sufi mystic's sense of spiritual loss on looking back on the fleeting moment of epiphantic bliss, unsustainable in this world, the ever-yearned ""close encounter"" with God's presence, which if momentarily aproximated, is forever thereafter lost this side of death. Pamuk's ""huzun,"" a Turkish word whose Arabic root (it appears five times in the Koran) thus denotes a feeling of deep spiritual loss coupled with historical loss, but also for the living, a hopeful way of looking at life, ""a state of mind"" as he puts it, ""that is ultimately as life-affirming as it is negating."". The Christian equivilant might be the emotional complex associated with Saint John of the Cross, whereby the seeker's anguish causes the sufferer to plummet so far down in his soul that he will, with innate bouyancy and the operation of the equal and opposite spiritual laws of counteraction, soar to its divine desire. Huzun is therefore,like other bi-polar narcotic addictives, a sought-after state, and it is the absence, not the presence, of huzun that causes the sufferer distress in withdrawal. ""It is the failure to experience huzun,"" Pamuk says of the craving, ""that leads him to feel it."" According to Pamuk, moreover, huzun is not a mere personal preoccupation but a communal emotion, not the mere melancholy of an individual but the black mood of millions shared, as they share their common history, which if past, is yet ever present.. Born in Istanbul, Pamuk, the first Turkish citizen to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006, is now Robert Yik-Fong Tam Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University, where he teaches Comparative Literature and Writing. His novels include ""The White Castle,"" ""The Black Book,"" ""The New Life,"" and ""My Name Is Red"" and ""Snow."". THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE (1300-1922). The Ottoman Empire rose from obscure beginnings around 1300 in the wake of the Arab Abbasid Caliphate's devastation by the Mongol invasion and in the presence of the slow deterioration and lingering dismemberment and death of the neighboring Byzantine Empire, whose capital of one thousand years, Constantinople, was one and the same city with Pamuk's Istanbul. The first leader Osman, from whose name the word Ottoman derives, and his successors began to dominate and unite the various Turkic tribes of Anatolia, the land of modern-day Turkey and consolidate them under a centralized Turkic and Islamic state. After a brief setback from their defeat by Timur, a new young Sultan, Mehmet the Conqueror thrust the Ottomans onto the world stage by successfully conquering Constantinople, ending the Byzantine Empire. Afterwards, under Selim and Suleiman the Magnificant the Empire was extended to include Egypt and North Africa, the European Balkans up to the approaches to Vienna, and finally Baghdad and Iraq, resulting in the transfer of the Caliphate, nominal dominion of all Muslims, to Constantinople the new Ottoman capital.. By 1600 the Ottoman Empire had become a superpower, far larger than any existing European state in both territory and population, which approached 20-30 millions, compared to only 5 million in England and 10 million in France. However, by the Law of Unintended Consequences the Ottomans sewed also the first seeds of their own demise, as their monopoly of the Far East trade with China and India resulting from their capture of Constantinople impelled Columbus on his voyage to China which led to the discovery of the Americas, the installation of Spain as the first global Empire and then to the growth of the rival global empires of France and Britain and Russia, the allies who would in their victory over the Ottomans and their German allies in World War I dismantle the Ottoman Empire forever.. In the meantime, however, several centuries of Ottoman reign would afford ample opportunity for the development of a rich literature, part of the common heritage of the world.. MIHRI KHATUN, SUFI WOMAN POET IN AN ARISTOCRATIC PATERNALISTIC AGE &. MIMAR SINAN, THE TURKISH MICHELANGELO OF ISLAMIC ARCHITECTURE. Mihri Khatun (1445-1512) was the most distinguished Turkish woman poet of the early Ottoman Empire. She came from a glorious Sufi family, a descendant of Pir Ilyas, the Sheikh of Amasya. Her intellectual family provided her with illustrious private tutors and access to the copious family library. She proved to have an inborn talent for poetry, and came to excel in the ghazal genre of love poetry. In addition, like the later grande dames of the Paris ""salons"" she occupied at striking figure in intellectual, governmental and artistic circles. Her ghazals were an expression of her amatory experience and a capacity for Platonic spiritualized love in the Sufi tradition. Many of her love poems were inspired by and dedicated to Iskender Celbi, the son of the world-renown Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan Pasha. Sinan was celebrated as the ""Turkish Michelangelo"" as he built or designed the great mosques that made such a striking contribution ot the world architectural heritage, such as the Suleiman and Sultan Ahmet Grand Mosques which still dominate the skylines of Istanbul and many other Muslim cities. Our first impression of Islamic architecture, a domed mosque flanked by four towering and pointed minarets, was a form created by Sinan. It can be said that he worked in the same spirit of the Rennaisance as did Michangelo and Da Vinci in that he borrowed the domed design of the Byzantine Christian Hagia Sophia from the past and reworked it in an Islamic format, creating the Islamic grand style of architecture we still celebrate in the grand mosques and such structures as the Taj Mahal in India. In fact he was a close contemporary of Michelangelo and Da Vinci, actually competing with Da Vinci in both submitting designs for a bridge across the Golden Horn in an international competition sponsored by the Sultan. Both Sinan and Michelangelo changed the face of architecture for centuries in their respective domains of influence and thus the term ""The Turkish Michelangelo"" is no exaggeration. Be that as it may, Sinan's son also inspired Mihri Khatun to leave an additional legacy to the world in her poetry, such as her renown ""I Opened My Eyes From Sleep:"". I opened my eyes from sleep, and suddenly raised my head. There I saw the moon-face of the love-theif, shining. My star of good luck had risen---I was thus exalted. When in my chamber I saw this Jupiter rise to the evening sky. He appeared to be a Muslim, but by his dress an infidel. And divine light poured from lthe beauty of his face. I opened, then closed my eyes, but he had vanished from my sight. All I know of him---he was an angel or a faery. Now she knows the water of life,. Mihri will not die until the Judgement Day. For she has seen that visible Alexander. in the eternal dark of night. Thus notably Mihri Khatun includes in her poetry both Muslim and Classical Greek references along with a spirit of Sufi longing after the beloved, divine or sexual, reminding us that the Muslim world was also an equal heir to Aristotle, Plato, Alexander and the Classical Greek and Roman heritage, along with the inheritors of the Western Renaissance such as Petrarch and Shakespeare. Both the Western masters of the Renaissance and the Muslim masters of the earlier Islamic Golden Age which preserved so much of the Greek and Roman heritage, saw and acheived so much each in their times, because, as Newton stated, ""they stood on the shoulders of giants,"" i.e., both Muslim and Western geniuses standing on the same Greek and Roman shoulders as the common heritage of both civilizations.. EVLIYA CELEBI---THE TURKISH MARCO POLO. Evliya Celebi (1611-1684) is often referred to by the nickname of ""The Turkish Marco Polo"" not only because of his extensive travels but also for his voluminous writings giving his impressions, social conditions, geography and in-depth cultural cultural insights regarding the lands and peoples he visited. He was the son of the chief jeweler of the Ottoman royal court and his family's immense wealth gave him the time and resources to devote himself to his chief and obsessive passion: travel. He traveled to every corner of the Ottoman Empire, from the Balkan domains neighboring Vienna to modern Saudi Arabia, into North Africa and through Egypt southwards into Africa, and then beyond the Empire into Russia and beyond. While not as extensive as the travels of Ibn Battuta or Marco Polo, his travels were extraordinary and his writing of them masterful.. LADY MARY WORTLEY MONTAGU'S ""TURKISH EMBASSY LETTERS"". By any standards, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689-1762) was an extraordinary worman who lived an extraordinary life at a time when few women had such opportunities. A countess and cousin to the great novelist Henry Fielding, she took advantage of her wealth and social position to educate herself to become a notable classical scholar, translator and poet, following in the footsteps of other aristocratic women of the French salons such as Madame de Sevigne. As a girl she was mentored by many illustrious tutors such as Mary Astell, who published and attempted a plan to found a Protestant women's convent dedicated to the intellect of women, and Bishop Montagu. Her later mentor, Edward Wortley Montagu's intellectual guidance became amatory, and her father refusing permission for them to marry, she finally eloped with him.. Like the ""precieuses"" or intellectual court ladies of the French salons she wrote and circulated poetry to closer friends and aristocratic acquaintances, in her social class it being considered ungenteel and unladylike to publish for the masses, and her writings became generally known only after her death. She proved herself, however, unlike the ""ladies of sentiment"" of the Continent, to be more interested in satire, wit and sex. Like Aphra Behn before her she was the object of scandal and admiration and dabbled in journalism, producing an edition of ""The Spectator"" for her friends Addison and Steele. She was a personal friend of Alexander Pope with whom she exchanged letters and poetry until they became enemies after he satirized her in his famous poem ""Epistle II: To a Lady."". Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's life became inextricably connected with the Ottoman Empire when her husband Wortley Montagu was named ambassador to the Sublime Porte and she accompanied him to reside in Constantinople. In the collection of letters later published after her death as the ""Turkish Embassy Letters"" and written during her residence in Constantinople she provides an intimate account of women's lives in both worlds, illuminated by her observations, thoughts, comparisons and contrasts. While Western men and writers such as Flaubert and Montesquieu fantasized about life in a Turkish harem as in the latter's ""Persian Letters,"" her sex allowed her to intimately visit and observe the reality. Ironically, she was able to enjoy greater freedom walking the streets of Constantinople in Muslim women's dress using the veil as a mask, than she could enjoy as an aristocratic lady in London, allowing her to make close observation of various classes of society of the Turkish capital.. Upon her return ot England she helped to popularize the Turkish practice of inoculation against smallpox, which was more accepted there than in Europe, publically inoculating her own two children to help overcome public fears of the vaccination process.. In 1739, at the age of fifty, she broke off her friendship with Alexander Pope and ran off to Italy with a bisexual writer, Francesco Algarotti, less than half her age and continued relations with him for the next twenty years until his death, though using her wealth to live in expatriate exile independently of both her lover and her husband. From Italy she wrote about her alienation as a foreigner and as a woman from all the worlds she had tried to inhabit. Returning to England only in the final year of her life at seventy-three her final words were: ""It has all been most interesting."". FUZULI---POET LAUREATE TO SULTAN SULEYMAN THE MAGNIFICENT AND AUTHOR OF LAYLA AND MAJNUN, THE TURKISH ROMEO AND JULIET. Fuzuli was the pen name used by Mehmed Ibn Sulayman (1480-1556) who is renown in Turkish letters as the court laureate in the reign of Suleyman the Magnificant, a writer of mystic and personal love poems, and, being a Shi'ite Muslim, on the tragic events of Karbala's history attached to the martyrdom of Hussein, successor of Ali. Like most Islamic poets, he wrote in several languages, his native Turkish, Arabic and the Persian language used in royal and scholarly circles, and wrote extensive prose works on philosophy, religious issues and literary criticism in addition to his poetry. His themes focus on the human emotions, mystic love, wisdom, Sufi mysticism and also court pangyrics celebrating the Sultan and the Grand Vizir. Though Turkish he spent almost all of his life in Iraq as it became a part of the Ottoman Empire.. His most famous work was his ""Layla and Majnun"" (Layla wa Majnum)a story of ""star-crossed lovers"" akin to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, also rendered by many other writers across the Islamic world such as the Persian Poet Nizami. It tells the story of Quys, or Majnun (The Madman)who fell insanely in love with his soulmate Layla. Prevented from marrying by her father who objectet to his poverty and scandalously lunatic behavious towards his beloved, he in desperation took up the life of a wanderer writing poems about her and observing her from afar. She marries another of her father's choice, but out of her love for Majnun refuses to consummate the marriage and dies of a broken heart. Majnun also dies of grief on her grave after inscribing lyrics of undying love on the neighboring rocks. Buried together, two trees grow on their graves whose trunks and branches are inseperably fused.. His own life followed a similar path of love, when as a young scholar he fell in love with the daughter of his mentor, Rahmat Allah. Illustrative of his love theme is his poem, ""Oh God, Don't Let Anyone Be Like Me!"". Oh God, don't let anyone be like me,. crying and disheveled. Oh God, don't let anyone be an addict of love's. pain and separation's blow. Always I have been oppressed by those merciless. idols, those beloveds. Oh God, don't let a Muslim be a slave. to those infidels. I see the moon-faced one, thinking of killing me. with her love. I'm unafraid, oh God, just don't let her change. her mind. When they want to draw from my body the arrowhead. of the cypress-bodied one. Oh God, let it be my wounded heart they take. but not her arrow. I'm accustomed to misery and cruelty--how would. life be without them?. Oh God, don't let my suffering be limited. nor her tyranny end. Don't say that she shows no justice, that she is. so unfair. Oh God, let no one but her be sultan. on the throne of my heart. In the corner of this tavern Fuzuli found a treasure. of delight. Oh God, this is a holy place, may it never. be brougt to ruin. NEDIM & THE COMING OF AGE OF TURKISH POETRY. Nedim (1681-1730), is the penname and a nickname meaning ""drinking companion"" used by Ahmed Mehmed Nadim, Poet Laureate of the Ottoman Empire and a close friend and drinking companion of Sultan Ahmed III and his Grand Vizir, Damad Ibrahim Pasha. Under Nedim's influence Turkish poetry came of age, acquiring a pure Turkish style and new themes, distinguishing itself from the classical Arabic and Persian poetry on which was modeled for many centuries. Nedim was also associated with Sultan Ahmed III's controversial Westernizing policies, comparable to those undertaken by Tsar Peter the Great in Russia around the same period, which in Turkey however resulted in a reactionary movement which deposed the modernizing Sultan rather than Peter's successful undertaking. His poem ""At the Gathering of Desire"" is addressed to ""Saki,"" meaning a court cup-bearer or beloved, a name later used by Edwardian British short story master H.H. Munro:. At the gathering of desire you made me a wine-cup. with your sugar smile. Oh Saki, give me only half a cup of wine. you've made me drunk enough. You crushed me under the hoof of a wild horse. that runs like fire. In those places flames rise up from my ashes. like cypress trees. Ah, east wind, you came to me with the scent. of my lover's hair. You made me love-bewildered like the huacinth's curl. With your beauteous grace my hair has been standing. like a jinn. With love you've made me mirror-colored from head. to foot. Don't make your crying Nedim drunk and devastated. like that. Saki, give me only half a cup of wine, you've made. me drunk enough. SPIRITUS MUNDI AND ISLAMIC LITERATURE. My own work, particularly Spiritus Mundi, the contemporary and futurist epic is also influenced by Islamic literary traditions. It features one major character, Mohammad ala Rushdie who is a Sufi novice in the Mevlevi order who is also a modern social activists in the Campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly for global democracy. He in the course of the novel is taken hostage by terrorists and meets the Supreme Leader of Iran, urging him to ""Open the Gates of Ijtihad"" or reinvigorate Islamic tradition with creative reasoning and openness rather than binding it to blind precedent and unthinking tradition. Another historical chapter, ""Neptune's Fury"" features the sojourn of Admiral Sir George Rose Sartorius in Istanbul as his ship is repaired after the battle of Alexandria against Napoleon's fleet in which the Turks and British were allies, experiencing ""huzun"" for the Byzantine past.. For a fuller discussion of the concept of World Literature you are invited to look into the extended discussion in the new book Spiritus Mundi, by Robert Sheppard, one of the principal themes of which is the emergence and evolution of World Literature:.

15090296,Elisabeth Sepulveda,"Wrote a response paper on this already, so copy/pasting the behemoth here as a review.. In short - really loved it.. Nearly a century after the end of the Ottoman empire, Orhan Pamuk’s book, “Istanbul: Memories and the City” describes the experiences of a young boy growing up in a city positioned between the East and the West, a place in which “the remains of a glorious past civilization are everywhere visible” amidst a sense of loss and decay (101). A few years before Pamuk’s birth in 1952, the first prime minister of the Democratic Party was elected in the first two-party elections in Turkey, and was hung eight years later in a coup. Turkey entered the Korean War and attempted to become a NATO member while in the midst of equilibration following Ataturk’s political, economic, and cultural reforms. While Pamuk’s narrative serves as a biography of both himself and his city, he omits many of these identifying historical details from his account, focusing instead on broader concepts through which to create an interpretive paradigm for the city. One concept which receives much of his attention, is the concept of Huzun—a sense of melancholy and nostalgia characterizing both the city as a whole and the individuals who comprise it. Although Pamuk seeks to accurately communicate life in Istanbul to his readers, he chooses a non-traditional method—highlighting the overarching ambiance of huzun over simple, factual descriptions. As he ushers his readers into the center of his heart and his city, he challenges them to re-assess their own relationship to place and space—ultimately using their resulting identification to develop a deeper and more dynamic appreciation for the city’s vitality.. To preface, Huzun is a Turkish word expressing “a state of mind that is ultimately as life-affirming as it is negating” (91). Its Arabic root is found five times in the Quran, describing both profound spiritual loss and a sense of honor and dignity. Paradoxical in nature, the sense of Huzun “does not just paralyze the inhabitants of Istanbul, it also gives them poetic license to be paralyzed”, placing them in a void of living that is somehow beautiful in spite of—or perhaps because of—its absurdity (104). And although Huzun denotes a sense of poverty, depression, and resignation, it is not characterized by individual solitude, but is “something the entire city feels together and affirms as one” (105). Pamuk contrasts this emotion with Montaigne’s western notion of “tritesse”—“the enemy of self-reliant rationalism and individualism” and “the source of countless evils”, degrading the soul of the individual (105). Pamuk instead emphasizes the collective nature of the experience, the huzun his people “absorb with pride and share as a community”, the closest he comes to a description of nationalism (94).. Huzun is vital to Pamuk’s account, both as unifying theme, and for use in interpreting accounts of his life and of the city. He devotes an entire chapter to describing the sentiment, incorporating definitions, contrasts, and examples, then continues to reference huzun throughout the duration of the narrative. Huzun is his motivation for loving Istanbul, for recording its history, and for endearing it to the reader. Indeed, he emphasizes its place in his written account by saying, “Huzun teaches endurance in times of poverty and deprivation. It also encourages us to read life and the history of the city in reverse. It allows the people of Istanbul to think of defeat and poverty not as a historical end point but as an honorable beginning, fixed long before they were born. So the honor we derive from it can be rather misleading” (104). Through describing the historical function of huzun, Pamuk emphasizes a fact perhaps related to his sweeping details—that rather than serving as a reminder of the city’s demise, huzun marks the creation of a new Istanbul, permeating the city in “its manifestations in the city’s streets and views and people” (99). Through describing huzun, Pamuk challenges his readers to step beyond their conceptions of an antiquated city into the idea of a city still alive, one which, through its admonition of death, has identified a starting point through which to begin living again. The city may be positioned between these poles of past and future, manifesting the tensions through “the history books in which children read about the victories of the Ottoman Empire and of the beatings these same children receive at home”—but it is still active and growing, moving towards its new history (97). Ultimately, huzun creates the conception of the place and space Pamuk lives in through establishing it, not as defined through its its relationship with the past, nor unrestrained hope for the future, but through a daily ecosystem of complex interactions between the city’s aesthetic, infrastructure, and people.. Although Pamuk spends much of the narrative describing the city that shaped him, he uses vivid images and interpretations to simultaneously shape Istanbul’s image for his readers. Indeed, he believes that activating parallels between the self and the city requires multi-directional movement, saying, “I have described Istanbul when describing myself, and described myself when describing Istanbul” (295). With the interfacing dualities between self and city, Pamuk fashions a construct in which his personal narrative functions as a microcosm of the larger city. At times, the parallels are explicitly defined, for example when Pamuk compares the disintegration of his family unit with the decline of the Ottoman empire: “It was a long time coming, arriving by a circuitous route, but the cloud of gloom and loss spread over Istanbul by the fall of the Ottoman Empire had finally claimed my family too” (17). In his description, the city’s gloom and sense of huzun actively infiltrates—even influences—the people and events within its borders.. And yet, even while influenced by the city’s huzun, Pamuk seeks to communicate his own individual sense of autonomy over the city, in which he discovers an internal locus of control. He describes his sensation as a “poetic outlook”, discovered during a walk in the district of Eyup. In contrast to larger Istanbul, the district is charming—almost too charming—with its exotic sense of the mystical East dissipating contradictions and tensions in reconciled perfection. Eyup derives “benefit from the West and westernizing Istanbul, while still keeping itself distant from the center, the bureaucracy, the state institutions, and buildings”—a perfect balance (354). And yet, although Pamuk is deeply invested in the aesthetics of his city, he finds the perceived perfection of Erup, specifically, unsettling, stating that he loves Istanbul “for its ruins, for its huzun, for the glories once possessed and later lost” (354). In the realization that his artistic passion develops from huzun, Pamuk arrives at his epiphany: “There were times—when every strange momento seemed saturated with the poetic melancholy of lost imperial greatness and its historical residue—that I imagined myself to be the only one who had unlocked the city’s secret; it had come to me as I watched through the windows of the Golden Horn ferry, and I had embraced the city as my own—no one had ever seen it as I did now” (353).. In Pamuk’s discovery, an individual sense of artistry emerges. Through identifying the elusive quality that defines Istanbul, Pamuk finds the paint and the canvas with which to recreate the huzun which compels him to create and inspires his creations in the first place. Where most of Pamuk’s friends experience wanderlust, Pamuk realizes his life source in Istanbul: “Their imaginations were fed by exile, a nourishment drawn not through roots but through rootlessness. My imagination, however, requires that I stay in the same city, on the same street, in the same house, gazing at the same view. Istanbul’s fate is my fate. I am attached to this city because it has made me who I am” (6). Pamuk believes he has found the key to Istanbul, that quality of “otherness” that resists classification, the huzun which makes it what it is. The complexity of the quality is partially based in the fact that it draws from a past melancholy to function in a present sense of poetic liveliness, of the artist’s sense of seeing an old city with new eyes—of breaking free from an imposed history which fashions its people with its melancholy, and allowing those people to re-create the city with their own.. A history written in such a way necessarily brings up questions of accuracy—whether Pamuk’s perceptions are shared by his counterparts, or merely the dreams of a growing boy. Through closely relating his story with Istanbul’s, Pamuk readily accedes to the fact that his account is highly subjective. As one who is, himself, fascinated by the depictions of Turkey recorded by other authors, he adheres to the concept that we see things, not as they are, but as we are. Most striking is the instance of the writer Kocu. Pamuk emphasizes the fact that Kocu “failed” to scientifically classify Istanbul by Western standards because the city is so “unmanageably varied, so anarchic, so very much stranger than western cities; its disorder resists classification” (169). Through its positioning in the “twilit place between East and West” Pamuk elucidates that the contradictions encapsulated in the city are not easily detangled—and that the expression of huzun creates the most accurate context for understanding the past and the present of Istanbul.. Other Turkish perspectives reinforce Pamuk’s idea of an unclassified Istanbul, a city in a state of flux, shifting from a melancholy past towards a revitalized future. Malicolm Cooper highlights the inherent contradictions within the country, noting the “switch erratically from the pursuit of European integration to attempts to become a regional Asian power” and its complex relationship with Israel (Cooper, 1). Pamuk’s ideas of Istanbul’s complexities are not exaggerated. In Turkey’s growth, the interplay between religion, culture, and policy require critical analysis to fully understand their interactions. Aerenlun Sorenson highlights the temptation to distill these complexities into simple factors, such as attributing social factors in Turkey to religious conflict between Islamists and Kemalists. He cautions readers to consider the exchanges more critically, saying that “Islamists and Kemalists alike have pursued the creation of an orthodox ‘Islamic Turkishness’ as a vehicle for expanding centralized authority”— challenging readers to consider ways in which Istanbul influences and is influenced by its internal groups (Sorenson, 625).. One of the factors Pamuk’s conception of huzun speaks most notably and almost prophetically to, is the transition towards a more hopeful future for the country. Metin Heper discusses Turkey’s march from the periphery to the core, beginning with Ozal’s economic reforms and continuing through to Erdogan (Heper, 155). Previous economic policy crippled Turkey’s infrastructure, so the transformational changes signify a movement towards more effective placement within the global economy. Aram Bakshian describes this new Turkey, in the present day, as a “rising generation of Turks who care about personal freedom and will not be bullied into silence. They represent a new political demographic that can’t be pinned down as strictly right wing or left wing, observant Muslim or secular (64). This young generation is still unclassifiable, still very Turkish, and yet they simultaneously represent the hope of a new future. They are “empowered, determined but also bewildered by what is happening. They have never been here before. And neither has Turkey” (64). While Pamuk certainly takes a unique angle of characterizing Istanbul’s history and context with huzun rather than historical details, his ideas gather support from relevant changes in Turkey during and after the events he relates.. Ultimately, Pamuk’s focus on huzun draws his readers into a new frame of reference when considering Turkey—one not marked by objective details, but instead a more relatable and encompassing essence. He readily admits the subjective nature of his account, saying that, “Once imprinted in our minds, other people’s reports of what we’ve done end up mattering more than what we ourselves remember. And just as we learn about our own lives from others, so too do we let others shape our understanding of the city in which we live” (8). Pamuk’s insight into his perspective does more than simply relate a personal story of Istanbul, however. Through introducing the seemingly-contradictory essence of huzun, the tensions of a city resisting classification, he challenges his readers to re-visit their own histories and perspectives. Near the final pages of the book, Pamuk reiterates this point: “But here we have come full circle, for anything we say about the city’s essence says more about our own lives and our states of mind. The city has no center other than ourselves” (349). Indeed, even as we are shaped by the places and spaces around us, Pamuk insightfully underscores the fact that we define both the nature of our present realities and the depiction of our historical pasts. Perhaps, even more importantly, Pamuk illuminates that it is not always the hope of future glory, but a reconciling with personal huzun, that both guides and catalyzes this growth process.","May 24, 2015"
53481457,HebatAllah Hassan,"MY GOD! When is this gonna eeeeeeeeeend... HUMPH. (Written when I reached half of the book). Now that there are only 100 pages left: ""It's getting worse. The organization still sucks. The writer's inferiority complex is getting severer. The writing style is still dry and BORING. There is no glimpse of hope. And finally, I'm crying... waaaaaaaaaaaaa2."". (15/3/09) Now that I ,AT LAST, finished it off (or was it that finished me off?!) I have this to say: INSUFFERABLE, ATROCIOUS, SHAMEFUL; I don't have the slightest doubt that the man must have won the Nobel Prize in writing ""Boring Literature"". He does not even know how to write about his own city, FOR GOD'S SAKE! I have read books by Nobel Prize winners in which they depict their own countries: Naguib Mahofouz depicted Egypt, particularly Cairo, with SUCH passion that I have never seen the like of. Pearl.S.Buck, wrote about China with SUCH zeal that you would even imagine that you can smell the places she describes in her novel, and hear the voices of her characters. Even writers before the Nobel Prizes age, take Dickens for instance: England is dancing on the very pages of his books. But this! THIS! THIS! Oh my God! Was it really Istanbul he has been describing on the pages of this book all the time? It's true that the book is semi-non-fiction, but still, this cannot be the way to present a city as great as Istanbul!. Let me present the problems in this book, one by one; to tell you why I think he UTTERLY failed to really present Istanbul, and why I asked myself: ""what has this book added to what I already know about Istanbul?"" only to find Mr.Nothing (don't ask me why, but I think that ""Nothing"" is a male) staring me in the face:. 1. If you are to present a city, with its ""huzun"" and melancholy, with its great lost history and wounded present, will you start talking about ""your own life"" describing the ""Pamuk apartments"" you lived in and the lost fortunes of your once-very-wealthy family? Is your family the centre of the city you live in? Will you confine yourself only to describing and discussing everything that relates to the creme-de-la-creme aristocratic society you once belonged to, and has been longing to belong to once more? Will you completely ignore ""the poor"" who, I'm sure, represent the majority of your own city. Personally, I don't think that this is the right thing to do.. 2. The organization of the book SUCKS, a chapter about how ""Istanbul"" has been viewed in different books by different writers that Mr.Pamuk read. And then you get a chapter about the ""Pamuk Apartments"", and the lost glory of the Pamuk family. Then you get a chapter about a famous writer that Mr.Pamuk is influenced by. Then you get a chapter about the city (or rather, the upper class) longing for westernization. Then you get a chapter that discusses an aspect about the city, the Bosphorus or the ships or the funny signs hanging everywhere or religion (the chapter is mostly dedicated to telling you how Istanbul sucks after the disintegration of the great Ottoman Empire, and the lost glory it once had). Then you get a chapter about his feelings towards the city. Then you get a chapter about Mr.Pamuk's family and personal memories shared with one or two of his family members or friends. And the cycle is repeated all through the book, but of course, not in the same order. Is that really Istanbul? Well, that's left to you to decide anyway, and I decided that it's NOT.. 3. Mr.Pamuk, in my opinion has to find a solution, or rather a cure for the inferiority complex he SUFFERS. He definitely feels so inferior for being born as an ""Istanbullu"" and for belonging to Istanbul. He definitely feels ashamed of the city, and I had a feeling while reading that book, that he is actually telling the reader: ""you see what I do have to put up with?"". Take that for example: ""Why were we born in this particular corner of the world, on this particular date? These families into which we were born, these countries and cities to which the lottery of life has assigned us- they expect love from us, and in the end we do love them from the bottom of our hearts; but did we perhaps deserve better?"" or this, when he is talking about the Turkish men of Istanbul: ""finding myself imprisoned be the legs of men jostling toward the exits, a dark airless forest of wrinkled trousers and muddy shoes....[...]... I thought of men as part of some lower and more vulgar race and was thankful most of them belonged to the streets outside."" Would someone explain to me, please, what would the city be if not ""the streets outside""? Or would someone please tell me, really, if you want to depict the people of a city, why would their ""wrinkled trousers and muddy shoes"" interest you so much, unless you are, an insufferable SNOB? Or take this, for example: ""Still, the melancholy of this dying culture was all around us. Great as the desire to westernize and modernize may have been, the more desperate wish was probably to be rid of all the bitter memories of the fallen empire, rather as a spurned lover throws away his lost beloved's clothes, possessions, and photographs. But as nothing, western or local, came to fill the void, the great drive to westernize amounted mostly to the erasure of the past."" Or take this: ""it comforts me to know that for the night at least we are safe; the shameful poverty of our city is cloaked from Western eyes."" Or this one: ""It is no more possible to take pride in these neglected dwellings, which dirt, dust, and mud have blended into their surroundings, than it is to rejoice in the beautiful old wooden houses that as a child I watched burn down one by one."" Or this one: ""I looked down on families that were as rich as we were but not as western."" What a SNOB! And it's left to you to imagine what he did to the poor in this book (as though they weren't there; they were just ""the servants""... his servants. There is even a whole chapter entitled ""The Rich""! Isn't it enough that he has been talking about them all through the book!). Or take this one: ""The filth of the side streets; the foul smell from open rubbish bins; the ups, downs, and holes in the pavements; all this disorder and chaos; the pushing and shoving that makes it the sort of city it is- I am left wondering if the city is punishing me for adding to the squalor, for being here at all. When its melancholy begins to seep into me and from me into it, I begin to think there is nothing I can do; like the city, I belong to the living dead, I am a corpse that still breathes, a wretch condemned to walk streets and pavements that can only remind me of my filth and my defeat."" Or take this one:""I don't like afternoons in spring when the sun suddenly comes out full strength, mercilessly illuminating all the poverty, disorder and failure.""! And I'd like to tell you, Shelfari fellow, that book is full of those pathetic whining sniveling paragraphs and sentences. It was horrible!! And what frustrates you is that you look at the pictures of Istanbul included in this book, and you feel like you are on the verge of tears; the city is SO BEAUTIFUL, but it seems that our fellow is programmed to see only the mud and the filth of its places and ""the wrinkled trousers and muddy shoes"" of its people.. But again, there is no denial that there is something wrong with the psychology of this man. He enjoys himself be imagining that he is killing people! He says that he takes pleasure in ""reading about murders in Istanbul papers""! He says that he ""enjoyed the air of disaster that descended on [his] family and [his family's] house when she [his mother] and [his] father quarreled"". He says, when talking about the ram in the Feast of Sacrifice during his childhood: ""my heart didn't bleed every time I saw the doomed ram frolicking in our yard. I would even feel glad that we'd soon be disposing of this ugly, stupid, foul-smelling animal."" What is this?!!! And it goes without doubt that the man is an insufferable SNOB; even when he talks about his love for painting, he does not forget to talk about his painting tools, not forgetting of course to say: ""which my father brought to me from France"" or ""which my mother brought to me from England"". So, when I saw in a line: ""hoping to convince them that I was not an effete snob"", I couldn't help writing a little note beside it: ""You are my dear."" So, I think that the inferiority complex that Pamuk clearly suffers from in this book is greatly attributed to his snobbery.. 4. It's true that this book has good imagery sometimes, but the style of writing sucks; it's so full of listings: ""to do so and so and so"", ""to see so and so and so"", ""to hate so and so and so"", to like ""so and so and so"". And I felt the painter in Pamuk's writing, not the writer. When he talks about the steps of painting that he used to undertake as a little child; when he loved painting so much, he says that after finishing a painting, he would go back to it, and add some details to it, and sometimes, it made his paintings look worse, not better. Somehow, I felt, in so many parts of this book, that he did the same with his writing, and I felt that his writing suffered consequently because of this; so many paragraphs, and even sentences seemed to me that ""they just don't fit in there."". But in the end, I wasn't really at a loss in knowing why I think Pamuk UTTERLY failed to describe Istanbul in this book: He writes, in the chapter before the last:""I've never wholly belonged to this city, and maybe that's been a problem all along."" And I do greatly believe that he is totally right about that; ""it was the problem all along"" in reading that book. And, when he talks about his outings with his snobbish lover, he wonders thus: ""We'd be chased by children trying to sell us trinkets or simply to talk (Tourist, tourist, what is your name?), but she didn't get upset, as I did, or ask, Why do they think we're foreigners?"" Strange, isn't it? He has just answered his own question a few pages before; IT'S BECAUSE ""HE NEVER WHOLLY BELONGED TO THIS CITY"". So, why, on earth, should the city feel that it belongs to him? But what bothers me most is the question of ""why did he ever write about Istanbul if he feels that he never really belonged to it?"" Does anyone have an answer to that? Why couldn't he just spare us reading that book? But I was so full of tearful laughs (couldn't actually decide whether they were the tears of the unhappy frustration, or the laughter) when I saw this so very ironic line: ""As for the city's poets and painters, most had their eyes so firmly pinned on the West that they couldn't even see their own city."" Was he really trying to say that he isn't one of them? Oh, God! I didn't know that such brilliant people could win Nobel Prizes! So, not really believing that he won it, I did a bit of research to make sure of it, and knew that his masterpiece is ""My Name is Red"" (no wonder ""Istanbul"" is not the one). So, I think I wouldn't mind giving him a second chance and read this one, but I don't think I would do it before a loooooooong time... at least when I'm fully healed of this book. I mean, he must have won the Nobel Prize for a reason, mustn't he? So, I hope ""My Name is Red"" won't suck as this one.. The chapter before the last is entitled: ""To Be Unhappy is to Hate Oneself and One's City"", and I'd say: ""To be Unhappy is to Read This Book"". So, if you hate that book in the middle of reading it, and you are, unlike me, not afflicted with the urging desire to finish a book no matter how it sucks, then leave it unfinished, and you have all my happiness for you.","Mar 07, 2016"
66635467,Keen,"3.5 Stars!. “To be travelling through the middle of a city as great, historic and forlorn as Istanbul, and yet to feel the freedom of the open sea-that is the thrill of a trip along the Bosphorus. Pushed along by its strong currents, invigorated by the sea air that bears no trace of the dirt, smoke and noise of the crowded city that surrounds it, the traveller begins to feel that in spite of everything, this is still a place in which he can enjoy solitude and find freedom.”. A Nobel laureate, who has spent all of his life (50 years at the time this was published), living in Istanbul, there is surely no one better equipped to write about the city than Orhan Pamuk. I have only read one of Pamuk’s novels so far, “The New Life”, which I really struggled with and didn’t particularly enjoy. Never one to write off an author after only one book, I was determined to try again, and I came across this after it was recommended by Paul Theroux in one of his books.. From ancient Byzantium to modern day Istanbul, he really captures the heaving metropolis in all its melancholic beauty. He charts the decline of the Ottoman Empire and its eventual death after WWI, which would later transition into Ataturk’s Turkey. Pamuk discusses the inevitable modernisation/westernisation and how it would lead to many conflicts of identity, values and culture within the city and country. He also explores the constant tension that rises between East v West, which is always going to be an issue in a city that sits where Europe and Asia meet. He mentions the role of the many ethnic groups, like the Greeks, Armenians, Kurds and Jews who seem to have experienced mixed fortunes, dependent on the prevailing political wind.. Pamuk cites many of his primary influences and passions, like the four so called, “Melancholic writers” consisting of the memoirist Abdulhak Sinasi Hisar, the poet Yahya Kemal, the novelist Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar and journalist-historian Resat Ekrem Kocu. He also talks about his love of the work of the German painter, Antoine Ignace Melling. In particular, he chats at some length of his enduring affection for the unfinished “Istanbul Ansiklopedisi”, that was put together by Kocu over many years, and holds many mysterious treasures and rewarding titbits between its pages.. This is a memoir that is not afraid to be whimsical, but does this without descending into outright waffle. Pamuk recalls the riots, religion and revolutions that have taken place, but also opens up about more personal matters like his relationship with his close family, his time at school, dabbling with architecture, and of course, falling in love which ties in nicely with his love of painting. The Bosphorus clearly plays a huge part in the city and in the architecture of Pamuk’s memories, from counting the ships that would pass by his window, to the dramatic fires that would occasionally break out, after various accidents and disasters. It often plays centre stage in one capacity or another.. He talks about the importance of the French writers, and friends, Gerard de Nerval and Theophile Gautier. He makes a really good point in showing how often, the residents of the city, relies on the published work of foreign travellers for the most accurate and detailed historical accounts of Istanbul.. This book is bursting with a vast number of black and white photographs, and some are genuinely excellent, capturing the many different sides of this huge city, from the grinding poverty to the stunning vistas. Many of these images came from the vast archives of fellow Istanbullu, Ara Guler, who has dedicated decades to taking them and preserving them.. This was an interesting read, and I felt that I came away with a better appreciation and understanding of Istanbul. Pamuk certainly sells it well, but he also isn’t afraid to expose its many flaws on the way. As he concludes towards the end, “I was slowly coming to understand that I loved Istanbul for its ruins, for its huzun, for the glories once possessed and later lost.”","Sep 26, 2017"
13752846,Humza Hussain,"To the Sufis, huzun is the spiritual anguish we feel because we cannot be close enough to Allah, because we cannot do enough for Allah in this world. A true Sufi follower would pay no attention to worldly concerns like death, let alone goods or possessions: he suffers from grief, emptiness and inadeuqaucy because he can never be close enough to Allah, because his apprehension of Allah is not deep enough. Moreover, it is the absence, not the prescence, of huzun that causes him distress. It is the fialure to experience huzun that causes him to feel it; he suffers because he has not suffered enough; and it is following this logic to its conclusion that Islamic culture has come to hold huzun in high esteem. If huzun has been central to Islamic culture, poetry and everyday life over the past two centuries, if it dominates our music, it must be at least partly because we see it as an honour.. If I am to convey the intensity of the huzun that Istanbul caused me to feel as a child, I must describe the history of the city following the destruction of the Ottoman Empire, and - even more important - the way this history is reflected in the city's 'beautiful' landscapes and its people. The huzun of Istanbul is not just the mood evoked by its music and its poetry, it is a way of looking t life that implicates us all, not only a spiritual state but a state of mind that is ultimately as life affirming as it is negating.. My starting point was the emotion that child might feel while looking through a steamy window. Now we begin to understand huzun as, not the melancholy of a solitary person, but the black mood shared by millions of people together. What I am trying to explain is the huzun of an entire city, of Istanbul. I am speaking of the evenings when the sun sets early, of the fathers under the street lamps in the back streets returning home carrying plastic bags. Of the old Bosphorus ferries moored to deserted stations in the middle of winter, where sleepy sailors scrub the decks, a pail in their hand and one eye on the black-and-white television in the distance; of the old booksellers who lurch from one financial crisis to the next and then wait shivering all day for a customer to appear; of the barbers who complain that men don't shave as much after an economic crisis; of children who play ball in between the cars on cobblestone streets; of the covered women who stand at remote bus stops clutching plastic shopping bags and speaking to no one as they wait for the bus bus that never arrives; of the empty boathouses of the old Bosphorus villas; of the teahouses packed to the rafters with unemployed men; of the patient pimps striding up and down the city's greatest square on summer evenings in search of one last drunken tourist; the crowds rushing to catch ferries on winter evenings; of the wooden buildings whose every board creaked even when they were pashas' mansions; of the crowds of men fishing from the sides of the Galata Bridge,of the tired old dolmuses, of the dim lights that you seen on an evening on the boats crossing from Karakoy to Kadikoy, of the simit vendors on the pier who gaze at the view as they wait for customers, of everything being broken, worn-out, past its prime, of the crowds of men smoking cigarettes after the national football matches.. It is by seeing huzun, by paying our respects to its manifestations in the city's streets and views and people that we at least come to sense it everywhere: on cold winter mornings, when the sun suddenly falls on the Bosphorus and that faint vapour begins to rise from surface, the huzun is so dense that you can almost touch it, almost see it spread like a film over its people and landscapes. Istanbul does not carry its huzun as an illness for which there is a cure or an unbidden pain from which we need to be delivered': it is carried by choice.","Dec 28, 2018"
274906,Howard Cincotta,"What a delightfully idiosyncratic book!. Orhan Pamuk offers an account of his childhood and youth through his changing memories of the city where he grew up, supplemented by feverish studies of the authors — Turkish and Western — who wrote about Istanbul in the 19th and 20th centuries.. The result is a fond, sometimes dyspeptic, often melancholy, frequently haphazard tour of a city long caught between its Ottoman past and partially Westernized present. Along the way, he provides a portrait of the artist as a precocious child and angst-ridden adolescent.. The many black-and-white photographs of mid-20th-century Istanbul — and the Pamuk family — make the whole enterprise feel like a wonderfully written family album, one that Pamuk is showing you personally over drinks as you watch ships glide up and down the city’s fabled Bosphorus.. Pamuk’s Istanbul is not today’s metropolis, caught in the vise of a construction frenzy, failing economy, and an increasingly anti-democratic government. It is instead the sad city of past decades, haunted by the wreckage of a defeated imperial past, and struggling with an incomplete and unsatisfying attempt to Westernize along the model set forth by Ataturk. It was a relatively poor city, an economic and cultural backwater whose residents were often embarrassed by the exoticism — pasha palaces and dervish lodges — that most attracted western visitors. It was, however, redeemed by its peerless skyline, unique history, polyglot peoples, and ancient monuments.. Growing up, Pamuk witnessed many of those relics of the Ottoman past either fall to ruin or be destroyed by fires. The fiery destruction of wooden Ottoman mansions, or. yahs. , became so common that residents often gathered in picnics to witness them.. For Pamuk, the key to understanding 20th-century Istanbul is a species of urban communal sadness known as. hüzün. , or the “melancholy of the ruins.” Pamuk himself revels in this moody malaise, and he traces its influence to several of the city’s greatest writers — Yahya Kemal and Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar — who explored the city’s ruined churches, abandoned mosques, and poor neighborhoods after World War I for “an image of a melancholic ‘Ottoman-Turkish’ Istanbul.”. Pamuk still lives in one of the apartment buildings of his childhood, where he once toddled among relatives living on different floors, a pampered child full of fantasies and dreams. He later attempted to become a painter like his French impressionist heroes, notably Utrillo. His family wealth proved large enough that even his father’s multiple business failures couldn’t squander it all. All the while, he and his brother competed for the attentions of their beautiful mother, trapped in an increasingly unhappy marriage.. For the most part, however,. Istanbul. consists of Pamuk’s wanderings through the city — physical, literary, and metaphorical — much as he did as a youth, alternately celebrating and criticizing its evocative if often forelorn vistas. After all, who can resist a chapter devoted to the city’s ferries entitled “The Smoke Rising from Ships on the Bosphorus”?. Pamuk suffers a tragic first love with a girl he calls Black Rose, and in the aftermath, realizes that he has no interest in becoming an architect, as his parents expect. He sinks into despair, walks the dark streets, explores more ruins, drinks and smokes, and drives his mother to despair about his future. Only those from outside the tale — the reader and the author himself — know what an extraordinary future he has in store for himself.","Oct 04, 2018"
72341080,Bob Newman,"neo-nostalgia. I remember the Boston of my childhood, though I remember Marblehead (a small town to the north) much better because I actually lived there. The two places had certain sights, sounds, smells, and ""feelings"" that, for the most part, have vanished like a morning fog off the Atlantic. But anchoring all those sensory aspects of the places was history, a giant kaleidescope of shifting people, institutions and events that created the then present, that created the new present, and will create the next present. I can't imagine Boston or Marblehead without that history.. Orhan Pamuk chose to write his great love for his city in a strange form. He weaves himself and his personal history into the picture, but completely avoids any historical details. I wonder whom he wrote for ? If for that ""western audience"" he refers to so often, there is not enough history to make sense of why Istanbul became such a melancholic, declined, fallen, poor, neglected place (at least he says it was). Fires and accidents, rain and snow, the hiss of tires slipping on old cobblestone alleys in a city that once ruled a big part of the world. If he wrote for a Turkish audience, his style of describing his family and his personal behavior would probably turn them off, along with his emphasis on Turkish cultural poverty. Maybe he wanted to ""send a message"" to those who insist too much on ""Turkishness"", by mentioning the now-mostly-disappeared non-Muslim minorities quite often. Maybe, but I conclude that he wrote it for himself---full speed ahead and damn the torpedoes to come. Pamuk writes of western painters and travellers and their views of the city in the 19th century and how they influenced him. He also writes of Turkish authors and how they viewed the city, though I have never seen any of their work in translation (meaning I have no idea how they would resonate with me). I liked this gambit, though I knew nothing about those Turkish writers. What I liked best is how he describes the city itself, how he walked around it as a child and a youth, how he steeped himself in the decay of the old Ottoman heritage before all the old mansions burned, before concrete apartment blocks sprang up like toadstools to sweep away the sad wooden houses that had seen better days. I loved the chapter on smoke from the funnels of steamships in the Bosphorus, and above all I liked the dozens of black and white photos of bygone days that fill the pages. It's a world class essay of nostalgia, but done in a very new way.. It's an interesting way to describe a city and write the first part of an autobiography. It's not a travelogue. There's not a single map---as if all the readers would know the geography of Istanbul. This is not Istanbul for visitors, this is Istanbul for those who loved it (who could AFFORD to love it) back in the Fifties and Sixties, when it had not been inundated in a huge tide of immigrants or refugees from the countryside and abroad, when Turkey was a poor, slow country. I saw it, once, briefly then, when Pamuk was an eleven year old kid. The dynamic, vital, amazing city of 2017 bears little resemblance to that other Istanbul. I understand why he wrote the book; I know a little of what is lost. To know that, you couldn't find a better book than this.","Dec 22, 2017"
3024716,Geoffrey Fox,"Pamuk projects his personal melancholy — hüzün in Turkish — onto this once-great city, interspersing reminiscences of a privileged but cloistered childhood with meditations on writers and artists who have portrayed the city.. Istanbul’s hüzün, he tells us, is different from the tristesse that Claude Lévi-Strauss found in tropical cities such as Delhi or São Paulo, because “in Istanbul the remains of a glorious past civilization are everywhere visible. … For the city’s more sensitive and attuned residents, these ruins are reminders that the present city is so poor and confused that it can never again dream of rising to its former heights of wealth, power, and culture.” (p. 101) Sensitive and attuned though he may be, he appears unaware that Delhi had “a glorious past civilization” of its own, even more ancient than Istanbul/Constantinople.. Flaubert, Gérard de Nerval, Théophile de Gautier and other foreign visitors help shape Pamuk’s vision of what the city was like before he knew it, and also, he argues, shaped the way of looking at it of later Turkish writers, particularly “the great fat poet, Yahya Kemal”; “the popular historian Reshat Ekrem Koçu”; the memoirist Abdülhuk Shinasi Hisar; and the novelist Ahmet Hamdi. Tanpınar. (Note: in Turkish, ı is a different vowel from i with a dot; it’s pronounced roughly like “uh” in English.). To me the most interesting chapter was “The Rich,” the class from which Pamuk’s family was descending (falling) throughout his childhood, which includes this acute observation:. “If Istanbul’s westernized bourgeoisie gave support to the military interventions of the past forty years, never strenuously objecting to military interference in politics, it was not because it feared a leftist uprising (the Turkish left in this country has never been strong enough to achieve such a feat); rather, the elite’s tolerance of the military was rooted in the fear that one day the lower classes would combine forces with the new rich pouring in from the provinces to abolish the westernized bourgeois way of life under the banner of religion.” (p. 183). His personal story here goes up to about age 20, when, in the final sentence, he declares that he is going to be a writer. His reminiscences of childhood help explain some of the peculiarities of his fiction, for example his childhood fascination with an imaginary double (“the other Orhan”), which is the central theme of The White Castle, and his fascination with miniaturists and meticulous reproduction of familiar scenes, as in My Name is Red. And the many photographs and other illustrations, one or more on almost every page, all in black and white, seem to confirm his vision of his own and his city’s hüzün.","Jun 13, 2017"
19798520,William Peace,"Istanbul, translated by Maureen Freely, is one of five non-fiction works by Pamuk in English. It is, as the subtitle suggests, a reflection on the Istanbul the author knew as a child together with his family memories. There are black-and-white photographs on every couple of pages, some dating back to the mid-nineteenth century, and some as recent at the 1960’s; most are of ‘old Istanbul’ but there are family photographs, as well. The ‘old Istanbul’ photographs are a vehicle for commentary on the writings of European and Turkish literati regarding the culture, style, history, art and visual perspectives of the city. Clearly, Istanbul was (and is) a unique city: its rapid growth, its human crossroads of East and West, its unique wooden architecture (which frequently went up in smoke), the presence of the Bosporus with all its maritime energy, and the air of melancholy (húzún) arising from the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the subsequent economic decline, and the cultural ambivalence between East and West.. Perhaps what is surprising about this book – part travelogue, history, autobiography, artistic and cultural commentary – is that it is an integral whole, seamlessly shifting themes without confusing the reader. This, I think, is all down to Pamuk’s fondness for his city and his skill as a commentator and a writer. One can set the book aside for a day or two, but one is drawn back into its dream-like flow. The attraction is, in large measure, due to the characterisation of the boy, Orhan, his brother, his mother and father, the larger family and their declining circumstances. The one criticism I have is that a map of the city should have been included. There are frequent references to districts in Istanbul by their Turkish names, but one has no idea of the geography which is an omission for a piece of writing which is otherwise so visual.. Istambul is a very pleasant reading experience.","Jan 19, 2018"
55464407,Rahul Singh,"I am sitting to write the review for this book after a day of having read it because the question “Where do I start?” has been tossing over and over in the deep burrows of my mind unable to find a clear path. Orhan Pamuk has moved me with his autobiographical narration. Right from the choice of the titles to each chapter to the pictures complimenting the texts, each and every word and effort that has gone into this introspection has been admirable. Pamuk has situated his life and, interestingly, let it evolve through his beloved city Istanbul. The city that has seen the rise and fall of an empire, the city that was once like a bride decked with the richest jewels shattered down to poverty, unemployment, violence, ethnic cleansing; it has all been captured by the author judiciously and with a note of sigh. Personally, I could empathise with Pamuk and his longing to stay grounded, to be rooted, to never leave his city which is perhaps how I feel towards my own city. It was beautiful to read the melancholy that has cloaked Istanbul and Istanbullus, Pamuk’s ownership of this hüzün at a personal level is explicit in the understanding of how much we own our city and how much more it owns us. Even though it was a narration of Istanbul and the changes it has undergone since the 1950s, Pamuk, being a raconteur, engages the reader in a puzzling story of his family belonging to the upper stratum of the Turkish society at that time. I would not recommend this book if you still haven’t read any of Pamuk’s fictions, there’s one particular book which I think has strong correlation with Pamuk’s life. Maybe read all his books and then find out which one I am referring to? Lastly, I would like to thank my mentor, my dear friend Prothoma Rai Chaudhuri for gifting me this beautiful present; just like Pamuk, we share the same rootedness for our own city.","Jun 07, 2019"
2698659,Roberta,"Publishers need to be careful with the way they advertise books. The cover of this book states ""A declaration of love"", ""An irresistibly seductive book"", and that perhaps sent me off in the wrong direction. The book makes sense only once it is finished. Up until page 250, this is a dark, depressing description of a dying, decaying city by a grown man describing the boyhood of an unhappy little boy.. It is only in one of the last chapters, when the now-young man falls in love and then is separated from this first love of his, that he confesses that ""Istanbul seems such a melancholy place to"" him because of having first walked those streets with her.. He also confesses in the chapter about fighting with his brother that he is and always has been prone to exaggeration. Keeping these two pieces of information in mind, the book's tone seems a lot more fitting - through his personal lens, Pamuk describes the shabbiness of Istanbul, its historically important leftovers, the diversity of cultures in the city, the Bosphorus, which is so important to the lives of the people living near it. He discusses Istanbullu writers and painters, which helps him position his writing among theirs, as well as the impressions and comments of foreign visitors, such as Flaubert and Nerval, in order to position Istanbul's changing environment within their Western ideas of the East.. What is important to keep in mind is that this is a book a lot more about Pamuk's childhood and family than about the city of Istanbul, and that despite being published in 2005 by a writer who has lived out his whole life in the city, the story only takes us up to the 80s, giving off a skewed perspective of the grand, diverse metropolis that the city is now.","Mar 17, 2020"
31918976,Myra Beatrice,"Orhan Pamuk’s 'Istanbul' comes across as partially a memoir and partially a discussion of his musings as he has wandered his home city, pondering its changes and his perceptions of the city over time. It struck me towards the end how the parts of the book which really are just relations of parts of his own life (where he tells the reader about his first girlfriend, his struggles staying interested in school, etc.), that most memoirs describe the experiences of people who have led exotic and thus ‘interesting’ lives due to fame, political turmoil in their lifetime, etc.. 'Istanbul' does not fit in to this category. Instead, the aforementioned sections come off as an ordinary person telling us about himself living through the same kinds of things that most people from middle to upper class families go through. These sections, for me, formed the least interesting sections of the book. I gave it 3 stars not because I ‘liked it’ (as Goodreads’ system classifies), but because it was indeed well written and I couldn’t particularly fault it; it was just that it also was not a particularly interesting book to me. Pamuk does have some insightful things to say, but most of his musings on the beauty of the ocean, the naturally artistic aspect of aged buildings, the melancholy of knowing that you are the same as everyone and that everyone is living in more or less the same way, being possessed and influenced by the same things, were all things I’d mused on myself and thus felt no need to read 368 pages on.","Apr 06, 2018"
2769809,Susanna Paul,"A reflection on the beauty of melancholy--told as a history and memoir of the decline of a city and empire. I picked this book off the shelf because I knew hardly anything about Istanbul. I really enjoyed the first few pages so I decided to check it out. My favorite parts of the book were his recollections of his childhood (especially accounts of the Bosphorus river, and the old life in the giant wooden mansions lining it) and the dozens and dozens of pictures that littered the pages. They were lovely, magical, and melancholic, and helped the slow pace of the writing go by faster. But the most interesting bits were scattered throughout--his explanation of the cultural tension when the city's artists, intellectuals, and rich were trying to Westernize themselves and their creations. These leaders no longer wished to lead in an ""Eastern"" fashion but also were not able to be truly ""Western,"" they could not effectively create good art in either tradition. This movement brought about the subsequent decline of the entire city, and the ~100 years of melancholy that has cloaked every citizen until they see it as treasured and beautiful. Reading it was a bit like reading Dostoevsky, hard to put into words, but I think that is because I can never truly understand the old East.. ""For me it has always been a city of ruins and of end-of-empire melancholy. I’ve spent my life either battling with this melancholy or (like all İstanbullus) making it my own.""","Nov 15, 2018"
18333415,Linda Munroe,"Orphan Pamuk writes of his life growing up in a city that has been a pivot on the cross roads of history for hundreds of years. I have often wondered how people who live in cities that have a long and ancient history relate to that history and Orphan Pamuk explores this complex circumstance in a surprizing and interesting way. When we visit a city with a person who is native to the area we always have a much more interesting experience of the place. Pamuk tells us many things about this city we could learn only from a local and yet we are left wanting more. This book is very much his experience and is limited to his lifetime and his perspective -- hence the subtitle.. Memorable quotes: 1. .... despite everything the world had to offer (friendship, love, sleep, food, playing games, watching things) and although the opportunities for happiness are limitless... life is also full of sudden, unexpected, fast-flaming disasters of every size and shade of importance (p. 199).. 2. ..... male culture with familiar female stereotypes: zest for romance. association of sex with sin, filth, trickery, decepton, perversion, degradation, weakness, disaster, guilt and fear..

5786937,Steve Miller,"Not bad. I most identified with the book when the author would talk about the back streets, the poor neighborhoods away from tourist areas. His use of gloomy weather as a backdrop to the Bosphorus, huzun, the ruins. It spoke to me, mostly, because I grew up next to a unique and wondrous body of water (Puget Sound) that backstopped a dingy, smelly, rather poor and hopeless city (in my case, Tacoma, Washington). Unlike Istanbul, Tacoma has no glorious past and can never hope for a renaissance and future glory the way Istanbul can. Unlike the author, who still lives his city and has come to love his city, especially the warts, I left as quick as a could.. I have questions for the author, the first and foremost being ""why didn't you leave Istanbul?"" With his whole life ahead of him and a family that probably still had the means (the author's older brother attended an Ivy League school, Yale I believe), did he ever explore Europe, or the world? These are questions he didn't address in the book, focusing solely on his city. As a result, from my point of view, it is less a memoir and more a defense of huzun and the melancholy. This book reads as a life not fully lived, a life that at first is resented, then settled into, then eventually loved. I can't give this more than three stars.","Jan 18, 2020"
42705755,Shane,"Another five star read from this author which does not startle me at all. The pleasure I took from this volume was also very high. It was wonderful to find out that some tropes he used in his most vividly discussed masterpiece he took from his life. Also, the reminiscences of me, my quarrels with parents on the grounds of my plans for the future that I found in the history of young Pamuk were making me feel nostalgic and glad. I also adored from the bottom of my senses the black and white photos that were appearing here and there in the book. This was a pure enjoyment for me to read the used version of it and even the fact that I poured a huge dose of coffee on it did not change it, even deepen it if it makes any sense. However, I have to say that I loved ""My Name Is Red"" more due to its magical, poetic style that was almost visibly beautiful. I can understand that it may be grounded in the fact that it is harder to write about ourselves than compose a fable, especially for a writer. I have to admit that Pamuk is rapidly becoming one of my favorite writers. I hope to get back to him very soon. When I will learn Turkish I am going to read ""My Name Is Red"" - one of the best books I have ever read - in original version one day.","Jun 01, 2019"
20647130,Harperac,"I ended up loving this 360 page book. It's a bit of a funny combination of memoir and... whatever you call a travelogue set in your home city. At first I thought I wouldn't enjoy the memoir aspect, just hearing about the random details of Pamuk's life. I've disliked Pamuk since trying to read ""Snow"" a while ago, so I had no patience for the ephemera of his early childhood. But really, what he's doing is exploring the city through the history of his experience of the city. And that turns out to work really well.. He also introduces us to the artists and authors who bring him closer to the city. Here it helps that he's spent his whole life trying to understand Istanbul through the eyes of other witnesses. He introduced me to some interesting Turkish authors , and also gave an Istanbullus' perspective on the orientalism of Nerval and Gautier.. The book starts off light, but by the end it's very heavy. It reaches a great climax with a story of Pamuk's first love. It's beautiful, sad, powerful, and perfectly rendered. I almost wonder if it's a fabrication, since it fits everything so well. Another section, entitled something like ""To Hate One's City is to Hate Oneself and to Hate Life"", is very powerful.. In the end, I feel like I might have to give some of his novels a try.","Jun 01, 2019"

They also included Snow in the package, and though I’d read it (See the April 24, 2007 comments.), Susanne hasn’t, so thanks to them.. Why Turkey? For one thing, they’re not on the Euro yet, so things are reputedly cheaper. For another, we have friends with connections, so that will help reduce expenses some. Finally, though, it’s always been such an exotic crossroads of religions, nationalities, ethnicities. You can swim where Byron swam if you want to (I don’t), and it’s a great complement to our trip to Greece, where we stood on Rhodes, saw Turkey no more than a SF-to-Oakland’s distance away, and realized graphically how interrelated these peoples have been for centuries--millennia.. Our friends say you can take a water taxi from their place on the Turkish Aegean coast and have a great dinner at a restaurant on Lesbos. I recall a church on Mykonos named after Saint George whereon a classic icon was painted of George on a horse slaying a dragon at his feet. Except that the dragon is a Turk. I remember all the tales of sultans and harems and the Ottoman empire, which in all my long academic career I’ve studied only as a footnote. And there’s a place in Istanbul where you can put one foot on Europe and the other on Asia. And many folks we’ve talked to say you shouldn’t miss it. So we won’t. However, it won’t be because of Pamuk’s book on Istanbul.. The man is a wonderful writer, and Istanbul is a fiercely honest examination of himself, his native city, and their parallel development from his 1952 birth to the present. However, as a promotion for the beauty and virtue of Istanbul nee Constantinople nee Byzantium it’s a loser. Pamuk has lived in Istanbul for the entirety of his fifty years. Not particularly remarkable, but it is remarkable that he has lived in the same building, a starkly undistinguished high-rise apartment house of that depressing 1950’s utilitarian architecture that has infected so many cities the world over. His family started out wealthy. His grandfather built the apartments. His father and uncle spent most of their lives frittering away through unsuccessful schemes the fortune their father had garnered. Similarly, from Pamuk’s point of view, Istanbul, and by extension Turkey and the Turks have frittered away the glories of their Ottoman past.. Since the mid-to-late nineteenth-century dissolution of a 300-plus year old empire that had been in decline for some time, Turks have been living among ruins. With neither the riches nor, apparently, the inclination to repair or recover the prosperity of the past, the crumbling walls, palaces and mansions one finds throughout the city are emblematic of the depressed spirit of a depressed people. Pamuk even devotes a whole chapter to what he calls Huzun, a special form of melancholy endemic to Turks--or at least Istanbullus--alone. Left without material or spiritual resources of their own, they look to the west for inspiration. Not surprisingly, the results are distinctly unsatisfactory.. Pamuk details not only various Western writers’ responses to Istanbul (Gautier, Flaubert), but Turkish writers’ response to the responses. The Turks seem unable to get in touch with their own feelings about their homeland, but are condemned to filter it through a Western consciousness. All this is complicated by the admirable and largely successful efforts of the famous Attaturk, who arabacized the alphabet and strove to secularize all aspects of Turkish life. Unfortunately, according to Pamuk, this resulted in a cultural chauvinism which ignored the contributions and vitality of the thriving Jewish, Greek, and Armenian cultures that had helped make the empire a glorious economic and ethnic crossroads. Ironically, then, the successful drive for a strong national and cultural identity resulted in further isolation.. Throughout, Pamuk connects his own personal, artistic, and educational development to his perceptions of Istanbul itself. He sees in his family’s declining fortunes a reflection of his country and culture’s diminution. He walks the poor neighborhoods and wallows in the hopelessness of their decrepit grime, watches the glorious old wooden mansions along the Bosphorus burn and crumble, no one with the money or inclination to repair or restore them. He has some talent as a painter, but seems unable to find, or at least value, his own style, instead seeking to imitate. He likes best those painting of his that are the best copies of other--usually western--artists rather than those of landscapes in front of his face.. This sense of depression, of living in the shadow of Europe pervades Snow as well. It’s striking how the mood I described in my comments about Snow also fit Istanbul:. Westerners seldom get a chance at insight into the mind of the Muslim world. I’m not talking here about political posturing or slaughter of innocents or quaint costumes. I’m talking about a first-rate artist showing us what it means to live constantly with the idea that your culture is inferior, playing catchup with a world that has passed you by and judges you while glancing over its shoulder as it speeds far down the road ahead. It’s not an idea you necessarily accept or live by, but it permeates your world like a bad smell you can’t get rid of.. Pamuk has chosen to live amid that smell, and he’s made the most of it. I just wish he and his countrymen--if indeed his mood does reflect those of his countrymen--had a more joyous time of it. I certainly hope we have a better time of it. In the meantime, Orhan’s bad moods have made for my good reading, and I’m grateful to him for it.","May 08, 2012"
10064754,Jamie,"7 April 2018. ----------. On page 66 now, and I started off slowly. Initially, I thought it would be easier to appreciate this book if I'd actually been to Istanbul. Now that I'm past the 50-page mark, I'm thinking perhaps it's best I've not yet been. The more I read, the more Pamuk's writing constructs in my mind's eye and imagined version of the city. By the end of it, I'm certain that imagined city will be as real as my own 'true' memories of other cities. And, if/when I go to Istanbul, I will have known not one but two of those cities.. 22 April 2018. -----------. It's been a few days since I finished Istanbul. Though it took me longer than I would have liked, and some parts were harder to get through than others, I still give it a solid 3.5 stars. It's more autobiography than travel writing, even though Barnes & Noble has it shelved in the latter category. I learned the names of many neighbourhoods, and am now quite familiar with the architectural and topographical features of the city, but there is none of the formulaic language that is found in one form or another in books written about places by those who have visited or immigrated there. Pamuk describes his city to the reader as he experiences it, and never really endeavours to explain its features to someone who may never have visited Istanbul. Perhaps, in part, he knows the numerous, marvellous black and white photographs that fill the pages of this book are enough. I loved those photographs, but I wished they came with captions to show the year and specific place. I suppose including such pithy information would have spoiled their effect. And in any case it seemed quite clear that the Istanbul shown in those photographs is no longer in existence, which saddened me but also felt fitting, somehow. The melancholy that pervades Pamuk's memoirs, in the form of its explicit use in his prose, or its presence in the shadowy, decaying grandeur of the photographs, seeped into me as I read each chapter. I think, for some time at least, I shall not be able to think of Istanbul without feeling that sadness.. Structurally, Pamuk's memoirs reminded me of Manguel's The Library at Night, or A History of Reading. Each chapter is dedicated to a different aspect of the city, or Pamuk's life in relation the the city, and so my level of interest in and enjoyment of each chapter fluctuated, but never dipped down to boredom or impatience. Still, I think it best to approach this book without any expectations or demands; the reader will, I suspect, get more out of their reading if they allow Pamuk to take them gently by the hand and guide them through the bygone Istanbul of his childhood.","Apr 07, 2018"
12894307,Javier Ormeno,"I got a Spanish version of this book like some weeks ago. I haven't read a novel in a while and I was delighted by the level of ""the City""details provided by the author. This is a book about image, accompanied by several photos and illustrations. Images turn into memories of a long gone past and a slippery present.. I lived in Ankara and always saw Istanbul from afar. The sense of vision generates a distance with regards what is seen. An objectification or estrangement of what otherwise could be familiar. With each visit to Istanbul, my beloved Bosphorus and a forgotten deity that used to live close to a castle, I realised that it was not only me but Istanpolites having this feeling of current experiences turning into distant memories. The image of a lover by the hotel window watching the boats sailing the Bosphorus and Golden Horn, the sight of the city from a promenade in Moda, enjoying a tea at the Hilton with Uskudar far beyond the windows, the little streets of alleys where to steal a kiss. All these turned into a longed past, something to miss.. Pamuk captures this mood of Istanpolites in words that mirror images. Maybe not only ofIstanpolites but Turkish people in general.","Sep 02, 2018"
69777126,Nanny,"Seeing how everyone thought this book was absolutely amazing makes me actually feel bad about not liking it as much. It's an okay book. I've read worse but I've also read better.. Orhan Pamuk's writing style is simply superb. He made it very easy for me to picture the Istanbul he saw growing up and sees when he was writing this book. Orhan Pamuk is also incredibly good at evoking feelings through words. He can make you FEEL the city he experiences. That's quite a feed and I have to give him credit for that.. That however doesn't mean that you have to LIKE what he makes you feel. I'm generally not a very melancholic person and I don't enjoy that feeling. However, ""Istanbul: Memories and the City"" is extremely melancholic which serves its purpose in the narrative but stopped me from actually enjoying a good part of the book.. I might come back to reread this book at some point just to see whether my opinion on this might change. Until then it will however not get more than 2 out of 5 stars from me.","Jul 25, 2017"
53182318,Bjørn Kleiven,"I am not completely convinced this is 5 stars, however I've never read a book quite like it. The mesh of urban orient transformation of city history, a metrography, and abyssinal biography of the author. Thereby I give 5 stars, and not 4. It's a bit slow at the start, though it really starts rolling past halfpoint, and I really enjoy it. It has a lot of images, and they deserve a much bigger display, and for the future should be elaborated in an appendix of a larger images, like most art books of today, much like Arthus-Betrand books. Certainly more footage of referenced writers and artists, from black and white images by Ara Guler to colors of Utrillo and urban images of Istanbul today. Luckily we have the internet, and can browse through Istanbul.. I won't go into the Huzun, but let you the reader discover it's beauty even so low and dark.. For all that is interested in world history and the link of east and west, with humanity, a highly recommend this book. And I am drawn to reread Orhan Pamuk's ""SNOW"".","Jul 22, 2018"
44239899,Pratiti,"I wanted read Pamuk for a long time. But which book do I start with?His tone and themes are both intimidating and moreover they are translations. Suddenly I came across Istanbul and it was the perfect book to start Pamuk. It transformed the way I saw the eastern vs western conflict.. We met the young Orhan in the dark apartments of Pamuk Apartments. Just like the darkness in his home, a darkness prevails in the city he describes. The educated trying to be westernized, the westernized trying to be rich and rich trying to be religious. Pamuk, with a magical tone describes the city, a bundle of conflicts with continuous metaphors from his own life.. The book, though semi- autobiographical hardly ever talks about the Orhan: the writer. It is about Orhan : the son, the brother, the lover and more importantly the painter. The book encompasses those years of Pamuk life when being a writer never occurred to him.. Pamuk is a master of imagery and the book provokes vivid images of mid century Istanbul. The Bosphorus feature heavily in the book, but is provocative and serves it's purpose.. This is a difficult book, but give it a try. A new door of literature opens up through Istanbul.","Aug 05, 2017"
29509433,Amirtha Shri,"Pamuk has beautifully broken his life into bits, labeled them and arrayed them in a semi-linear sequence. The beauty of the entire novel is emitted by his deep love and admiration for his city and enhanced copiously by his sophisticated eye for detail, charm and artistry.. Pamuk drowns you into the black and white city of his and the terms like Hüzün which are best left untranslated are employed to describe a myriad of emotions and his attachment for Istanbul's authenticity. The photos too are black and white to match the nostalgic, painful beauty that Pamuk aims to showcase and the photo journey along with his narration makes you feel part of his family, the city and the Hüzün.. As Pamuk starts talking about K Melling's artistic brilliance and eventually moves on to his admiration for Gautier, you are seamlessly carried by his transition from an artist to a writer. This is one of those few books that ended very perfectly for me.","Aug 22, 2018"
63720890,Georgina,"For those already familiar with Orhan Pamuk's work this gives a good background to his writing style- the use of memory and place to explore his relationship to Istanbul.. Littered with authors, illustrators and photographers who have made this city their subject, it gives us lots of interesting persepctives from which to view the city. In particular Pamuk prizes those who have had an intimate relationship with Istanbul and he gives us good contrasts between well known European authors such as Flaubert and Gaultier to lesser known Istanbullus such as Kocu and Ahmet Rasim. Though an interesting account of Istanbul, the first person perspective is at times problematic. For this reason you feel you have finished the book without any real sense of all of Istanbul's layers. It is in the end an account of the declining aristocracy and middle classes of Istanbul told through the authors memories- a subject ultimately at the heart of most of his novels but begs to reach beyond this.","Apr 25, 2019"
70100482,Zo ,"Lovely and beautiful book. Does a great job of mixing his interiority with his reflections on the city. The painting of the city maintains interest, and he evokes the melancholy that defines his conception of the city well. That being said, I think the book’s best moments involve his personal introspection, or at least when he blends the two topics. He is one of the (many) writers whose observational skills astound. Particularly in documenting little tics of human behavior. Felt similar to Proust and Sebald in many ways, but also certainly has his own unique style/approach. I enjoyed the first-half more than the second because I felt like things got a touch repetitive, but it’s possible that was due to external factors influencing my reading experience (and in some ways the repetition formally mirrors his reflections/melancholy). The very end became obvious a while before he got there, but still comes off with a thrill.","Jun 10, 2019"
63911735,Adam Mohd Noor,"I was fortunate to have found this deluxe edition which contains over 400+ illustrations and photos of Istanbul.. The book itself is highly melancholic and exposes Pamuk at his personal best. It's strange, reading this book and looking at the old photos reminds me of my times in Istanbul. I felt closely connected to the locations photographs felt like was perfectly slotted into the photos whether it was crossing the Galata Bridge or eating Balik Ekmer in Kadikoy.. What I like the most about this book is that it tells a different perspective / prism of Istanbul. Westerners are guilty of promulgating Istanbul as an exotic and romantised place whereas the locals are trying to desperately shape itself as a western post-Mustafa Kamal state.. I like reading this book as it gave a truly account of not only the grandeurs of Istanbul but also the everyday aspects to the city, somethg that we, the Sultanahmet-confined tourists may never have seen before during our times in Istanbul.","Apr 18, 2020"
6683940,Souvik Jana,"In this detailed and emotional book, Pamuk has mixed his childhood memories with his city of childhood, Istanbul. The economic fall of once affluent Pamuk family has been intertwined with the city in decline after the fall of the Ottoman Empire.. Within the description of the landmark churches, mosques, Bosphorus and Galata bridge, Pamuk narrates his growing up, the relation between his family members, their emotion in different and difficult times and his own. With the light and shadow of cobblestoned bylanes and old unpainted wooden. Yalis. , he describes the melancholy of. hunjun. that has descended over the people of the once affluent city.. Though there's little mention of the historic Greek city of Constantinople and he refers to the rest of the country only as 'province', in this nostalgic book Pamuk tells us how the people of Istanbul came to embrace the melancholy of. hunjun. and from an architecture student interested in painting, he became a writer.","Nov 01, 2018"
6185344,Agnes Goyvaerts,"I really enjoyed this quite unusual memoir and tale about an amazing city. At times it was a strange read, took some imagination to follow the writer's descriptions. I most enjoyed and was glued to his descriptions of Istanbul as it was, and how he experienced this melancholy and how he recons it hangs over his city, it is the concept of Huzun. Huzun (an Arabic word) denotes a feeling of deep spiritual loss as well as a hopeful way of looking at life. This is beautifully described by Pamuk.. I was amazed and had no previous knowledge of the urge by many Istanbulians wanting to be like the 'West'.. This book is a brilliant portrait of a city, it is about it's decline and also about its treasures, its old timber houses and the Bosphorus.. I could not put it down.","Oct 04, 2017"
50122778,Ana,"Maybe I am not the right person to give an opinion, because this is the only book by Orhan Pamuk I have read and I am assuming he didn't get a Nobel prize for nothing.... ...but at times, I was really struggling with this book (some historical parts, comparison of Turkish writers and other overly detailed info). It definitely had some great parts and I enjoyed the photographs. So I'd say 3,5 stars.. I strongly believe you will enjoy this book only if you are either going to Istanbul or you have already been. I was reading it while I was there and I finished it when I came home. Therefore, many of these things were familiar and I knew what he was talking about. Otherwise, I'd say maybe rather give a chance to some other books by the author.","Jan 12, 2018"
11312115,Sanket,"Istanbul dives into the rich history of one of the greatest cities in the world, but through the tear stained memoir glasses of Orhan Pamuk. However through exploring his own memories , personal and otherwise, he doesn't fall into a completely nostalgic view of the Ottoman Empire. There is much sadness in the way he positions all of Istanbul's problem without hinting at any clear solution.. The book ebbs and flows as Pamuk, a painter also, plays with his brushstrokes and brings out a largely readable and enjoyable book.. In Istanbul there is also a larger message for the whole world. While change is essential in the world and there are issues in the world that needs to be tackled. Yet something are also worth preserving. As a human race our future lies in how we make that distinction.","Nov 15, 2018"
68212498,Maud (reading the world challenge),"[#50 Turkey]. I was slightly disappointed by this read, probably because it was not what I expected. The first part focuses on the author's family's everyday life and drags on, I couldn't wait to start exploring more of the city. The second part mixes in a more clever way the author and the city's lives.. Pamuk's painting of Istanbul is grey and sad, which doesn't fit to the image we have from an occidental point of view. The book almost made me nostalgic about a place I never set foot in.. It caught my attention in a particular way as a French reader, because we follow in their Turkish peregrinations authors such as Gustave Flaubert, Théophile Gautier and Gérard de Nerval.","May 31, 2017"
38067703,Nataly Romaniv,"I started the book a month before my trip to Istanbul and finished it a month after it. I don’t know why it took me so long. Maybe it was my mind busy with a lot of other staff. Or the monotony of the nostalgic story. But I definitely enjoyed the atmosphere of this autobiographical novel and the history of it’s main character - Istanbul. I suppose it will be interesting to read some of the other Pamuk’s novels after getting to know so much about his youth, life views and background. One thing I can say for sure: I’m not going to reread this book, but I’m definitely going to come back to the city of Istanbul.","Oct 31, 2017"
2778238,Savil Srivastava,"There are many ways to describe this book: An autobiographical story of how Orhan Pamuk came to be a writer. A love-story to the city he grew up in, and draws inspiration from. A history of 19th and 20th century Istanbul.. Its meandering, and long, and will probably infuriate many readers who may well give it 2-stars as a rating. Most will not bother finishing it. But it makes up for all that by periods of beautiful narration about Istanbul, both personal and historical. The chapter on the hüzün (poorly translated as melancholy) of Istanbul is alone worth the hardcover price. May every city have such an account of its history.","Jul 20, 2018"
90507383,Mahin,"Quite a few of my friends raved about Pamuk's Istanbul a while ago - and as I'm studying Turkish - I wanted to learn more about that wonderful city on the Bosphorus. Istanbul, once the heart of the Ottoman Empire, is a unique city, bridging East and West. Istanbul, the book, is in part a memoir and a loose historical account of the city. In general, most English-language literature related to Turkey is from a Western perspective so Pamuk's perspective as an Istanbullu is interesting, though inevitably discusses the effect of the Western (well, French) gaze on Istanbul and her citizens. For example, Pamuk recounts instances where westerners innocuously remark on some quaint Turkish tradition/activity/etc only for the Istanbullus to immediately eliminate that very thing/activity. With respect to the author, I found his anecdotes about his early life and upbringing interesting though obviously not representative of the lives of most Istanbullus, being circumscribed by class.","Mar 14, 2019"
1443421,Michael Jay,"Such a strong finish from a great, wandering journey, with familiar footpaths and rhythms from when I was visiting the city myself, and living an hour's flight away. Pamuk has a fine touch, as the cotton representing his family name lends to how he knits together his story. March 18th is a Victory Day of memory for Çanakkale, and a fitting date for me to revisit a countryman's story about life after victories and after struggles, and after a realization of purpose amidst the hüzün, the melancholy, which has a familiar echo to many a reader, from any place she or he has had to stand outside the self to recreate it. Well done Orhan Bey.","Mar 18, 2019"
94773766,Annisa Saraswati,"It’s always been difficult for me to enjoy Orhan’s novels. I’ve been wondering the reason behind this, for his novels depict various conflicts, histories, cultures of Turkey in details; something that normally gives sparks to me. As I kept on reading this book, I could relate to his despair and yet it influenced me to feel gloomy as well. I, then, realize that his depressing theme doesn’t suit my interest. Not to mention that he overuses the word melancholy, or at some point he mention hüzür as well. His details to me were somehow unnecessary. Sometimes the chapters could be personal but the others are like facts from historical books; distant and cold.","Mar 31, 2019"

31376917,Lukrezia Cosimo,"I loved this book for the sense of melancholy, the ""hüzün"", for the evocative images of an Istanbul that is disappearing or has already gone. Pamuk's descriptions of buildings, boats, the poorer areas, the café houses, the street sellers, the fishermen all conjure up a city that is full of life and noise, even if there is often an uneasy feeling of loss and sadness. The book would have been incomplete without the wonderful photographs, mainly by Ara Güler. Some of them were much too small. I found myself poring over them, trying to work out every little detail.","Jun 03, 2018"
8162369,Juhi,"Orhan Pamuk tells the story of his life and the story of the city Istanbul in this book. It focuses more on the city now or in the post Ottoman times. In the middle i felt, he was going more details of his life than the city but the way he brings it together in the end is beautiful. You connect with him and the city.. Being from a city (Delhi) which was great at one time and where also people live among ruins and the skyscrapers from the New Delhi, I could connect his story. I wanted to read a book based in Istanbul to prepare for my trip to Istanbul. I will update the review after my trip.","Aug 27, 2018"

Later, reading books set in Turkey/Istanbul made me add this book on ""to read"" list.. This is a nice prose on old beautiful ""hüzün"" Istanbul. The book itself is an experience.

5884312,T P Kennedy,"A beautifully presented book enchanted with some great photography. If this was shorter and less indulgent it could have been a super book. As a look at a once imperial and declining city told seen through an autobiographical lens it broadly succeeds. The author cannot resist long detours to explore some of the writing about the city which has little resonance to a non Turkish reader. The focus on melancholy becomes a little grating as the book advances - it seems characterised by a single state of being. Interesting, nonetheless.","Jan 30, 2020"
16133037,Gerardine,"A rich, tapestried memoir, redolent with the smells, sights, and sounds of the author's home city on the Bosphorus, it is illustrated with many of the dark engravings of Antoine Melling. In his memory the author sees his troubled parents' marriage, the cypresses of Istanbul, the dark woods, the weathered old ships, and the decaying mansions as a confirmation of his own melancholy. The language and imagery is so rich and layered that you almost wish for one plain Jane Austen sentence. This memoir is worth two or three readings, and I shall certainly return to it.. .","Jul 07, 2020"

He never glorifies history from its events and impacts. Somehow I could resonate his perspective on life, people, the past. I truly was so taken back by how familiar he felt. It wasn't until the very end that I found out his career was actually what I was pursuing. It made me feel like I was destined to pick up this book, it was the world assuring me for the direction I was headed. What a wonderful concept to find in a book.","Jul 14, 2020"

Orhan's is not the glamorous Istambul of the travel guides, but destitute and agitated former capital of the Ottomans.

I admire and revered his profound connections with his city. I was wondering how could Pamuk remember so much from his childhood and be extraordinarily frank with details, including his sexual fantasies. I didn't expect Pamuk himself would tell us in a passage point-blank that even he didn't dismiss the doubt that memories might just be invented.","Apr 14, 2018"

He was born in the city during the 1950s and still lives there (2004) in the home where he was born and raised. Orhan Pamuk has witnessed many changes in the city through the years, yet to him some things remain constant.

In this collection of reflections by Orhan Pamuk, these two genres catch up in a melancholic beautiful manner like long-lost yet reunited lovers, who nevertheless have no ""happily ever after"" in sight.

69642512,Mariam,"🌟🌟🌟🌟 out of five. A brilliant depiction of the city, it is as if Pamuk is in a dialogue with a friend. He sees the city and through that, he turns these images into his own vocation, and he reflects the essence of his life through these images that he captures perfectly and refinement-ly via words. What a wordsmith, a literary architect if you will. A memoir of his life and of the city's no less, for it is not a geographical patch of ground is not a guest in his life story, but it is his life.","Jul 06, 2020"
84367870,Ishmamul Hoque Sadab,"Orhan Pamuk followed a very exquisite approach to bring before us the history and socioeconomic aspect of the then Istanbul by inter wining with it his childhood and adolescence. The book not only holds some important phase in the life of the writer but also is a vivid image of Istanbul,its people,the mindset of its people and the above all the melancholy associated with it.. Although I got stuck at some point while reading,it was a good read.","Jul 07, 2020"
14015282,Tiffany,"A masterful writer, one of my favorites! I started this book 5 years ago...in Istanbul, but put it down because I was too absorb in the real magic of Istanbul right in front of my eyes! What a treat to pick it up, start over and finish this mesmerizing memoir that brings the sights, sounds, smells and awe of this incredible city right back to my memory as well.","Aug 27, 2018"
86614965,Youssouf,"I read the french version but I found the book without substance. What I learned was how Istanbul looked like in the 60' and 70' with hundreds of black and white pictures of the city, the life of the wealth family...What I learned is about the way the author sees drawing and the second dimension ""world?"" that it brings us closer to.","Mar 25, 2019"
78396865,Shannon,"Did not finish this - could not relate to the narrator at all, in fact he really annoyed me. Other books recounting people's pasts I generally find quite interesting but this narrator seemed infuriatingly out of touch with anything I could connect with. Made it about a quarter of the way through the book before giving up.","Jul 20, 2019"
21809453,Ananta Pathak,"A delightful read from the Master. A homage to a city that Pamuk is in love with or at ease. Here is a book which describes a city unlike others, going into the soul of the city as a wanderer, as a lover. Finally I read the book that i was hoping to read for a long time and I am thrilled to have read it finally.","Aug 06, 2019"
32153612,Yuri,"This is a gift of a book: part memoire, part travel guide, all deeply personal, all affecting. Pamuk here talks about hüzün a lot, which is a kind of communal melancholy Istanbul and Istanbullus feel in the shadow of their people's once-great empire, and yet this book is not so much sad as it is deeply appreciative.","Aug 10, 2019"
1865478,Elizabeth,"My own strongest memory of Istanbul is the smoky coal smell of it, as instantly recognizable and evocative as a perfume. The black and white pictures and the magnificent writing, in excellent translation, somehow convey this dusky smell, and with it the mystery and hüzün of Istanbul. I read it simultaneously with Aziz Nesin's memoir of growing up in Istanbul at the end of the Ottoman Empire. Despite the poverty of his upbringing, Nesin wrote with a lighter touch; Pamuk's writing is richer and sadder, but they weave together splendidly.. This is a book to return to again and again, like the city itself.","Aug 14, 2019"
4994143,Priyanka Karuvelil,"The beauty of hüzün and the language with which Pamuk weaves this ode to the city was a pleasure to read while wandering around Istanbul. Witty and wry by turns, while giving you an insider’s view into the Istanbul of past and present, this book is a masterful work by a great writer. A must read for anyone visiting the city!","Nov 28, 2019"
95467449,Gabriela Carr,"I read this during and after my first trip to Istanbul, and it was fascinating to hear his perspective on his beloved city, and how it has influenced him for his entire life. His writing can be somewhat too self indulgent for my taste, but nevertheless enjoyed this window into the soul of the city.","Jan 05, 2020"
62188192,Nadiya ,"It was not a naturally flowing engaging read as I was expecting. At times the content seemed overly repetitive and indiscriminately selected. At the same time, I did enjoy it. The book helped me to see Istanbul in a very different light, through the prism of „Hüsün“ (melancholy), on which the author dwelled so extensively :).","Jan 29, 2020"
3784314,Hamed,"Finally, I finished it. I cannot help admiring Pamuck's fascinating writing, and saying how brilliantly it was constructed. I could feel the melancholy beneath Istanbul. I could smell the smoke from Bosphorus. It was great.. But the translation was disappointing. I wish I could read Turkish. My rating goes to the translation!","Mar 03, 2020"
40470028,Aylin Alpustun,"Would you believe it if I told you that it took me three years to finish this book? I started reading and then put it away maybe five times...always determined to get to the last word of the last sentence ..... It coincided with the Covid19 lockdown... so just imagine the spirit I was in.. Without a doubt reading Pamuk is a huge challenge for me as he is simply brilliant.. In this book he just seems to be rambling away and it felt as if I was being tossed from one corner of his brain to the other.. Did I attain exactly what I was hoping to earn? Yes and no.. This is a memoir written by a nobel prize winner in literature so I should not have been in pursuit of an architectural insight of Istanbul. But I was because he is an architect by training.. This is Istanbul through the eyes of foreign arts people such as Melling, Nerval, Gautier and de Amicis as well as the Turkish like Beyatlı, Koçu, AŞ Hisar and Tanpınar.. Yet it offers an İstanbul which is full of gloom, melancholy, defeat and low-spirits which is not how I see the magical city I live in.. Well, finaly, am I glad I read it? Yes. Do I recommend it ? Yes","Apr 16, 2020"
70140816,Ross Craig,"It's beautiful but at times it feels like the city he's describing - too large in scope to ever be truly captured and summed up..

27678334,Eric,"A joyful listen, even though it is difficult to determine whether to call it a memoir or a travelog or even a lament - it has elements of all three. Whether Pamuk wished to be an artist or an architect, he turned out to be a pretty fair writer.","Oct 10, 2018"

6743601,Jim Fonseca,"One of Pamuk’s first novels. First a sample of some of the wonderful writing from the very first page:. “Ruya was lying facedown on the bed, lost to the sweet warm darkness beneath the billowing folds of the blue-checked quilt. The first sounds of a winter morning seeped in from outside: the rumble of a passing car, the clatter of an old bus, the rattle of copper kettles that the salep maker shared with the pastry cook, the whistle of the parking attendant at the dolmus stop. A cold leaden light filtered through the dark blue curtains. Languid with sleep, Galip gazed at his wife’s head: Ruya’s chin was nestling in the down pillow. The wondrous sights playing in her mind gave her an unearthly glow that pulled him toward her even as it suffused him with fear. Memory, Celal had once written in a column, is a garden. Ruya’s gardens, Ruya’s gardens… Galip thought. Don’t think, don’t think, it will make you jealous! But as he gazed at his wife’s forehead, he still let himself think.”. The story: There’s not a lot of plot. Galip is a lawyer in Istanbul. His wife Ruya has disappeared leaving him a brief note. He hides her leaving from his family. Did she go back to her first husband whom she was married to for just a few years? Or could she have run off with his uncle, Celal, a nationally famous newspaper columnist? Celal too has disappeared. Very little of the book is about the actual search; instead it’s the mental process Galip goes through of trying to figure out where she is, often using mystical clues he finds in Celal’s old columns. While searching for his wife, her ex-, and the columnist, Galip starts assuming the columnist’s identity, writing his columns, wearing his clothes, living in his secret apartment (he has enemies from the ideas he has expressed), imitating his voice when he answers his phone calls. One persistent called threatens his life.. Instead of a lot of plot, we get essays about life in Turkey and Turkish culture from numerous columns written by Celal and from conversations such as when a group of reporters sit around the table and tell stories.. There ae many themes in the book but I think first it is a love story. Galip grew up with Ruya (they are cousins) and he has loved her since he was a child.. Another theme is identity and people trying to “be themselves.” There’s an extended story about a legendary Turkish prince who was so obsessed with trying to be himself that he would destroy books that had brought the ideas of others into his head. There is some talk about Doubles, “where people were at once themselves and their own imitations.”. Many people in the story want to be someone else. Galip want to be Celal. Celal wants to be Rumi, a famous Persian poet. Galip runs into an old girlfriend from school days and finds out she is still in love with him and fantasizes that she is Ruya. A brothel that Galip visits specializes in women who look, act and speak like American movies stars.. There are a lot of references to American films and movie stars from the era of Edgar G. Robinson, Clark Gable, Ava Gardner, Elizabeth Taylor. In Turkey’s wave of Westernization even mannikins had to look European, not Turkish. The columnist writes about how Western films even changed Turkish gestures.. Of course, all this about ‘be yourself” is related to Turkish identity, Turkey being a country that deliberately tried to Westernize starting in the late 1880’s through Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in the 1920’s.. Among the mystical clues Galip uses, another theme is about reading letters in peoples’ faces tied in with the ancient Hurufism sect. Kind of like astrology. And maps: Maps of the city and mystical codes inscribed by someone’s journey or by tracing an ant crawling over a map on a page. And faces you discern by superimposing maps over each other, such as maps of Istanbul, Cairo and Damascus. (And what are the odds of this: a novel I reviewed two weeks ago, The Tango Singer by Tomas Eloy Martinez, also talked about the main character looking for secret clues on a map of where a singer spontaneously performed in Buenos Aires.). And it’s almost always snowing. Is that a theme? Perhaps Pamuk got the idea of writing his novel Snow after writing this book. It's also a love story to the city of Istanbul: it's beauty as well as its seediness.. I really enjoyed this book and the depth of thought on a wide variety of topics. Pamuk won the Nobel Prize in 2006. It’s a long book. The edition I read had a tiny font and hardly any margins and went for almost 500 pages; other editions in English are 700 or even 800 pages long, so it is an extensive read that can be a bit trying in places but generally I never felt it was getting repetitive or losing focus. I give it a 5 and I’m adding it to my favorites.. Photos of Istanbul: top from cloudfront.net; middle from wendyperrin.com; bottom from gettyimages.com.

The setting Istanbul, Turkey, the largest city in the nation, straddling the bright blue waters of the narrow , and rather shallow , but still even today quite .... crucial Bosphorus Strait, on both the continents of. Asia and Europe . This is the ultimate problem for its divided people, do we become westernized or remain with traditional, old customs ... They go see ancient Hollywood films, some 20 years old, at the movie theaters, ( no television then ) enamored by the stars, copy what is shown, clothes, manners, language, everything, the values from the past are no more . Galip Bey, mid -thirty, is an uninspired lawyer (not happy in the occupation), in his native, fast growing town, married to the beauty Ruya, a woman of the same age, he has known since childhood. Intelligent with a propensity for reading detective books, one after another, not interested in work, lately him too. His famous older cousin by more than twenty years Celal Bey, a newspaper writer with a column that all the city reads, in fact the whole nation and beyond the borders, he is the most read in the Middle East..No surprise that Galip is a big admirer of his relative's sophisticated writing, has many enemies, though, dabbles in dangerous politics , he is also Ruya's half-brother. Turmoil consumes the people's daily lives there, political violence and killings in the streets, many urge a military coup to cleanse the atmosphere, bring unity and calm back ... circa 1960. Mysteriously Ruya leaves him, later Celal cannot be found either, have they run off together? Then begins the long search by the husband to discover where they are hiding. A ""Heart of Darkness"" voyage on land , as he walks through ominously deserted streets , lights fade in sunless places, shadows fall on filthy , evil smelling slums... observing apartments that are ready to collapse, citizens struggling to survive the ever expanding, choatic megalopolis , its rapidly changing environment, the poor begging and stealing, death lurks by, but nobody cares . Galip has a feeling, a strange disturbing belief... he is not alone , someone is following, an evil eye, yet the threat is dismissed ... must go on, what occurs good or bad will happen , the dispirited man has to know the truth. He continues the seemingly fruitless odyssey..A strange trip into Turkish history and the crisis in that magnificent country, what is its destiny? A book that both entertains and causes boredom to the reader, if a person wants to find the real Turkey, this is the book, but be patient, the story will delight and frustrate, the plot is not really important... the philosophy is. The author's love hate relationship with a city he was born in, is apparent.","Aug 07, 2017"
54697,Matt,"this is a rare example of a reread for me. I don't reread books very often, not because I don't want to, blahblahblah..... My experience of reading this one was a good example of a certain kind of reader's disease. The kind where even though you are trying to focus your attention on the story, the language, etc your eyes start to water and you kind of glaze over in your mind, turning pages and sort of dimly registering the story. It's not ""reading"",per se, but it's not skimming either. It's not bullshitting your way through the book- it's more that when you read a lot your brain (or at least mine) kind of gets blurry when the story or the language doesn't exactly burst out at you.. I think it also makes a difference when the writer's particular style doesn't mesh well with your own individual brain chemistry. His way of seeing is somewhat at odds with yours. It's not a philosophical difference so much as its about...instincts of perception, if you will. The pacing of the story, the level of and type of detail, the way he describes a room or how much of it, the length and construction of sentences....all that kind of stuff. I don't think it's pretentious or posuer-ish to continue reading even if the writer's style means you're going to miss most of what's happening. Sometimes you can uncover a jewel even in the midst of confusion or mistakes. And besides, some people just *have* to finish a book once they start it. I'm one of them.. Also, consider the fact that many of the places where the modern reader reads are not particularly conducive to the intimate, erotic, spiritual practice of reading a book. Consider, just for starters, the din of airports, buses, commuter rails, subways, bars, restaurants, living rooms with the tv on, so on and so forth. There is usually a trickle of white noise coming in from at least one direction- there has got to be some of the magic drained out of the experience. I would venture that long, prolonged investments in concentration could be harder to come by now than ever. More comprehension gets shaved off while, ironically, the abundance and availability of material is richer than ever. And then there's the next hundred and seventy nine pages to go.... So...I kind of shortchanged the book a little bit.. I think it's excusable to sort of pass something like this off, as long as you did make a decent effort. Hell, not everything can be easy to understand, right? This is leisure reading, after all. I was not told there would be any math on this exam. I will not put my pencil down.. Anyway, apropos of nothing, I picked this up again recently and it's a whole new experience. The scales have fallen from my eyes. There are still some stumbling blocks here and there- Pamuk is a writer for whom I have great respect, and I absolutely loved ""The New Life""- but all in all the tale is beginning to fill in for me and I'm really participating in it in a way I hadn't before. It's funny, since so much of this very provocative, philosophically savvy, eerily clean novel has to do with preoccupations of identity. I deliberately phrased it like this because there's very strong self-reflexive aspect to the proceedings. The main character is trying to relocate his vanished wife through the medium of the collected newspaper columns of his cousin, her former husband, who has also vanished, who has written a great deal about the identity of Turkey in the (post) modern world, not to mention his own consciousness and psychic disorientation, and so obviously there's a deeply meta-narrative project in place. You can imagine how sticky and obfuscating this kind of thing gets when, for whatever reason, the co-ordinates of your consciousness aren't really aligned with the text. it's a delicate balancing act anyway, moreso when the author is stepping into some very seductive, Borgesian metaphysical landscapes.. Now I that, about three years later, I can dip back into it with pleasure and profit I am pleased to say that The Black Book, at maybe about 65% done at least, is a very, very worthwhile tome. It has the narrative of a noir: meditative, crisp, somewhat chilly and slightly spare. It has the political significance of Pamuk's status as a player on the Turkish literary scene (if you're actually reading this you should really acquaint yourself with his works and days) and especially when you consider the story's being set in 1980, the significance of this is explained rather neatly in Maureen Freeley's translator's afterward- a little too neatly, if you ask me. And, philosophically, it is very beautifully investigated, well prosed, and that's difficult to do well. Philosophy is an incredible thing. Sometimes its relationship to literature can be a bit awkward and bumbling. Sometimes it adds a moral and existential resonance to a story which is intriguing and enticing on its own merits. Pamuk handles this beautifully-. There's quite a few quotable gems here. Many of them go on at length, necessarily. Here are a few of the shorter ones:. ""He felt happy, on the verge of a revelation- the secret of life, the meaning of the world, shimmering just beyond his grasp- but when he tried to put this secret into words, all he could see was the face of the woman who was sitting in the corner watching him."". ""He surveyed the dome, the columns, the great stone structures above his head, longing to be moved but feeling stuck. There was the vaguest of premonitions...but this great edifice was as impenetrable as stone itself. It did not welcome a man in, nor did it transport him to a better place. But if nothing signified nothing, than anything could signify anything. For a moment he thought he saw the flash of blue light, and then he heard the flutter of what sounded like the wings of a pigeon, but then he returned to his old stagnant silence, waiting for the illumination that never came."". ""For what is reading but the animating of a writer's words on the silent film strip in our minds?"". There's some phenomenal set pieces, too. Paumk's Istanbul is there in its 'there-ness' but it still has a universal quality, albeit a somewhat dour, crystalline, noir-ish ambience.... It got three stars for a muddled, uncomprehending first read which was decidedly my fault and now it's getting four stars for coming off the bench and working nicely...","Feb 21, 2008"
900800,Inderjit Sanghera,"A post-modern masterpiece in the vein of the best of Calvino or Borges, ‘The Black Book’ is the novel in which Pamuk was able to force his literary star and create a work of art luminosity blazed forth and heralded a new star of Turkish literature; Kemal had poetry, but Pamuk has something even more important-originality.. The dominant themes in the novel are ones which often recur in Pamuk’s novels; identity, Westernisation and Istanbul, combined with a sense of playfulness and erudition. Let’s start with Istanbul. Few other novelists have imbued the cities in which the stories are set with such importance; in ‘The Black Book’, Pamuk paints Istanbul is a dull, dolorous monochrome, a city of constant snowfalls, of darkness and deceit, a city in which a web of conspiracies and conflagrations. This stands in stark contrast to the bright incandescence with which Istanbul is normally depicted, but is important it establishing the mental state of the narrator, Galip. Galip labours through a series of identity crises throughout the novel; he spends most his time searching for his cousin, the newspaper journalist Celal, who feels may (or may not have) run away with his wife, Rüya. Pamuk references Proust-specifically Marcel’s obsession with Albertine-on several occasions throughout the novel and Galip’s search for Rüya, his fixation with her perceived unfaithfulness and the unreliable depiction of her character all parody Marcel’s search for Albertine following her death. Another source of parody for Pamuk is the genre of detective fiction-as the narrator states. “Galip had once told Rüya that the only detective book he’d ever want to read would be the one in which not even the author knew the murderer’s identity. Instead of decorating the story with clues and red herrings, the author would be forced to come to grips with his characters and his subject, and his characters would have a chance to become people in a book instead of just figments of their author’s imagination.”. Clues constantly serve as red herrings and inconsequential events or people suddenly become vitally important-or not important at all-instead the conventions of detective fiction; the femme fatale and the cuckolded husband are turned on their heads-the reader is unsure as to whether it is Galip searching for Celal or Celal searching for Galip, or how much of the novel is a figment of Galip’s imagination or, more to the point, how aware Galip is that he is just a figment of another’s imagination, the author, who makes a late appearance (or does he?) in the novel. Is it the realisation of this which is at the core of Galip’s struggle with his identity, or is it the gradual coalescene of Galip with Celal, until Galip begins writing Celal’s stories and have conversations with malevolent mad-men as Celal? This uncertainty creates a sense of unreliability throughout the narration, as reality and fantasy merge to become virtually indistinguishable, in fact, given that the whole thing is a work of fiction, is what is real even relevant?. Pamuk further explores post-modern concepts and techniques via Celal’s newspaper articles which are interspersed throughout the novel. At times it feels like the articles are long drawn at clues which will allow Galip to find Celal, however this may be more a product of Galip’s warped mindset and self-obsession-the articles themselves are the high-points of the novel. Celal rails against plagiarism, yet many of his articles are plagiarised from other novels-for example, the pastiche of the ‘Grand Inquisitor’ chapter from ‘The Brothers Karamazov’. He is critical of imperialism, yet his articles perpetuate negative Western attitudes to the orient-like the narrator Galip, Celal’s articles are unreliable and duplicitous , yet are off-set with a lyrical verve which draws the reader in, as they are gradually ensconced within the wonderful web of deceit and uncertainty which Pamuk weaves across the novel.","Dec 03, 2017"
285596,John,"I hope that Orhan Pamuk really enjoyed writing The Black Book, because I definitely did not enjoy reading it.. It is ostensibly the story of Celal, a columnist for a major Turkish daily who has disappeared or ran away, told through the eyes of the his friend and brother-in-law, Galip. When Galip’s pulp detective novel-loving wife (Celal’s sister) disappears as well, Galip turns into something of a detective himself, and the plot thickens. And then, it slows to a tedious crawl.. Whatever the story is here, it becomes something of an afterthought, taking a back seat to page after page of postmodern quasi-philosophical musings on the nature of identity. The plot pulls its head up out of the ground from time to time, introducing a few new twists and intrigues which, were they part of a tighter, more focused novel may actually have been interesting, perhaps even thrilling. But as it was they just ended up getting lost in the larger symphony of postmodern tangents whose meaning or purpose in this novel I almost certainly did not fully understand. Man, this was a tough slog of a read.. With all that being said, though, now that some time has elapsed since I read it last year, I can look back with the sugar-coated spectacles of hindsight and identify some things about it that I eventually came to appreciate, such as the portraits of some of the quirky minor characters, and the overall structure of the novel, which is punctuated with the columns of the missing columnist, columns which are eventually ghost-written by Galip, who takes up the pen when he realizes Celal will not return.. I also enjoyed some of the descriptive atmospheric passages about Istanbul, where Pamuk sort-of poetically depicts the various neighborhoods his protagnist travels through, from the seedy and worn to the posh and comfortable. There are also some pretty memorable passages from Celal’s columns, including a little fantasia about what lies at the bottom of the Bosporus, a passage that ended up being one of the most memorable of the entire novel.. I read this book during a trip to Turkey (yes, I was one of *those* people), which included a few days in Istanbul, and something about being in the place where a novel is set does add something meaningful to the experience, even if it is an excruciating one at the time.","Nov 06, 2007"
214053,Adam,"A man’s search for his wife and her journalist ex-husband becomes intertwined with the latter’s bizarre articles/columns turning this book into a bewildering hall of mirrors of Dostoevsky styled feverish monologues, storytelling sessions like a Dinesen or Potocki tale, and Borgesian labyrinths of history and literature (and fake detective tale). Each chapter is its own unit; a short story, mock essay, or monologue. This book is exasperating, annoying, thrilling, and provocative at different points and the landscape of Pamuk’s Istanbul is world of threatening phone calls, gangsters, wise journalists, eschatological hints, melancholy, shadowy doubles and disguises, an underground chamber of mannequins, crows, and flickering identity; a gothic and alluring epic labyrinth or inferno.","Mar 06, 2008"
1415047,Whitaker,"*Available from. KOBOBOOKS. The book, in a nutshell, traces the protagonist’s search for his wife and, subsequently, also his cousin. There is indeed a vague plot resembling a detective novel here, but that is hardly the point of the novel. The real point of the novel is Turkey, as Galip’s search for Ruya takes him around Istanbul meeting various people who he thinks might help him find her, and via this process the novel morphs into an examination of identity, both individual and national.. On one level, Pamuk reflects on the Turkish dilemma of being caught between Asia and Europe, of how to be both modern/secular without becoming purely a poor copy of the West. On another level, Pamuk reflects on what it means to be oneself, delving into Ottoman culture and sufi beliefs to mull on this question.. You will note that I have avoided stating that Pamuk answers these questions or proffers any solutions to them. The novel often appears to approach an answer only for readers to find that answer taken away from them. In her Afterword to this edition of the novel, its translator, Maureen Freely, states, “The poet Murat Nemet-Nejat has described Turkish as a language that can evoke a thought unfolding.” This seems to describe Pamuk’s approach here as well: the novel is, or becomes, an exploration of Galip’s (and Pamuk’s) evolution of thought towards an ever receding conclusion, brought only to an artificial end by the end of the book.. The other aspect of the novel that so enchanted and struck me was its references to Turkish history and literature. Pamuk discusses this in. an interview with the Paris Review. :. “I went with my wife to the United States in 1985, and there I first encountered the prominence and the immense richness of American culture. As a Turk coming from the Middle East, trying to establish himself as an author, I felt intimidated. So I regressed, went back to my ‘roots’. I realized that my generation had to invent a modern national literature… I had to begin by making a strong distinction between the religious and literary connotations of Islamic literature, so that I could easily appropriate its wealth of games, gimmicks, and parables. Turkey had a sophisticated tradition of highly refined ornamental literature… There are lots of allegories that repeat themselves in the various oral storytelling traditions—of China, India, Persia. I decided to use them and set them in contemporary Istanbul… So I set all these rewritten stories in Istanbul, added a detective plot, and out came. The Black Book. . But at its source was the full strength of American culture…”. It is this state of interstitiality, of in-betweeness that I find most compelling and interesting about this work: the drawing from the richness of the well of Turkish culture without being slavish to tradition nor betraying it all the while trying to interpret it in a way that speaks authentically to the contemporary state so embedded in a culture/technology that is inherently Anglo-Saxon/American.","Mar 11, 2014"
8111258,Deea,"To what degree can we be ourselves?. “To be or not to be oneself”. , considers Pamuk, is life’s ultimate question. A roller-coaster which is alike in many aspects with a detective novel, this story is suffused with possible answers to the question above and explorations of how, only by telling stories, a man can really be himself. Through hypotheses developed in stories with a prince embarking on quests of finding his real self in order to be able to guide his people if he would come next in line to the throne, with an executioner who feels remorse after beheading a certain individual who expresses regret for his life differently than others, with an eye which can follow you anywhere you go, with stories about Rumi and Shams of Tabriz and inherently about Sufis, with stories about people who can read letters on faces, Pamuk immerses the reader in a metaphysical ride, touching with great charm aspects like history, mysticism, differences between East and West, family relations and love.. Although I discovered touches of brilliancy in this book and ideas that kept me pondering, I constantly had the feeling that I was missing out on things, that some meanings were eluding me because of the translation or maybe because of the fact that I am not so familiar with Turkish culture. Some things didn’t add up, some loose ends kept me wondering if I should give this story 5 stars or 4 or 3. There were paragraphs which really resonated with me and I felt elated while reading them, paragraphs which made me think that I would definitely rate this book 5 stars and paragraphs which annoyed me because I could not see their sense. However, maybe this is Pamuk’s way of introducing his readers to a Turkish atmosphere throughout the book: a blend of historical and cultural influences, either different because of the spatial component (influences from Western cultures which people adopt from movies, Western writers, singers and tourists) or because of the temporal component (every aspect from Turkey’s history meant adopting a different influence, depending on the countries they conquered or they only came in contact with: Istanbul, for instance, is a blend of civilizations and its names over time can say many things about the idea I pointed above: Byzantium, Constantinople, Asitane (The Doorstep), New Rome, Stamboul etc. The fragment below is, in my opinion, expressing in a condensed and elegant fashion what I wanted to point above:. “When he stepped onto Ataturk Bridge, Galip had resolved to look only at faces. Watching each face brighten at his gaze, he could almost see question marks bubbling from their heads – the way they did in the Turkish versions of Spanish and Italian photo novels – but they vanished in the air without leaving a trace. Gazing across the bridge at the skyline, he thought he saw each and every one of their faces shimmering behind its dull gray veil, but this too was an illusion. It was perhaps possible to look into the faces of his fellow citizens and see in them the city’s long history – its misfortunes, its lost magnificence, its melancholy and pain – but these were not carefully arranged clues pointing to a secret world; they came from a shared defeat, a shared history, a shared shame. As they churned across the gray-blue waters of the Golden Horn, they left a trail of ugly brown bubbles in their wake.”. I loved the story about Alladdin and his shop and I loved the fragment about Galip’s love for Ruya (the two of them, although they were married, living together in the same outer reality, had minds and imaginations which inhabited different realms). I loved the ideas in this book, but didn’t quite like the story. I actually found it a bit absurd, although I am sure that the idea Pamuk wanted to express prevailed and the story was only used as a means of revealing what he wanted. I understood that Galip assumed Celal’s identity and that he embarked on a spiritual quest which helped him find himself rather than his missing wife or his uncle. The ending seemed however far-fetched and only able to dignify a soap-opera. Putting aside the spiritual journey, at a factual level the pursuit Galip embarks upon throughout the novel is destined to find Celal, rather than Ruya. The way she ends up being found and her supposed actions during her absence are rather secondary next to Celal’s, while Pamuk wants us to believe his hero is looking for her, rather than Celal. A flawed novel I would say, but an enticing one. Plus, I cannot help but wonder, weren’t these flaws there on purpose used by Pamuk for a certain effect? The fragment below would seem to say so.. “If every letter in every face had a hidden meaning and if each signified a concept, it followed that every word composed of those letters must also carry a second hidden meaning (…). The same could be said of sentences and paragraphs – in short all written text carried second, hidden meanings. But if one bore in mind that these meanings could be expressed in other sentences or other words…, one could, through interpretation, glean a third meaning from the second, and a fourth from the third, ad infinitum – so there were, in fact, an infinite numbers of possible interpretations to any given text. It was like an unending maze of city streets, with each street leading to another: maps resembling human faces. So a reader who set out to solve the mystery in his own way, following his own logic, was no different from a traveler who finds the mystery of a city slowly unfurling before him as he wanders through streets on that map: The more he discovers, the more the mystery spreads; the more the mystery spreads, the more is revealed and the more clearly he sees the mystery in the streets he himself has chosen, the roads he’s walked down and the alleys he’s walked up; for the mystery resides in his own journey, his own life.”","Jan 22, 2015"

5204784,Vonia,"I get it. Not all authors write in the same style, the same proficiency, the same genre, nor the same level of whatever readers want in each of their books. That is why there are novels that are more successful than others within their work. Perhaps, therefore, there should be no real sympathy for me here, but Orhan Pamuk's The Museum of Innocence was by far one of my all-time-favorites, a definite 5 Star. Sadly, I have read the more if guys works, increasingly desperately trying to find one that is even clear to such greatness; the closest has been a pathetic 3.5 Stars. Le sigh. Although I hate to admit it, finding another work from Pamuk very similar in personal preference to The Museum of Innocence will be difficult, since I have noticed that it is the least politically centered. It is there if choose, asking with his Turkish background, cultural notes, etceteras, that has become guys trademark, but starkly less so. More so, it focuses far more on psychological and physiological ideas, romance and true love. Which I obviously have a weakness for. Accepting but not quite accepting this, we shall move on to The Black Book. Honestly, my least favorite from Oamuk so far. Almost completely revolving around politics, which were honestly confusing for me to fully comprehend.. The main characters. Galip, the narrator. Ruya, his wife whom disappears early on in the story, never outweighing the reader with her voice. Celal, her brother, a famous political newspaper columnist, who secretly suffers from an undefined memory disorder. Other notable characters include thorities trying to find Celal, as well as a devoted reader, stalkerishly knowledgeable regarding the intimate miniature and nuances in Celal's life; possibly violent and trying to locate Celal whom had disappeared asking with Ruya. This this man is actually speaking to Galip, whom becomes an extremely unreliable narrator as he puts himself into Celal's shoes. Literally. He soon send to even forget which is the real him, what is real and what is a dream or his imagination. Along with the reader.. The focus of this novel ends up being identity. For example, everything we do is essentially an imitation of someone else, something else- whether a fictional character, sometime we know, someone we do not. Who is, of course, imitating someone else or something else. And so on. A barber asked Celal a couple questions that changed his life and therefore play an important part in the story: ""Do you have trouble being yourself?""; "" Is there a way a man can be only himself?"" The answer- at least according to The Black Book- is ""No"".. The chapters in this book alternate between Celal's columns and the story presently taking place with Galip searching for him and his wife Ruya. I far preferred the columns, as they were beautifully and lyrically written, straightforward with none of the mystical confusion found in the other chapters, with far more interesting content.. My favorite was the one titled, ""Alaaddin's Shop"", which tells the shopkeeper's story; his older-than-time store that sells everything from rare toys to old comics, chocolate bars to pink backgammon dice, pencil sharpeners shaped like Dutch Windwills to archived newspapers, sexology annuals to prayer books. Being the only fully stocked marketplace in his town for so many years, Alaaddin certainly has much to tell.. My second favorite column was that which told the story of a young Prince Enfendi. He was so enamored with the idea of staying true to oneself that he dedicated his entire life to it. Alas, this is a very difficult thing to do. Impossible if you were to take it literally. The Prince hope to live without any influence from anyone. He threw away all the books he had so as to not be influenced by greater minds. He no longer meet with anyone he had an affinity for, to avoid influence. He hired servants to extinguish all unique scents within his vicinity for fear of eliciting nostalgic memories. He began to see woman whom he specifically disliked, so he could not be influenced by his desire to fulfill her desires. Unfortunately, he found himself caring more than ever for these women, as they were his only link to the outside world. Prince Enfendi was left with nothing but his devoted scribe, who transcribed his dying words.","Oct 26, 2015"
236411,Steve,"Remember those Magic Eye pictures that were popular back in the 90’s? If you stared at what looked like random dots or patterns in just the right way, forcing your eyes apart from their usual angled focus, a hidden 3-D image would suddenly pop into view. Some of them were pretty cool. If you were like me, though, it took a while to get it right. I remember moving the picture back and forth, commanding my eyes not to cross as it got closer to my nose and trying to hold that same angle as I moved it back out. Finally, it worked. The hidden fish (or whatever it was) came into focus, like it was floating off the page.. I kept thinking. The Black Book. might amount to the same thing. If I could just train my view a certain way, the hidden meaning would emerge. I tried all the harder because the protagonist, Galip, seemed to be doing the same thing. Only he was looking into a mirror. You see, Galip was suffering an identity crisis. It was easy to understand why. His wife, Ruya, disappeared one day with only a short note to explain herself. At the same time her half-brother, Celal, a celebrated columnist in Istanbul, went missing as well, presumably with her. Celal was Galip’s older cousin, a man he greatly admired. Galip’s own life as a lawyer was colorless compared to Celal’s. As a writer, Celal was acclaimed by his many readers for his allegories and mystical tales about Turkey’s cultural identity. But why would the two of them go off without him? How does the view Galip has of himself change in light of this? He spends most of the rest of the book trying to find them, but also trying to find his true self. If anything, though, he begins to see himself through Celal’s lenses.. The book is educational. It’s also structured in an interesting way, alternating chapters that are first an omniscient narrator’s account centering on Galip and then columns written by Celal. Then there was a convergence of sorts near the end that I won’t go into for fear of spoiling things.. Even a poor student of history (like me) can appreciate the parallels between personal and national identity that played out in this book. It was set in the early 80’s and was, in a way, a debate about East vs. West, old ways vs.new, and maybe Islam vs. Hollywood. Istanbul, I’m guessing, was as conflicted a place as any when it came to these opposites. They were still sorting out Ataturk’s march towards modernity.. Unfortunately, my search for the magic focus got to be tedious. The book was dense with descriptions that might appeal to anyone who has visited Istanbul, but probably won’t to those who haven’t. The main points seemed belabored, too. I’m not saying it should have been Twitterized, but a good editor might have found 100 pages to cut. Plus, once I did see the picture (if I truly did), its impact underwhelmed me. Assuming I understood the premise, to know or become your true self requires isolation from any outside influences. But then what could you draw on to form your eclectic self? Do closed societies with closed minds achieve a compensating inner purity? As my dysphemistic way of phrasing the question already suggests, I’m doubtful.","Jun 29, 2010"

269132,Nick,"This book should have been better. It had a very good beginning but then really fell off.. The fault is most likely both Pamuk’s and Freely’s (the translator). The way Freely described the translation process in the Afterword (which should have been the Foreword, unlike most Forewords, which give away the entire plot and should be Afterwords), it seems as if Turkish is incredibly hard to translate into English. She also relates how beautiful Pamuk’s prose is. That beauty does not come through. Instead, his writing seems overly verbose and his ideas, pseudo-significant. I wonder how much I would have enjoyed the novel if the translation were better (unfortunately, this is apparently a new translation, “improving” on a translation from the 90’s!). You get the feeling that Pamuk is a graphomaniac—he seems much more interested in writing itself than in writing about anything. This is a common disease amongst contemporary writers—all smart, no heart. It doesn’t help that the genre is “deconstructionist detective fiction” from the 1980’s. It’s not as bad as “City of Ass” by Mr. I’m P. Auster, but the ending is almost as unsatisfying. It’s also completely ironic that a novel about the life-affirming nature of story-telling can lack all of those pieces that make a story worth reading. For instance, I never cared about any of the characters. They never seemed to act like human beings; their motivations and reactions just seemed false, the product of a writer who writes characters just so they can talk about writing and the theme of “identity.” It’s almost doubly offensive because Pamuk puts the characters in situations which are highly emotional—in other words, he’s letting the situations alone force you, unnaturally, to feel things, rather than allowing characters that we care about to go through these dramatic situations and organically create emotions within the reader.. I think I would have been more forgiving of the book if it hadn’t been so long. The middle is so boring and repetitive that I most likely would not have finished the novel if I hadn’t been stuck in a room with nothing to do except read the one book I had brought with me. I literally believe you could skip the first 3/4 of part two and actually lose nothing (well, the chapter entitled “The Executioner and the Weeping Face” is worth reading). I also think that Maureen Freely could have cut every one of Pamuk’s sentences in half. The sentences just start avalanching you with useless detail. I don’t think I’ve ever read so much useless detail. Pynchon, for example, might throw a lot of strange details at you, but they’re not useless—they’re funny. Pamuk, or at least Pamuk in English, has no sense of humor whatsoever.. However, it’s not as if the book is totally without merit. Again, I liked the beginning of the book a lot! It had a great set up and you really thought he was going to take you somewhere special (the car ran out of gas). The conceit of chapters that alternated between the plot that the characters are living and the columns that the characters within the plot are reading was novel and refreshing; the stories within these columns were some of the best parts of the book. And if you’ve been to Istanbul, it’s fun to see all the different parts of the city pop up in various places. Yet this wasn't enough.. To sum up: this book is not the reason he won the Nobel Prize. Or at least, I hope not!","Aug 13, 2009"
1257629,Karl-O,"Who you really are? On the surface, this seems like a question already posed elsewhere with such banality and tedium that some would be happy to declare that they don’t care about the question, let alone a possible answer. However, you can’t help but to think about your identity while riding the roller-coaster that Pamuk manages to pull-off in The Black Book. Like all great minds, Pamuk knows very well that attempting to answer such a question is quite complicated, though he is committed to taking it seriously. He gives glimpses of different possible routes to tackle the question, including the compassionate view (for someone as lonely as himself) that it is impossible to live - as an individual or as a nation - in a meaningful way without trying to become somebody else.. My grandparents and their families hail from Diyarbakir in present day Turkey. In 1915, they fled their homes and found themselves in Syria due to massive deportation and massacres known collectively as The Armenian Genocide. I was born in Aleppo and hence had a sort of double connection to this book. First, my Armenian background with its extensive affinities and similarities to Turkish culture that goes both ways despite what the two archenemies will want you think. And second, through my childhood that was spent in Aleppo, a city that is to a great extent similar to Istanbul, in that though it has mainly an Islamic heritage, was and is home to people from different faiths and world-views. With its mosques, churches, narrow streets and bustling daily life, I was really thinking the book was talking a great deal about myself and where I come from. Though Aleppo is not torn between east and west like Istanbul, as an Armenian-Syrian reading this book, I couldn’t but see myself in it.. To return to the original question, the novel is constructed loosely as a detective fiction in which Galip, a middle aged lawyer, sets out in a journey to the streets and veins of Istanbul to find his detective-novel-loving wife, Ruya, who is also his cousin (an arrangement with a long history in Turkish and Islamic societies.) One night, Ruya leaves unexpectedly with a small note that doesn't mention where or why she is leaving. This quest for meaning guised as a search for his wife becomes a journey of self-discovery that echoes Pamuk’s question about Turkish identity. The tragic ending of the book is beautifully linked with the collective Turkish question, yet Pamuk doesn’t overstate the link. His is a personal journey as well that explores himself as an author by asking himself why, at all, he is writing? why is it that some choose to tell stories? is it the only thing that keeps them moving in their imaginary journeys?. The book is written in a charming format that alternates between the story of Galib’s search for his wife and columns written by his cousin Celal that he comes across. In each of these columns, Celal talks engagingly about his own life as a columnist, topics of historical, political and religious interest in addition to his complains about his supposed gradual loss of memory which symbolises Turkey’s troubled relationship with its own past. Having similar first names, Celal the columnist (with his very fluid personality) and Jalal el-Din Al Rumi (who is buried in Konya) enrich the pages of the novel that really unfolds like a great symphony. I will undoubtedly read this book more than twice.","Mar 17, 2014"
48483884,Michael Finocchiaro,"In this brilliant tour de force, Orhan Pamuk discusses language, writing, and the meaning of identity over a backdrop story of love and mystery. This being the 3rd book of his after having read My Name is Red and Snow, I am in awe of his story-telling agility. It is as beguiling as the stories inside of stories inside of stories inside 1001 Nights. I especially loved the famous ""When the Bosphorus Dried Up"" story and the one about the mural and the mirror. The history of Hurufism sent me to wikipedia for research into this arcane but fascinating splinter of Sufism. I will certainly be thinking of this book and its many meanings and messages for a long time to come. Very highly recommended.","Sep 19, 2016"
2881911,Farhan Khalid,"Memory. is a garden. The rain in his. dream. was the deepest blue. Nothing can ever be as shocking as life — Except writing. I remember, I remember so as not to forget!. These are the immortal. tales. I’ve always longed to tell. Rüya. seemed haunted by the joys and pleasures that had slipped beyond her grasp. Galip. still felt the terrible. eye. gazing down at him. Sighs rising and trembling through the timeless air. The life we live is someone else’s dream. There were young people who at certain times in their lives fell in love simply because of a word, a story, a book they’d both read. Everything that had ever been written, even the greatest and most authoritative texts in the world, were about dreams, not real life, dreams conjured up by words. Those who have not cracked the secret locked inside our. history. and our cemeteries cannot presume to speak about us. Go out into the street and look at people’s. faces. A song floated across the station, or perhaps from inside the restaurant, a song that spoke of love and grief and the emptiness of life. Sometimes snow fell, and sometimes darkness. Galip thought how much better it would be if he could leave this world behind forever and live in. Celâl’s. world instead. He has the same sort of life, the same sort of past, the same sort of memories. Adorn your stories with bittersweet recollections. Celâl’s hiding somewhere inside them. He’s always using his. column. to send. messages. to people, all sorts of people — small private messages. Life was an endless string of miseries, if one came to an end there was another waiting around the corner. This all-knowing, all-seeing eye was gazing down at me now without even trying to conceal itself. The eye knew me, and I knew the eye. It was I who created the eye, so that it could see me. If the eye didn’t see me, I would cease to exist at all. We all have a. second person. buried inside us, a dear friend to whom we whisper to our heart’s content. All these buildings, streets, and parks, all these houses laden with a lifetime of memories, reduced to a system of lines and points. Crowded collage of people, places, and images from my past. I saw myself and my entire life through His eyes. Everything that reminds me of you makes me unbearably sad. The only way forward was to rip away our memories, our past, our history. We should have met long ago. I am crazy about mysterious things. Instead of bringing them. hope. You’ve fed them lies. You yourself are. Deccal. His dreams flowing into the stories. Everything was a. copy. of something else. The writer spent his nights roaming the city’s dark alleys. The melancholy of the rainy streets of. Istanbul. I must be. myself. , I must be myself, I must be myself. All the people I’d had to see that day were still buzzing inside my head. Their words, their little noises, their endless stream of demands had blended into a single sound. So that midnight, I finally came to see how glad I was to live apart from that madding crowd, from the vile and muddy chaos into which everyone is always commanding me, commanding us all, to immerse ourselves. For once I was myself!. I must be myself, because if I failed to be myself, I became the person they wanted me to be. I was imitating the man who was nothing more than the sum total of all those people I was imitating. I look back on those days in search of solace, I am left only with the vague impression of a crowd moving through darkness. Our history could only survive. underground. Underground city ultimately wreaking revenge on the overground city. How short our lives are, how little we see, how little we know; so let us dream, at least. The words lost their meaning and turned into shapes. He wished he could remember her with another face, in another story. It was perhaps possible to look into the faces of his fellow citizens and see in them the city’s long history — its misfortunes, its lost magnificence, its melancholy and pain. They came from a shared defeat, a shared history, a shared shame. If he read Celâl’s columns over and over, he would gain access to Celâl’s memory, and once he had infiltrated Celâl’s memory, he would know where he was hiding. These people had been able to forget their own sadness by immersing themselves in a story. Story that gave meaning to their memories and their melancholy. Their sad dreams and sadder memories were fast fading from their minds. All murders are copies of other murders, just as all books are copies of other books. Creativity. rises out of anger, the kind of anger that erases all memory. I think of a troubled man pacing up and down the platform of a desolate station in the dead of night, waiting for a train that never comes. I shall roam about the city, searching for my beloved, searching for my very past behind every door I open. Every object, word, and meaning was now in its proper place, the deeper truth that held them all together was still beyond his reach. Somewhere between the lines, he had retreated into the shadows without anyone’s noticing and exchanged his identity. The moment arrived when the. search. itself became more important than the answer he’d come to seek. The searcher and the object of his desire changed places, where it was less important to reach a goal than to keep walking toward it. Celâl was obsessed with the little tricks, ambiguities, and fictions that allowed him to manipulate others from a distance. From now on I shall devote myself utterly to the hidden poetry of our faces, the terrifying secret that lurks inside our human gaze. This was a dangerous game he’d been dragged into, a deadly trap. Books. were always telling us, everything was connected to everything else. These faces Celâl had been collecting for thirty years might offer him glimpses of this other realm to which he longed to escape. Faces that might once have spoken of pain, misery, and melancholy now said nothing. He began to think there might be a link between the mystery of letters and the meanings in faces. Every object that surrounds you is hiding a secret. Everyone was impersonating someone else and everything was a replica of an absent original. Behind every tree were letters, gruesome, bloodcurdling letters. Our faces had emptied of all meaning, and with it, the art of reading faces. Our eyebrows, our eyes, our noses, our gazes, our expressions, our faces were blank. There were an infinite number of possible interpretations of any given text. It was like an unending maze of city streets, with each street leading to another: maps resembling human faces. The more he discovers, the more the. mystery. spreads. The smell brought back memories of the days he and Rüya had spent in this apartment. They were all made from this smell. I gazed into the mirror and read my face. I dreamed that I had at last become the person I’ve always longed to become. He felt like a detective who had just found the key to a mystery, who would now be using the same key to open new doors. If you want to turn your world upside down, all you have to do is somehow convince yourself you might be someone else. You’re a flower in the garden of my memory. Istanbul nights are endless, a ghost with a guilty conscience cannot sleep. I believed in a world without heroes. I could never convince you to be content with an ordinary life. It was he who had changed and not the city. Istanbul was an open book to him now, it harbored no secrets. Was this life repeating itself?. First voice is the simple persona, the voice you’ll use with anyone. Second voice belongs to the man you’d like to be, the mask you’ve stolen from those you most admire. Third voice is the dark self, the dark style. That cities are made from addresses, addresses from letters, and letters from faces. To read was to gaze into a mirror. Those who know the secret behind the looking glass are able to travel to the other side. You are possessed of a mighty pen, a pen that can realize all these dreams and astonishing memories. At least once in his life, a writer should have a chance to meet his. perfect reader. We do not have. private. lives in this country. Mystery is sovereign, so treat it with respect. You love me. You loved me with all your heart. Everything you wrote, you wrote to me. You talked about my cherry lips and my crescent eyebrows, all this time I’ve been the one inspiring you. The line between us faded into the mists of my imagination, and I could no longer see where you ended and I began. No one can ever be himself. I am both myself and someone else. I followed him all over Istanbul like a shadow. To live in an oppressed, defeated country is to be someone else. I am someone else, therefore I am. But what if this person I want to become is himself someone else? This is the crux, the heart of the deception. The stories seem to write themselves. They flow by their own logic. For the pages that follow — the. black pages. — are the memoirs of a sleepwalker. Tears. Silence. The noises of a strange house. Because nothing is as surprising as life — Except for writing. Except for writing, the only consolation","Sep 01, 2017"
19540749,Richard Newton,"This booked just squeezed five stars for me. It is not perfect, but it is an interesting and well written book.. What is it about? Well there is a superficial story and you can read it just for that story - the mystery Galip tries to unravel when he wants to find where his missing wife and older cousin have gone. It does intrigue and at times is a page turner, but it is too odd at times to really read for that story alone. Below this it seems to me to be about many things - about writing and being a writer, about love and family, about Turkey balancing between being an Eastern and a Western country, it is about memory and it is about personality - who we really are. I am sure you can find more things to review in this.. It is not an easy read to begin with. It is worth reading the translators note to understand the complexity of translating from Turkish into English, so no ""literal"" translation is going to work. It will always need interpretation. The translator has done a great job as you are never overly conscious you are reading a translation. But Turkish is complex and this means the first 50 pages will probably dissuade many people from going further. I found once I'd got passed these I got into the style of the book and it became a fairly straight forward read - even if like a book by an esoteric sect, you can find layers of meaning here.","Aug 02, 2020"
2140237,Christopher,"While reading Orhan Pamuk's breakthrough novel, it is easy to feel as lost as the central character, a lawyer who discovers that the central mystery is not the whereabouts in enigmatic Istanbul of his missing wife, but rather that of identity itself. His identity, that of a newspaper columnist given to revolutionary tales and historical asides, that of a mysterious caller, and in fact, of Istanbul itself and its relation to the culture and identity of the West are all called into question.. The writing is not dense, in fact, the translation is in turns poetically sinuous and rigidly straightforward. Every other chapter replicates a newspaper column written by a friend of Galip's, and the brother of his wife, who becomes integral to the question of identity in the story. These columns cover a wide array of subject matter, from historical local legends of gangsters and their exploits to deeply introspective examinations of the mystery of life itself.. These column chapters help break up the tedium of the first half of the central narrative, which plods on ponderously after Galip in search of his wife. It is only in the second half that I looked eagerly forward to the narrative chapters, wishing the column chapters would end sooner.","Mar 18, 2009"
978026,Tim,"I picked up this book at a library book sale - in part for the picture of the Hagia Sophia on the cover, the blurbs (""tantalizing,"" ""splendid,"" ""delicious""), and the promise of the exotic in Istanbul. The copy I purchased was published before Pamuk won the Nobel Prize.. This is an intricate and beautifully written book. It is a detective story like Calvino's If On A Winter's Night a Traveller is a detective story. Like that story it is a reflection on writing and identity, but set in Istanbul with hints of Rumi, Sufi mysteries, and the Arabian Nights (as well as many more mundane details). Galip is searching for his missing wife, but also for himself, and seems to think he will find each with his wife's half-brother, a famous newspaper columnist. The journalist's articles form alternate chapters and dig into Istanbul, its history and stories, and the nature of identity in a Turkey inundated with Western images. At times funny, annoying, and heart breakingly sad, the chapters of this book took considerable time and attention to read (it required I be alert, not bedtime reading this). But its imagery, stories, and maybe its ideas, will be with me for awhile.","Feb 26, 2010"
183639,Irwan,"Painfully beautiful, intriguing and an absorbing, labyrinthine story. Will read it once again before I can make any smart comment about this book which offers many pleasures.. One story inside the story is about a Prince who had discovered that the most important question in life was whether or not one could be oneself. This idea is in another level reflected in the protagonist's search for his vanishing wife which is the main plot of the novel.. Sometimes I feel like reading a detective story, another time like reading a philosophical novel like the existentialistic Sartre's Nausea, another time like learning about writing by reading a biography of a columnist, and most of the time like watching a documentary about the street corners in Istanbul. I sheepishly admit that I start to feel like visiting Istanbul.","Jan 13, 2008"

72341080,Bob Newman,"Plotless in Istanbul,---but intriguing nonetheless. Nobody could say THE BLACK BOOK is a thriller, but it is thrilling writing. An Istanbul lawyer's wife disappears. A related columnist also disappears. The lawyer looks for them. That's about it. But the search and the thinking is the thing. Pamuk's style blends Proust with Borges. If you find that intriguing, read the book. Pamuk manages to combine intimate details of life in the modern city of Istanbul with tales of Sufi masters, long ago executioners, Ottoman pashas, and underground fantasies with a great deal of soul-searching on the nature of human identity. ""I want to be somebody else, therefore I am"" is his theme again, following on from his previous work, ""The White Castle"". Dreams, intertwining identities, the connection between writing and life, even cryptograms. This is fascinating stuff. Though sometimes the book lags, it always picks up again with another strange twist. Pamuk is certainly one of the most interesting writers working today.","Feb 26, 2018"
5977690,Rodrigo,"What can I say? I loved it at the beginning, but then it became so repetitive, so illogical... Galip could have been some of the deepest characters ever, but there are moments he seems so dummy... The issue of ""being someone else instead of being one's self"" is really deep and interesting, but although the story is brilliantly written, it never got to the point of being a book you can't put down. In fact, putting it down was sometimes a relief! Finishing it actually became a challenge for me! Just as Ruya and Celal did, the mistery of the plot vanished amidst all these chapters about everybody wondering how to be themselves in Istanbul. Thank God, the end is good, surprising, unexpected, and the last chapter is fast and to the point, although it also has some deep thoughts. I cannot say it's a bad book, but it is certainly hard to read. I'm not sure I will read another book from Pamuk. Probably I will give him a second try...","Aug 06, 2011"
566226,John,"This is the best Pamuk novel I've read, and it is the one that made his reputation in Turkey. It was not as widely-known to English-language readers as two of his subsequent novels (""My Name Is Red"" and ""Snow"") because of a more difficult translation published in 1995. This newer translation is by Pamuk's close English-language collaborator Maureen Freely, and was published in 2006 shortly before Pamuk won the Nobel Prize.. The setting is Istanbul shortly before the military coup of 1980, though the political situation is a mere backdrop for an intensely personal story. (In fact, if you're looking for any political thrills, you're not going to get it, since as in ""Snow"" Pamuk's characters are disaffected and discouraged ex-leftists at best.) There are layers of hypnotic stories about Istanbul here that are best read directly rather than described.","Aug 29, 2009"

But on another, more modernist level, he raises questions of what it is to be an author, the relationship between reader and writer, and ultimately, what defines our identity..

11699787,Simona,"The story is placed in a rather simple frame - a man looking for a missing wife and uncle. From here on, things are a little more complicated ... the story (well, many of them) is complex and very dense at all levels. A rich, picturesque, detailed language with which author paints an atmosphere filled with sadness, melancholy in individuals and in the city - Istanbul (which is a completely independent character) ...and all of them are in a constant search for identity - personal, and through individuals identity of the city and wider - states. The metaphysical questions/searches of an individual are deepened with a wider context through stories (in the form of columns) that capture history, religion, politics, nationality, and of course the collision of the East with the West.. The story has a very dynamic, easy to follow structure - the narration of the abandoned man in alternation with the columns written by the disappeared uncle, which allows fluent (and clear) change between present and the past, but becouse of the richness and density of the ideas, this book requires devoted reader in excelletn reading form.","Feb 28, 2018"

The story is s a rather bizarre ""mystery"" focusing on themes of identity, loss and isolation, amongst other things...and while Pamuk is obviously an amazing stylist (they don't tend to give out Noble Prizes willy-nilly), this particular book seems to have lost quite a bit in the translation...I suspect it would it would have been much more engaging had I been Turkish (lots of references to Turkish history, and specific references to modern day and historical Istanbul) and perhaps reading it in it's native language...there is even a translator's afterword that explains some of the difficulties of the translation, which would have served much better as a forward; setting the template so to speak...while I enjoyed the book overall, I was never completely hooked by it, and even found myself losing interest in the plots and the characters about 2/3 of the way through...though things did pick up a bit and seemed to come together in a much more engaging way towards the end.

18959010,Nihal Vrana,"This book did not say anything to me; it just washed over me. Maybe because it is too familiar; you need to be not-from-Turkey to be able to see it as something deep and mysterious. Although, I am hard-pressed to understand how you can visualize anything with the meager descriptions in the book. I mean I actually know the places you know; and it was even hard for me. Same thing goes for the characters; I literally know at least one person like each character and still all of them were forgettable and two-dimensional.. Besides, the whole tone of the book is whiny while trying to be existential. It ascribes to describe a certain emptiness/bleakness in the life of low-middle class Turks; but for me it only shows an inability to see the richness of the material he is treating on the writer's part.. Maybe the only part I enjoyed in the book is that it captured the psychotic relationship between journal columnists and their audience in Turkey. After reading this book, you can understand why so many columnist in Turkey are being arrested now. Somehow, weirdly, they are very influential..

6087693,Carl,"BEWARE OF SPOILERS!!!. Orhan Pamuk is Turkey's most well-known author, internationally, and The Black Book is proclaimed by The Times Literary Supplement as his masterpiece. It was first published in 1991 and translated into English shortly after that. In an Afterword to this volume the current translator explains the vagaries of translating Turkish into English, and that she did this updated translation because the earlier version failed to reflect the flow of the Turkish language. Also, by being a personal friend of the author, she and he were able to go over the translation together to keep it true to what he was saying and how.. The book begins as a mystery. Galip, a young Turkish lawyer, returns home one evening to pick up his wife, Ruya, for a family dinner, and finds in her place a note from her saying that she has left him and will be in touch. The mystery is discovering why she left and where she is now. That mystery, however, turns out to be fairly easily solved by him; she is with his uncle and her step-brother, Celal, all of whom grew up together in the same apartment building, The City of Hearts Apartments, in Istanbul. As soon as Galip discovers this, but before he has found them, Celal is shot to death in front of the police station by a jealous husband, not Galip, and Galip's wife Ruya is accidentally shot by the police in the crossfire.. That mystery and its solution, however, remains a backdrop for the primary story. Early in the book, the author gives us the clue that the “black book” refers to a detective story, specifically one of his wife's books that Galip finds hidden in her closet. But much later in the book, when he is describing the facing murals in the entrance to an entertainment palace, he notes that the “black book” in the mural which mirrors the other mural is “a book of two parts, two meanings and two stories.” So what is the second story and the second meaning? The real detective story for Galip, and the real mystery story of the book, is that of finding out who he himself is. He does this in the process of searching for Ruya and Celal, as he wanders through two different labyrinths: the streets of Istanbul, the physical labyrinth, and the stories of Celal, the labyrinth of words.. Galip's searches through the streets of Istanbul lead him to places he has never been before, and lead him to discoveries about his city and the Turks who lived in it that he had not really known before. His search through the streets keeps circling the City of Hearts Apartments, where he and Celal and Ruya grew up together, and which formed the center of Celal's writings. Celal, for the past thirty years has been a newspaper columnist with a daily column in which he tells the stories about his family, his neighbors, and Istanbul. Galip has been a faithful reader of those daily columns, and he returns to Celal's apartment to read all of those columns for clues as to where his wife Ruya and Celal might be. What happens instead is, that in the reading, he discovers himself. Specifically, he discovers that he is a writer, and has enough to say himself, that he becomes the writer of Celal's columns before he is found and continuing after he is dead.. The more intriguing question is why Galip faces the challenge of finding out who he really is. One answer is given to him by Mehmet, an obsessed fan of Celal's who has read and memorized every word he has ever written. He keeps calling Galip on Celal's telephone thinking that he is talking with Celal. Mehmet asserts that the real mystery Celal has been driving his readers toward for all of the years of his writing is that: “No one in this country can ever be himself. To live in an oppressed, defeated country is to be someone else.” Galip's problem is that of every citizen of Turkey, and that is one audience Pamuk is addressing.. Above all else, this is a book about stories, and their roles in our lives. Celal is the writer of stories and Ruya is the reader of stories. Apparently she does nothing else with her days but read detective stories. Celal's stories, the newspaper columns that he as been writing for 30 years, the writing of which are eventually taken over by Galip himself, constitute the bulk of the stories in this book. These stories about Celal's family and neighbors and friends and enemies for the first half of the book appear as alternating chapters with those of Galip's search. Then there are the stories Galip discovers in his search for Celal and Ruya: stories of lovers reading about lost lovers in a sequence of stories within stories, “The lovers in the third story would have fallen in love while reading a fourth, and the lovers in the fourth story while reading a fifth;” the story of the Grand Pasha, intentionally and specifically patterned after Dostoyevsky's “The Grand Inquisitor” story from The Brothers Karamazov; and the story of the prince who spent a decade preparing to become a ruler of his people by telling his stories to a scribe so that he might know himself. All of these stories, and in fact everything that has ever been written, are called dreams by the author, “everything that had ever been written, even the greatest and most authoritative texts in the world, were about dreams, not real life, dreams conjured up by words,” and the stories are told by individuals to become themselves. But the stories do not define the person, rather Pamuk asserts on one of the final pages of the book that “Only when a man has run out of things to say, only when he has lost all memory of his past, his books, and memory itself, only when he has plunged into that deep silence will he hear---rising from the depths of his soul, from the infinitely dark labyrinths of his being---the true voice that will allow him to become himself.” That is an incredible statement for a novelist to make.","Nov 23, 2011"
1391890,Philip,"I have visited Turkey, but not Istanbul. It’s one of those iconic places that keeps cropping up in travel plans, but then gets overlooked, possibly because its name fits so easily into my thoughts that I convince myself I have already been there. Having just read Orhan Pamuk’s The Black Book, that illusion will be orders of magnitude stronger. Orhan Pamuk won the 2006 Nobel Prize for literature and this seems to have spurned new translations of his work, new versions which hopefully can widen his readership in the English-speaking world.. The Black Book is a gigantic work. And, in the way that I suspect most readers might understand the term, there is no plot. Suffice it to say that Galip wakes up one morning and his wife has disappeared. He assumes she has gone off to seek out her first husband, Celal, a well-known newspaper columnist. Galip sets off to find Celal and, he assumes, his wife, but strangely the journalist has also disappeared. As a means to help him track down the two missing people, Galip immerses himself in Celal’s life, his writing and, gradually, his very identity. Effectively he becomes the person he is seeking. He re-reads his past work and discovers unknown things about his own, his wife’s and her former husband’s past. By then, however, we cannot be sure if we are dealing with reminiscences of Celal, Galip’s interpretations of them, Galip’s reworking of them, or, indeed, Galip’s own words presented as if they were those of Celal.. But the plot in The Black Book is almost irrelevant. It’s not a book that one reads to discover what happens. It’s a book that’s replete with flavour, experience and history, and the reader feasts on vast helpings of all three.. Byzantium, Constantinople, Istanbul – let’s face it, there is no other city on earth that has been named three times and where, on each occasion, that name has passed into language as an expression of political, strategic, religious and economic pre-eminence. It’s a city that bridges continents, ideologies and faiths. Nowhere else on earth has a greater claim to the very quintessence of humanity than Istanbul. And yet modern Istanbul is a Turkish city, and perhaps its most fascinating aspect is its potential to mirror contemporary debates on religion versus secularism, tradition versus modernity, imperial past versus global present.. The Black Book has thirty-six chapters, each having its own title and prefacing quotation. The form, at least in part, is its content, in that each chapter could be read as if it were an article written by Celal or by Galip impersonating Celal. There is no linear narrative. We experience what inspired the writer and there is no ordering of time or place. But we feel we are in that city. We feel we are living its history, whatever that might be. And we feel we are experiencing contemporary debates on its and its people’s identity. The city is central to everything in the book, with its multiple histories and allegiances mixed into the melting pot of its contemporary form.. Throughout, Galip finds he gradually becomes his quarry, Celal. He trades identities and roles, but never permanently, never for sure. In this way the characters become the city, whose sense of place and multiplicity of identities pervade all, thus mirroring the apparent confusion of its – and humanity’s – complexity. But the people eventually are always welcomed by some aspect of the city’s – and humanity’s – multi-faceted nature.. The Black Book is a work that demands to be re-read, but not because it is in any way a difficult or impenetrable read. I have never been to Istanbul, but like the book, I feel it will be an experience that, once tried, will demand to be re-visited.","Aug 20, 2008"
5924440,Girish,"Pamuk's Black Book is a monster of a book which is frustrating to the reader and yet keeps you turning the pages for the intellectual fodder. The book has a wire thin frame of a detective novel through which it spins an investigation into the metaphysical concepts about identity. So enraptured are you in the tale in most chapters (some sounds familiar) that you don't notice the centre of the supposed mystery disappear from the story as well!. Galip, a lawyer comes back home one evening to find his wife Ruya missing. He hopes to find her through the streets of Istanbul and through the columns of his cousin Celal, who also seems to have disappeared. Alternating between Galip's investigation and Celal's column, the nature of mystery keeps changing till it becomes philosophical. The concept of identity is almost magically explored through novel literary devices that are hypnotic.. He talks about Mannequins that ape western culture, the self that judges you against the person you want to be, the impact of movies through a brothel filled with movie star lookalikes, the blurring of lines between dreams and reality, the influence of books. In fact he teases the reader with influences. He plagiarises the Grand Inquisitor, repeats Rumi's tales, plays out a scene from one of the Turkish classics of romance tales in a tavern - only to get it out of the system. The chapters about Hurufism were revealing, but boring.. The book loses the readers (atleast me) in the exploration of the Turkish political history, the writings on the face, the exploration of Istanbul, Routes through the city and the tales whose significance is not very evident. Your mind keeps going back to the missing Ruya, who we only discover in the columns as hidden references. This is a very clever book - maybe too clever for it's own sake.. Towards the very end of the book, the author almost conspiratorily reveals to us. "".. the task I have set myself - which is not to invent new stories but to set down the tales we have been telling ourselves for centuries"".. And you go - oh! Reading the translators note, you realize in original Turkish it must have been even more magical. The book really made me happy when it ended (pat on the back and what not) but will recommend it as a challenge than to a friend. (Special Thanks to my BR partner!)","Oct 01, 2017"
11504643,Begüm Saçak,"I have never read such an enchanting, mysterious novel in which the ordinary notions of identity are challenged in such a detailed way. The story begins with Ruya's -Galip's wife- disappearance and Galip, suspects that his half-brother Celal who is a columnist, ran way with her. He ends up acting like him and writing his columns just to understand the whereabouts of them. Throughout the book, the reader can witness the details, the particular details that make you Turkish. When I was reading the book, it was finding these memories from the depths of my memory that surprised me the most.. Interestingly, the author builds the story in such a way that it sometimes becomes inseparable to differentiate Galip from Celal; on top of everything, he gets a phone call from a fan and her jealous husband who wants to find Celal(or Galip because he is disguised as him). In other words, everything seemed like a mirror inside a mirror. In the end, I still found myself questioning and the whole book including the characters was a manifesto of the idea that ""noone can ever hope to be himself"".. The book is separated into two parts. Celal's columns and sections where Galip is trying to solve the mystery. Though it is implied that it is sort of like a detective novel, I would consider this book as a product of Eastern mysticism. The author's strong observations add up to the details of the mysterious events.. *One thing that was not natural about this book was the never ending sentences filled with so many descriptions and analogies. Another suggestion I can give is the inclusion of the footnotes for the English translation. I tried to imagine reading this book as a non-Turkish person and all these foreign and cultural references would make no sense to these readers.","May 16, 2016"
39556324,Ahasanul Kabir,"Orhan Pamuk, a juggler among the storytellers. He effortlessly tells so many stories at the same time. A Pamuk novel is like a cake with sprinklings all over it. A main storyline with different monologues and little bites of so many tales.. ‘Kara Katip’, The Black Book in English, revolves around the age old city Istanbul and childhood like almost all other novels of this Nobel laureate with a question ‘‘whether to be or not to be yourself?’’. The protagonist, Galip, a lawyer discovers one evening his wife Ruya disappears almost saying nothing with a casual letter. He thinks she must have gone to her half brother,Celal, a celebrated columnist living a mysterious life. He investigates into the case and tries to locate Celal. At a point he adopts the life of the columnist, impersonating him. Living at his flat, receiving his phone calls even writing his columns. This venture leads him into the heart of the matters in so many ways. He explores The mysterious city and its people, the nostalgia of childhood innocence and deeper inner meanings of mundane things. Then one night over phone he receives a death threat. The game of mystery encloses itself into deep waters.. An exceptional style with the main storyline in a chapter and a insightful column in the next, the novel becomes a Pamuk masterpiece, the first one. Because, in this novel he at last found his own voice and unique way of storytelling. From here he has taken himself to the heights of Marquez, Borges and Eco.","Jan 14, 2018"

And this is definitely not the way to read this book.. The main character, Gallip, one day comes back home and realises his wife, Ruya, has left him. He believes she has run away with Celal, his step-brother and a famous columnist, and that they are hiding somewhere in Istanbul. So he starts looking for them and, in the process, he starts discovering who he is and who he wants to be.. It is so beautifully written. And yet. During most of the book I had no clue where the story was leading, I did not see the purpose of anything. So, instead of getting a bit upset because of the lack of direction of the plot, I decided to sit down, relax, and enjoy the writing. It was the correct decision. After finishing the novel I think I know what the direction was, but there are still a lot of questions in the air (which I think is intentional).

Whether you understand everything in the plot or not (not possible, many things are very language based and that's Turkish, so there's quite a bit that will be lost in translation, even though Freely is such a gifted translator), you get a lot of stories by the time you get to the end. Characters don't communicate through conversations, as much as through exchanging stories; it is deeply immersed in the tradition of Middle-Eastern story telling. What absolute joy!.

But, in this case, I felt that to really like this novel and understand its subtleties, the reader has to know the city of Istanbul by heart, (which could even be considered another character) and be very familiar with modern turkish people.

16819062,صفية,"While the only thing I've known about author was only through his two other books. My Name Is Red. and. The Innocence of Memories. , and nowhere in these two I could feel his postmodern penchant. It's only deep inside it (some 80%) that I was trying to convince myself that it was not some Nabokov I was reading! Not. Despair. I was convincing myself !. Although ironically, and if not that I found the Hurufism farce déplacée, maybe it wasn't a coincidence after all... Since the stories within the story denoted some sort of Hüzün and gloominess... A despair of being oneself !. However, and ever since I opened it I was keeping an eye on finding the common things with his previous books, what his style was about ? Apart from the languished, long, and occasionally tiring paragraphs... His verbosity shocked me and took me back to the French classics such as : Chateaubriand, Zola, Balzac, or sometimes Camus ( Painful Memory. L'homme révolté. ).... At times I thought that if I wasn't familiar with the continuous literary strands - that were inter-knitted in a deconstructionist manner, that you wouldn't know what to do with the final outcome! - I would have given up !. A bizarroïde shape that took you some 500 pages to construct but was there, meaningless, the journey was interesting nevertheless and included roaming Istanbul streets at unusual night hours, dwelling on antique shopfronts,.... And again, I wonder what if Orhan Pamuk became an architect, his empathy for space is something I envy him a lot now ! The ease with which he navigates through Istanbul, which is now almost impossible without a GPS, kept me wondering if there's someone else aside from him with similar skills.. And that pretty sums up what I liked in this book, the endless family scenes, the mundane daily Turkish life, a life of serenity, of patriotism, besides the intricacies of the Turkish language itself: I felt sad not being able to read it in its original language:. ""Translator’s Afterword. ▪ A translation that is utterly faithful to that inner logic will, in their view, open up like a flower to reveal its inner truth."". This was a story about Being, as much as it had sterile digressions about finding oneself, and if one can be oneself after all, it was filled with references going back to Rumi and digging symbols everywhere that it was dizzying... What does it all mean to Be ? It occurred to me to halt at the ambiguity, and yet incongruity of these tirades, that were nonsensical, I was more confused than illuminated, but wasn't this the confusion that was sought after in writing these postmodern pieces ?. “To be oneself,” said the Prince, “a person must hear only his own voice, his own stories, his own thoughts!”","Sep 23, 2019"
13925169,Scott Wojtalik-courter,"This is a preview of sorts as I have not finished the book; I am only about half way through. But, I am writing this short note sort of as a reminder to my future self - the one who will have finished this difficult novel at some later date - of my thoughts at this point. I am just now on page 235 and the 'plot', as it were has just begun. Galip has only just now assumed the identity of the man who is his missing wife's ex-husband. Prior to this there has been a great deal of confusing background about the mix of families who lived in a certain apartment building, and about the popularity and nature of Celal's newspaper column. There has also been many wonderfully descriptive passages on life in Istanbul. Apparently Turkish people, the literate ones, love mysteries and puzzles; the plots of their stories must be hidden as stories within stories obscured by puzzles, and much of this is based on linguistic puns. The translation of these puzzles is very difficult, and I am left wondering if it has been successfully done here. However, I have read several reviews that suggest that the second half of the book is more rewarding than the first, and that this book is only truly enjoyed on its second reading. Pamuk's writing is so beautiful and evocative that I am willing to plod through. Each chapter is rewarding in a way similar to reading poetry: the transformative and transportive quality is the reward more than the plot (other than, say Byron's Don Juan or Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner where both are rewarding). Anyway, we'll see what part two of the book yields.. I have finished now, and though it was a very lengthy process, it was enjoyable nonetheless. After starting the book my wife and I became pregnant and other things besides reading took a front seat. I'd like to say that was the only reason for stopping the progress of this book at less than half-way through, but the real reason is that this is a difficult book to get into. Orhan Pamuk seems to write for different reasons than many other authors. In this sense he reminds me of Umberto Eco. He is a story-teller, and and excellent one at that, just like Eco, but his primary motivation is not necessarily to entertain and/or sell books. There is a 'purpose' behind his writing, and I don't mean to suggest a loftiness, or 'important meaning' behind his work. I mean instead that he is trying to do something with his writing other than tell an A to B to Z story. For those who are willing to take the ride and spend some time trying to figure it out, it is definitely worth the ride. The problem with Pamuk, and even Eco, is both language and intelligence level. They are both written in a foreign language (at least foreign to Americans) and both men are highly intelligent and do not write down to their audience. For Pamuk, the former is especially vex some, as it is revealed by the translator, Turkish is an enigmatic language; a single word can carry with it the meaning of an entire phrase or sentence.. So, that said, my interpretation of the 'story' or 'plot' is as follows, and I could very well be wrong, because Pamuk never comes out and says, ""Mr. Green in the Conservatory with the Rope."" And this is, in some ways, a murder mystery. Galip is married to Ruya who is the ex-wife of Celal, the famous columnist of Istanbul. Celal and Ruya begin carrying on some sort of relationship and eventually disappear at the same time, most likely together. Galip goes looking for them and eventually becomes so obsessed with Celal as to assume his identity. he begins to live in his apartment, wearing his pajamas, sleeping in his bed, using his razor, and even writing his columns. He begins getting mysterious phone calls at Celal's apartment from a fan who is equally obsessed with finding Celal. Eventually, Celal and Ruya are found murdered, though the mystery is never solved. Celal returns to being Galip, though he continues to write Celal's column for some time under the pretense of there being many unpublished works left behind.. The plot, as such, does not unwind as naturally as I have written it. There are very lengthy sections on identity, faces, letters in faces, mirrors, Istanbul, streets, maps, history, legends, etc., wherein it is easy to get lost, and I think that is the point. the obfuscation is intended to elicit the state of mind of the characters, even to the point of having a last-chapter interjection from the narrator who may or may not be Galip, or possibly the mystery-man/murderer who may also be Galip. The purpose of this book, I think, is to examine what identity is; how do we as people and as a people find and lose our identity, and what is it anyway? There is an early section (well, some 200+ pages into it) where it is said that to commit a murder you must become someone else. For the simple purposes of plot, that leads me to believe that Galip is both the mystery man who was constantly calling him and the murderer of Celal and Ruya. Which makes this book also about the psychology of jealousy and inferiority complexes.. Anyway, this is not a book for the beach; it is a book to be read with both eyes wide open and for those who love puzzles, word games, secrets, double-meanings, and mystery, and maybe even some magic and slight-of-hand. Pamuk is a master, but that does not mean he is for everyone. At times I wasn't even sure he was for me.","Oct 25, 2012"

Of course, it has an intriguing mystery at its core. But soon you realise, the answer to the mystery is not going to be easy to comprehend, and it gets even more unconventional by the time you reach midway. The book is an elusive and provocative meditation on identity, how history and people around us play a significant role in shaping our character, it even reflects on how writing could influence a person's identity.

5603048,Jeruen,"I have previously read several novels of Orhan Pamuk before. I began with. My Name is Red. , followed by. Snow. , and then the. Museum of Innocence. . He is an author I definitely appreciate, though I have to say I didn’t like him in the beginning. However, that opinion slowly changed, and now he is one of my favorite authors.. I especially like his post-modern style of writing. In every one of his books, he usually appears as a minor character. I don’t remember noticing that in. My Name is Red. , but in. Snow. , that was definitely prominent. And in. The Museum of Innocence. , Pamuk also appeared as a guest in a wedding. So I was already expecting that somewhere in this book, Pamuk would also appear.. The interesting thing is that they say that this is the book where Orhan Pamuk first discovered his voice. And yes, it is indeed the case that this book was published way before the other books that made him famous in the English-speaking world. So for a while, this book was something that was only accessible to Turkish speakers, since after all, the original is in Turkish.. That changed, when Maureen Freely completed her translation of this novel to English. And so I was looking forward to reading it this time, and I finally got the chance to do so recently.. So what is this book about?. This novel is in essence a mystery novel. Yet a very unconventional one. The main character is Galip, who finds his wife someday to be missing. He thinks that his wife Ruya has left him and went back to an old fling of hers, Celal. Celal happens to be a journalist, and so Galip decides that he would investigate on his own and try to find where Ruya and Celal are, who also happens to have disappeared somehow. Hence, the majority of the book tracks and follows Galip in his attempt to reconstruct past events, trying to follow Celal, visiting Celal’s offices, homes, hideouts, and so forth. And in the whole process, Galip slowly embodies Celal, even pretending to be him, wearing his clothes, living in his empty apartment, in his search.. Plotwise, there is a very simple plot, that is, the book is about Galip’s search for Ruya and Celal. However, it immediately gets complicated. The novel has several levels, and there are plenty of stories embedded within the main storyline. Celal is a journalist, and therefore sometimes the novel goes into the articles that Celal has written. This means that this is a book that is relatively hard to read and follow. The narrator changes all the time. In fact, this reminds me of. My Name is Red. , which was the first novel of Pamuk I have read. In that novel, there is a different narrator every chapter. No wonder people claim that this novel is where Pamuk has found his voice: there are traces of his style that are evident in the other later novels of his.. In my opinion, reading. The Black Book. is not about trying to find out what happened with Galip, Ruya, and Celal. Because I should say that in the end, it was also not clear what exactly happened. There was a murder at the end, where one of the missing characters finally appear, albeit dead. However, it wasn’t clear why this character died, and who killed this person. Rather, in my opinion, reading this novel is more about experiencing the very unique literary sensation that only a writer like Orhan Pamuk can deliver. It was definitely a great experience, and something that I enjoyed a lot. I was afraid that the experience would eventually end, as I turned the pages one by one. While. The Museum of Innocence. is still my most favorite Pamuk novel,. The Black Book. comes a very close second. I give this book 5 out of 5 stars.. See my other book reviews. here. .","Feb 14, 2015"

6922752,Chris,"Celebrated Turkish Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk first found his own unique voice, along with a legion of loyal admirers, in this dense little musing on the nature of identity, which covers much of the same ground as his preceding ""The White Castle"", but to greater effect, and was first translated into English in 1994, only to be retranslated for a vastly superior second publishing in 2006 by the accomplished Maureen Freely, who explains all in an illuminating afterword.. Pamuk's main character, Istanbul lawyer Galip, is a curiously bland cipher, who, along with the story of his search for his estranged wife Ruya, seems to serve little purpose other than to act as a mouthpiece for the author's commentary on his own interstitial musings on the City on the Bospheros and its denizens that both interrupt and drive the plot as they appear as supposed newspaper columns by the protagonists mysterious elder cousin in every other chapter of the book.. Pamuk uses this unique structure, accurately described elsewhere as a post-modern update of ""1001 Arabian Nights"", to dissect the nature of story-telling as a means of establishing identity (both personal and national) before finally emerging from the behind the curtain himself to bring a somewhat forced conclusion to an intense and intriguing tale that could have nonetheless done with some editorial paring down of the author's literary excesses that at times make this volume a chore to read..

75671,Gerald,"I wanted to invite Pamuk into my club of favorite authors, but he's still in the waiting room. He lost me about halfway through this one. Main character Galip goes searching for his disappeared wife Ruya. But he doesn't really bother to look in any of the likely places, and he tells everyone in the family she's ill at home. He gives no reason for this behavior. Journalist Celal, a relative, is apparently missing, too. Presumably he and Ruya are together, but we suspect this long before Galip does, and then he doesn't bother for what seems a long time to find out. Oh, and Galip could be posing as Celal, and it's often unclear who is the first-person narrator of each chapter--Celal or Galip posing as Celal? Galip's wanderings and musings, as well as Celal's metaphorical stories, became so disconnected that I had to reread the cover blurb to make sure this wasn't a collection of short stories. Maybe, even though I delighted in my travels to Istanbul, I can't get the Turkish mindset? Translator Maureen Freely says the language is complicated: ""...Nouns in even the simplest sentences can carry five or six suffixes. ('Apparently, they were inside their houses' is a single word.)"" (Zoiks!) The prose is often beautiful but strikes me often as irrelevant or pointless, especially when the book's plot has been set up as something of a mystery.","Oct 27, 2009"

Actually, this book is deluding, deceiving.. Translator's afterword helped explain some of the troubles I had following it - Turkish is a specific language with no verb ""to be"", and Pamuk is amongst writers who likes playing with very, very long sentences which change their meaning and moods as you go through each of them with possible twist in the end.. A style like that must be damaged by translation, no matter how good translation is - simply because English does not have the same flow.. I really wanted to like this book, but apart from translation issue I believe it is seriously too long - middle part being much too repetitive and ... simply boring.. Reading was not enjoyable.

7841372,Veronique,"A book that's supposed to be a detective story and about identity, but the plot is quite non-existent and rapidly you find out is is mostly a successions of stories about Turkey's history, legends, philosophy etc. This is a long book (and feels even longer), not easy to read and I could not immerse myself in it. I was hoping more about the search of identity, and did not expect these endless description about Turkey's culture etc. (which does not mean I am not interested in the country's culture, just not presented that way).. I guess I was hoping more of a book like Paul Auster is famous for, sort of a detective story as an excuse for exploring the search for identity and life's meaning. I am not saying it is not a good book, simply not what I expected. Some of the descriptions are so long, it felt like I was reading Proust again, the kind of literature I don't enjoy.","Mar 01, 2013"
8029847,Saharra George,"Pamuk is a talented and poetic writer, but the style didn't mesh well with the plot. However, the plot was secondary to the book's purpose anyway so I suppose it doesn't matter.. The first 150 pages of the book are really tight and well-written and drew me in, but then the narrative structure deliberately dissolves and the book spends enormous amounts of time having the main character pontificate about Istanbul and its history while walking around or just generally observing his surroundings. The problem is that it begins to feel empty and it's very difficult to stay tethered to the story. It pains me to say it, but at times it even grew tedious and I found myself ambivalent about the author's message.. I can recognize this as being extremely well written but it never struck me as deep enough, or the philosophy important enough, to justify a 170k word book.","Aug 27, 2016"

No matter what your nationality, you won't want to deny yourself the pleasure of reading this book.. Its full of stories within the main story, relating to both Turkey's Ottoman past and contemporary Istanbul. What makes it all so fun is the Authors writing style that welcomes us to Istanbul, the magical, mystical portal to the East..

But this is clearly not a book written for me. It is a highly complicated novel written for the Turkish intellectual reader. For the most part, the references, allegories, allusions, and every level of this novel goes well over my head. The way the book is written, both with regards to the choice of words, the repetitions, the detailed descriptions of things, seemingly random things, as well as the mentioned distance to the subject matters, makes it impossible for me to even feel what is supposedly a book that serenades the city of Istanbul. I was hoping to the very end that something good (for me as a reader) would be hidden in this book, but I'm afraid it went under my radar.","Mar 05, 2018"

With underlying themes of identity, fear, hidden messages and reference to the political instablity of Turkey in recent times, this book was exciting to read. Pahmuk's style is verbose and the story often jumps from one story straight into another, making it hard to follow if you are unused to his style, however I definitely recommend perservering. I chose this for our book club and although it wasn't people's favourite book, those that finished it agreed that it was worth the struggle and that it gets better and better as it nears the end.","Aug 20, 2008"

The general theme and questions about identity and what it means to ""truly be one's self"" are good (I definitely underlined a lot of passages), but, for me, weeding through the pretension to get to the nuggets of thought provoking prose was quite laborious. I thought that maybe if I had been to Istanbul or spoke Turkish, I would have liked the whole thing better. However, when I asked my Turkish friend, who grew up in Istanbul, about this book she said ""Oh my God. That book is awful. Read his other stuff. It's so much better."" Maybe I will.

1842337,Aaron,"Like a confused ""Name of the Rose,"" but with an ungodly proliferation of Arabian-Nights style interjected stories, occasionally interesting philosophical poetic musings. As with ""Snow"", the women are especially under-drawn, just pretty figures and faces who nominally mean a great deal to the men involved, but for no particular reason that we can understand. The main character, whose wife has run off, is a particularly strange type: not once does he really try to figure out why his wife has left, nor what about him or her might have led to this (of course, any musing on the wife's motivation would require actually painting her in more seriously), and the story, as with Snow, is preposterously strange. Some descriptive bits are worth the while. Afraid I can't recommend very highly.","Jan 25, 2009"

This book might be too obscure for readers unfamiliar with the area (though I loved Satanic Verses and know little about all of the pop culture and other references), but he deserved the prizes he got for this one. Snow was also good, but I found My Name Is Red somewhat unreadable. Reminiscent of Nabokov - think Pale Fire.","Apr 08, 2011"

And I guess I could keep reaching for other metaphors, and for other books or for that matter films which this book is ""like"", but really it is sui generis.

Maybe he only exists because he is one of the characters of his own books? Or there anyway exists another Orhan, in this b/w Istanbul, which the real Orhan Pamuk maybe wants to be.

But the plot was perfect for Pamuk's exploration of identity, readers and writers, and there were plenty of gems hiding out in his long passages about Turkish history. I like how Pamuk explores the expression, interpretation and effects of art in his novels: My Name is Red - visual art; Snow - political performance art; and The Black Book - literature. Maureen Freely's translator's notes at the back of the book are really fascinating, too. I want to learn Turkish.","Sep 14, 2007"

I always finish a Pamuk novel thinking about the parts I couldn't even grasp because the idea is so huge. Pamuk pays attention to the slightest detail. As an example, without creating a spoiler, imagine the color green used consistently to define the trail upon which a detective seeks answers and the color blue used to denote warmth and connection......intriguing, isn't it? The primary theme is that of identity: human, cultural, and individual. A tough, dense read worth every word!","Feb 17, 2008"

However my favorable impressions waned after the first third to half of the book and ultimately the positive aspects of the book were eclipsed by what was first a positive characteristic: the prose. That is, I quickly grew tired of endless filigree of this or that -none of which helped develop the plot per se. Was there a plot? I actually had to check another source to be sure. So while Snow was good, this book was too much for me. Basically I skimmed the whole second half which is tantamount to saying that I was not able to complete this book.","Oct 03, 2009"

Perhaps if I knew something about Turkey or its politics in the last half-century I would have found this less opaque. Unfortunately, I don't have that knowledge. Apparently this book was very difficult to translate, and if I could read Turkish, that also may have helped me appreciate it more. Pamuk is clearly a writer of great skill, but I just couldn't get into a story about a guy of questionable sanity running frantically around Istanbul looking for his wife, having bizarre conversations, and looking for signs and secret messages in everything.","Jun 10, 2010"
220860,Ayse Arf,"At first, this book really appealed to my more grim sense of people's universal experience of misery and disappointment and feelings of inadequacy, but then the exploration of those feelings dragged on, and on, and on, and on and on to the point where I resolved to slog through it as a test of will and because I don't like leaving books unfinished. This book most certainly did not need to be almost 500 pages long. His editor should have encouraged him to axe 100 pages or more.. There are, nonetheless, some really beautifully written passages and an almost affectionately bleak presentation of the inevitability of dissatisfaction.","Jul 12, 2010"
32668897,Chris Evans,"Pamuk often seems to use genre literature (whodunnits, thrillers, historical romance) with all their characteristics of tight plotting and detail as his jumping off point, but then allows the chaos and entropy that threaten existence, to break down and fragment both the sense of identity of his protagonist and the setting (Istanbul) in which he acts. The result is nightmare journey through a city where everything shifts, not least the identity of the main character.

I found it more engaging than Snow, which I read previously, and which is also translated by Maureen Freely, but it does go on. I feel I understood what it was trying to say early on and then just wished it wouldn't keep on about it so much..

He presents the same ideas over and over with such small changes that it became quite boring for me. Not that I wanted to see plot advancement all the time, but it went on and on for pages at a time really saying nothing in many different ways.

It was obvious from near the start who she was with thus his search (along with its existential tangents that are always the real focus of Pamuk's books) seemed incredibly contrived.

Not exactly the best book to read after being dumped.. It would be pretty much unbearable if it weren't for the fact that Pamuk is such a motherfucker of a writer, able to conjure up heartbreakingly ordinary, beautiful scenes and advance the plot before you even realize what he's doing. I'm really looking forward to this.","Aug 13, 2007"

The main character then tries to take over the life of the missing journalist, answering his calls and writing his columns. The book is written in Pamuk's typically dense prose, with lots of social commentary, but I found it a little hard to follow. I think the plot wasn't quite strong enough to carry the character study and the many chapters of ruminating on Turkish history and culture. However, it was still a pleasant read in a distinctive style.","Dec 15, 2012"
1783458,Lindsey,"An excellent meditation on identity on a variety of levels. Set in Istanbul, Turkey, the main character, Galip is unhappy with his life as a lawyer and after his wife disappears begins a quest to figure out who he is. His cousin, Celal is a famous journalist whose opininated, meditative columns offer a glimpse into Istanbul, a city also struggling with its identity. Should it adhere to its old customs or should it be modern? Is it changing or dying? All of these questions are asked as Pamuk once again leads his readers on a search for what it means to know who you are.","Jan 09, 2013"
7768973,Gena,"I confess. I couldn't finish the book. Maybe I'm lacking the brain cells at this current, overloaded phase of my life. Maybe it's that the book is even more difficult in translation. Whatever the reason, this lovely, densely knitted, opaque labyrinth of a book was too much for me. I'd find myself gliding over paragraphs only to have to reread them. And I love ideas and language and inquiries into identity and memory. I skimmed the last half. I feel both relieved and ashamed-- as if I quit a marathon. Maybe I've robbed myself of a sublime experience. Guess I can try again later.","Feb 09, 2014"
1012436,Salvatore,"A lengthy monument to narrative studies - the intricacies and beauties of language, but also the obsessions and delusions and madness that it can also evoke. Such as the dangers of reading with intent.. This is a story of a man, Galip, who one day discovers his wife is missing. As is his relative, a famous newspaper columnist. Galip searches high and low through Istanbul for them. Slowly the novel becomes less about this search and more about what it means to be oneself - and if that is ever possible (a Pamuk theme that he owns).. Meandering yes, but a beautiful and sometimes eerie ride.","Aug 31, 2015"
10425489,Silvia Obaid,"This novel was different than the usual fiction I read before. First of all in my opinion the fiction was only the structure of the novel, the experience which the novel offers is a journey in the timeline of the Turkish Identity as it evolves from the effects of the political and cultural change over centuries, it walks the reader's mind through some of the central events and characters which build the frames of reference for the traditional Turk. This novel is a very rich experience, I think I will read this book again in a year or so.","Jan 09, 2016"
2246910,Veronika Gallisova,"I have to say I bought this book because ""The Black Book"" sound so mysterious. Now I can say I was not mistaken. I have never read anything from Orhan Pamuk, but I can say it was not boring, it was not casual or normal. The story is indescribable, number of the characters is reducing and in the end of the book, there is a really nice explanation why everything ends like this. I must say I'd rather read a story with some action in it, but this one really got something inside.","Feb 02, 2010"

The central mystery of the book; the disappearance of the journalist Celal and his ex-wife Ruya gets lost on the writer's long exposes on identity and ancient vs modern Turkey.. The author would occasionally throw you a morsel of information to keep the story line going but without extensive familiarity with Turkish history and thought, I had to abandon it.. I really wanted to like this though...","May 01, 2011"

It's hilarious -- and, as it often happens with Pamuk, there are mirrors, uncertain identities, and the clash of the East and the West, so it's complex and hilarious at the same time.","Sep 23, 2011"
8889261,Manu,"Read this in 2008. Good translation and beautiful lyrical novel.. It has interspersed essays in between major storyline. One chapter story and one chapter essay. Essays are far better than the story. But story is still good with relations in mind instead of the world and beautiful description of female protagonist simply through the narrative by her husband. A deep, difficult read but the language and imagery keeps one reading it. As far as I read Pamuk, this was his best book.","Apr 27, 2012"
21219774,John,"While Orhan Pamuk writes beautifully, this book was a tough one for me to finish. Maybe it is the translation, or maybe its just me, but I found the book going off on hard to follow tangents. The main story is a good one, but that is only 50% of the book. The other half involves symbolism and things I could not follow. Maybe if I were more versed in Turkish/Ottoman history I would have enjoyed it more. Anyway, I had hoped it would be as good as Snow, but for me it was not.","Jan 13, 2014"
4732533,Kirsten,"I loved Snow. I really, really loved Snow. This was so bad I finally gave halfway through. It is almost like he tried to string together a bunch of essays, notes, and half-finished short stories and call it a novel. Unless you have a deep knowledge of Istanbul neighborhoods and history, it is incredibly confusing. The characters are wisps. I hope this is not indicative of Pamuk's other works!","Oct 28, 2014"
34114775,Tufo,"In short: This is quite a special story, mysterious, intricate and unconventional. In fact it is largely a collection of partly intertwined short stories. The book is very well written, but you need a lot of patience because the main plot develops painstakingly slow and there is a lot of detailed descriptions. There are many interesting details about Istanbul and its an advantage if you know the town.","Nov 01, 2014"
26856387,Swapna Sundar,"Excellent study of our own understanding of our identity; contentment and confusion about how we want to be seen, how we see ourselves, and how we see others...but the genius lies in Pamuk's ability to talk about personal identity, political identity, national identity, cultural identity...all together, leaving you with an internal understanding of his questions and unable to identify intellectually the answers that we are looking for.","Feb 24, 2015"
55473575,Funda Yokari,"I don't want to say it was boring; however, I am of the opinion that the author was still an amateur (25 Yrs ago) using unnecessary number of metaphors, depictions and repetitions which created half of the book and could have cut off. Even though the story wakes up the curiosity, many times I reached the edge of giving the book up. Unfortunately this was the first book of the author that I did not enjoy.","Jan 28, 2017"
20268913,Kelly Boylan,"You could call this an unconventional mystery novel, like the description on the back of the book does, but that would be setting the wrong expectation. Read this book if you're up for a non-linear exploration of Turkish identity. The story rambles and lost me for a bit in the middle, maybe a translation issue. But it was beautiful throughout and left me itching to see Istanbul for myself. Best part was the author's musings on what might be found on the sea floor if the Bosphorus dried up.","Mar 21, 2017"
27262778,Shuprova,"Can't describe this book as anything but an assault on your senses. In true Pamuk fashion, nothing really happens, but everything happens. A book that is packed with emotion from beginning to end that are passionate to the level of being disconcerting at times. The Black Book is more like an experience than a novel. Can be difficult to follow his trail of thought at times, especially if you have long time gaps in between chapters, but definitely worth a read.","Jul 08, 2018"

4362608,Vaibhav,"A fictitious article, an essay, book or just a random conversation with the person you have never met. When you read some of these( or other) things again and again, it will often happen that the old meaning, which you were all too sure of, starts to melt away giving way to the obvious meaning which you have long suspected.. So when you are reading a good book (cue: the one which makes you read the world, rather than just itself) which boast of being a religious-political thriller, and you are assaulted with a chapter titled: We're Not Stupid, We're Just Poor. It’s only natural that you immediately think of the perception that our society is arranged in decreasing order of intelligence. How we think of the poor, it’s because they are stupid that they haven’t figured out how to make money and live good life. Rich folks think this of poor folks, rich country for poor country, and so on. But most of all you’d be haunted by all the new types of Secularist, Islamist, Nationalist, and Leftist you’d find in there. Although a political thriller –as it claims- it doesn’t have any government, government agent, corporation, any establishment, or even spies. All there is are bunch of poor people stranded in a small town completely cut off from outside world for snow. It’s then only, among those individuals with dangerously conflicting ideas, you get to realize what politics is all about: ideas and beliefs. No sooner than you have felt this very basic fact, you’ll be assaulted by secularists who are not as un-biased as they seem, Islamists whose only mistake is that they have self-respect, nationalists who live in the past, leftists, and two young boys who are discovering what it’s like to have faith. Well into the book, you’d know that there is no way this story can end ever.. When you, rather complacently, would figure that it might be the most influential book you’ll ever read, soon enough, you’ll stumble upon another one which will mock you for holding such deluded notions. This new book would look like a detective novel, read like a detective novel, but the problem is it wouldn’t feel like one. No murder, no criminals, no pursuit, ever morphing identities, you wouldn’t know who is searching and what, or even if there is anything to search.. Much early in the book, you’ll read: Galip had once told Ruya that the only detective book he’d ever want to read would the one in which not even author knew the murderer’s identity. Instead of decorating the story with clues and red herrings, the author would be forced to come to grips with his characters and his subject, and his characters would have a chance to become people in a book instead of just fragments of their author’s imagination.. You’d feel the nervous, being intimidated, when the protagonist would say that he finds it incredibly artificial when everything just falls into the place at the end of a detective book, and at this precise moment, the author would whisper all the clues into the detective’s ears, who is till now seemingly ignorant, and who would solve the mystery then and there. Just as you read this, you’d know the following story would not be a simple one, would not be one story, but story becoming another story, yearning to become another story and most of the time passing off as some another story, just as people do.. You shouldn’t be bothered if you are required to solve all the mysteries of the world in pursuit of your search as everything will become a clue: you, your wife, all the possessing of your wife, all the column her ex-lover writes, mystery behind mannequins influencing people’s expression, all the faces around you, the letters engraved in those faces: two brow lines, four eye lashes, and one hairline –seven in all, only till the face is divided into two by ‘late arriving nose’ and then the letter engraved will be fourteen. Then you’ll take account into the more poetic real and imaginary lines, the number doubles again, leaving you with a new twenty eight letter language to decipher. Not to mention the entire history, all the fables that were ever created, parables that were ever told, and secret meaning hidden behind all the words used. The world will be a sea of clues; every drop will bore the salty taste of mystery behind it. Each and everything would morph into a clue pointing you to another world which is bare of mysteries, and where in you can become someone else.. When you’ll see in the faces of people the yearn to become someone else, to pass off as someone else, it is imminent that you’ll think of every time you had already known this. When people would wish Merry Christmas, with an unusual zeal, and perhaps would lack that zeal even their own festivals and would conveniently forget other ones. When people would mention Boxing Day in a place where there is no such thing, and when those same people would wish each other Thanksgiving, you’ll almost be sure that they have already become someone else. At this time, even their voice will change and so will their speech, they will look different but you’ll easily be able to tell the truth just by having one look at the conflict on their faces. They have long forgotten who they really are; they have forgotten their history, their culture, their identity.. It is at this precise moment, you’d be assaulted by two questions:. Do you have trouble being yourself?. Is there a way a man can only be himself?. Each of these clues would lead you to another mystery, that is waiting to be unveiled, mystery behind hidden meaning of words. Words which contains second, third or even more meanings that are hidden; you just have to look for them. You have to convince yourself of the fact that they will reveal themselves eventually. Over time, you’ll know of the mystery words harbor, the secrecy they enjoy, to hide infinite amount of meaning. When you will be conversing with somebody you know, or don’t, and in absence of special circumstances, it is natural that everything will be obvious. But you’ll know what they really mean, its not to say that they are lying, they just mean something else. Just by paying attention to words, you’ll know, since they mean something else, their choice of words will invariably be biased. And sometimes, it will also happen that you’ll be able to know what the other person hasn’t even realized yet. All this just by paying attention to words, and their hidden meaning. As when an accuse becomes upset on being accused, you’d know of the prime thing that makes human upset: guilt. Now think how will you feel when, later, you get to know that the hidden meaning, which you sought after peeling all the layers and which was never said or implied by the unknown person, is indeed the only truth not just your delusional fantasy? So, it is only obvious, that eventually you’d stop looking at the meaning that is all too obvious but at the hidden meaning, because only it is the truth. Words will never reveal their true meaning and it is only after number of attempts you can hope to get the meaning that is always hidden layers beneath.. In the end you know that your gut feeling, the intuition is the only real meaning left in the things.. But mostly, even you wouldn’t realize, you wouldn’t want to look for true hidden meanings because you’d be afraid of what you might find.. It is, at this moment, when you are lost among, and overwhelmed by, hidden meanings; you’d try to make sense of things and this is all that will come out( by that green pen of yours):. I wonder, do people always mean what they are saying, or they are pointing you to an entirely different meaning. Often I feel maybe people are speaking in codes, some subtle meaning, if only I can understand the meaning, I’ll be able to talk to them. Of course I would also say some things, at the same time, implying other things. Then we would, finally, be able to have a conversation. To an onlooker, we’d be talking normally, perhaps about something relevant to current time, about a movie, a book, or some music we both just happen to like. But, all this time, I’d know the other person is reading all the signs, from the things I am saying, more often he’ll also get the meaning of things I had thought I’d say subtly but I didn’t. When we would be talking about a thing, quite normally, it’s natural that we’d both be aware of the other thing that this thing signifies, because we are indeed only talking about the other thing. When we’d be talking about a movie, immediately we both would know, that the conversation is not about this movie but some other movie whose fate is linked with this movie, maybe because the director was only able to make this movie because he had made the movie which we are really talking about. . Or perhaps, we would really be talking about an actor which is not in this movie, but only because he didn’t want to. A song would really mean an incidence worn into its lyrics, a book would refer to the thing which has really affected us, cat would really mean dog, while a dog would mean the book which has dog on its cover, and he would mean she and so on. In our conversation, things will refer to their real meaning, not to the meaning that people take of granted. Then, looking down, we’ll laugh at the world, but maybe we’ll really be frowning for their innocence and shallowness, due to which they will never get the true meaning that things signify.. When you are searching for something very hardly, after long enough the search will become more important than the thing itself. You won’t be sure anymore of the thing you really want to seek.. In the end, you’d know the real question is, Did Apes feel the same solidarity as Darwin did towards them? He hadn’t got any way to communicate by which he could confirm. Even if he’d have tried, it would have been, literally, like talking to chimps.. All the real meanings are hidden and only the hidden meanings are real.","Apr 21, 2012"
62292689,Jack Deighton,"Galip comes home to find his wife Rüya (with whom he has been besotted since childhood and who is also his cousin – apparently this last is a custom widespread in Turkey) has left him. He spends the rest of the novel trying to find out where she has gone. Back to her first husband, once a left-wing firebrand? Or to live with her half-brother Celâl, a famous columnist for the newspaper. Milliyet. , who has also disappeared?. The chapters written from Galip’s point of view alternate with those in which Celâl’s columns are reproduced, a device which allows Pamuk to ruminate on Turkish and Istanbul history, customs and predilections. It is slightly more complicated than that as just over halfway through, with Celâl’s stock of columns and reprints beginning to run out, Galip takes to writing them himself and presenting them as Celâl’s, so it is possible that all such extracts may in fact be Galip’s thoughts. Indeed one telephone caller to Galip in the guise of Celâl asks if these columns contain the signs that would lead to life’s secret meaning -even if that secret meant nothing. He adds his insight that, “‘No one in this country can ever be himself.’”. In search of Rüya, Galip wanders the streets of Istanbul, especially at night. (A habit also attributed to Ibn Rashid, Sultan Selim, and Mehmet the Conqueror.) This is “the endless fascination afforded to those who wander a city in disguise.” In this novel the presence of the city as in effect a character in its own right - as are all big cities to be fair - is extremely pronounced. After reading the book it’s as if I could walk the place blindfolded. Istanbul also loomed large in the author’s later novel,. The Museum of Innocence. , and that book’s preoccupation with mementos of a life is prefigured here in. The Black Book. . What Rüya has left behind, Galip’s memories of Rüya and the remnants of Celâl’s existence are described in loving detail. Again prevalent is the habit of smoking. Everyone in this seems surrounded by clouds of blue tobacco smoke. Once more football as an important factor in Turkish life makes its appearance. (Imagine the reception a British “literary” novel would receive if it mentioned the game at all.). Rüya was an avid reader of detective novels (which is to say Western detective novels, as the Turkish variant barely existed at the time of writing) and. The Black Book. has been described as a detective, or at least a mystery, novel. There is a mystery, the disappearances, but the usual preoccupations of a detective novel are absent and, as a detective, Galip is spectacularly ineffective even if, ‘murders that explain books and books that explain murders have a universal appeal, because it is only when a man believes himself to be someone else that he can bring the cudgel down on the victim’s head….. We learn all the rituals and telling details of murder from others, in other words, from legends, stories, reminiscences, and newspapers. In short, we learn about murder from literature….. Even the simplest murder … is an imitation, a literary imitation, even if its perpetrator doesn’t know it.’. Rather than a mystery. The Black Book. is more an examination of Turkey/Istanbul as seen through the apparently random reflections of Galip on his travels through the city or Celâl in his columns. To an outsider at least, Pamuk appears to have captured his city and culture in the round by focusing on the particular. It is also a rumination on the nature of life and story (or stories within stories inside stories.) “Each story led to another story in an infinite chain,” and, “no matter where they were set …. the love stories were sad and moving.”. In one of these a character pleads, “If people would only just be themselves. If only they would stop telling stories!” In another an heir apparent comes to believe, ‘A sultan’s duty is not to be happy – it is to be himself… it is everyone’s duty - everyone’s.’. The novel is a thinking writer’s work. Galip ponders on the second meanings that might be lurking inside pieces of writing – inviting us to speculate on what he might be hiding in plain sight. As the novel progresses so too does Galip develop a belief about the letters of the alphabet to be discerned on people’s faces and that everything that had ever been written, even the greatest and most authoritative texts in the world, were [sic] about dreams, not real life, dreams conjured up by words. That a text provides insights about its author is suggested by the thought, “What did it mean to read a text if it did not mean entering into the garden of its author’s memory?”. Galip (who, a very short passage intimates, may be Pamuk himself, an intimation which might itself constitute a misdirection) comes to the notion that nothing is as surprising as life. Except for writing, the only consolation.","Mar 08, 2018"
119316972,Clay C.,"The Black Book is a phenomenal, mysterious, confusing, emotional journey that allows its readers to play the detective in the mystery novel genre that it subverts, albeit a detective who finds clues, connections, and red herrings everywhere that only make the web of mystery even more impenetrable.. In the snowy winter streets of Istanbul, a lawyer named Galip finds that his beloved but mysterious wife (and cousin!) Rüya has gone missing. Rather than going to the police, Galip takes it upon himself to find Rüya, slowly becoming one of the characters in the detective novels she read obsessively. At the same time, his renowned cousin Celal (Rüya's half-brother), who has gained fame and notoreity through his columns on Istanbul life, has also gone missing. Galip hits the streets to solve the mystery, running into characters from his and Celal's past who all seem vaguely to be pointing to the same solution. Is Galip onto something? Or is he just descending deeper and deeper into a conspiratorial mystery that will consume him? Early on in the novel, Galip tells Rüya that the ideal detective novel would not present a world of clever motives and alluring clues with an ingenious but comfortable solution, but instead a world in which neither the detective protagonist or even the author knew the solution to the central mystery. Perhaps he shouldn't have spoken so soon.. Let me stay outright that this book will be likely be confusing and frustrating for readers unless you either A) know a fair amount about broad Middle Eastern history/philosophy and the more specific history of Turkey or B) are open and interested in learning more about it. Otherwise, I can't help but imagine the frequent allusions and references will be irritating. If you are knowledgable or interested in the field though, you'll have a wonderful framework for the mystery to play out on.. Despite the Black Book's uniques, its heavily reminded me of two other major literary works: The Blind Owl by Sadegh Hedayat and If On A Winter's Night A Traveler by Italo Calvino. Like Hedayat's feverish masterpiece, The Black Book features certain symbols or small details that are constantly repeating themselves, in increasingly twisted ways. A reference to some minute detail will stick out in your mind and then hundreds of pages later when that detail resurfaces you'll be sent back searching for the original reference. These details include: a Sufi sect, certain films, names of towns, mannequins, cyclopes, skeletons, an owl on a book cover, a specific Istanbul theater, and many more. My favorite use of this technique is when the burst stuffing of a discarded armchair is describes as resembling the green intestines of a horse only for the ripped-out intestines of dead horses to be compared to the burst stuffing of an old armchair chapters later. This frequent reptitions of small plot details establishes two things: it deepens the driving mystery at the heart of the novel while also providing an almost conspiratorial feeling to the mystery itself. Are these clues left of purpose? Are they a symbol of something bigger or merely left to confuse us? Did we stumble upon another one Pamuk included or are we just so wrapped up in the story we are finding connections where they don't exist?. As for If On A Winter's Night, Pamuk uses a similar narrative device where one chapter describes the main character's journey and the next is an unrelated text (in The Black Book the columns of the mysterious Celal) which playfully or eerily relates to the main story. This produces a similar effect as Calvino's work. At the same time, things like constant pseudonyms, changes of identity, and proliferation of a larger conspiracy are found in both works.. The main theme of the book is identity and becomes clear before too long. Can we ever truly be ourselves? This deceptively simple question is framed around Turkey at the time of the book's writing: a nation with a rich, ancient history that is searching for a way to get a second glance at its last glory while being pulled between its European and Asian identity. The book explores these themes in a fascinating way, exposing the tragic sense of loneliness and helplessness at the heart of most of our lives. Who are we trying to be? Who are we imitating with our gestures, tastes, interactions, and words?. The atmosphere of mystery that Pamuk cultivates is absolutely incredible. If you are a reader who likes to find the clues yourselves, isn't afraid to backtrack and reread as you learn new information, and values the journey more than the destination, I would absolutely recommend this book. Just make sure you take plenty of breaks, or, just like Galip, you will be seeing as web of confounding clues and taunting second-meanings everywhere you look","Aug 31, 2020"
136283,Nate,"An expansive though often uneven novel, but the best parts of this book are so memorable and incredible, that I'm giving it five stars anyway. This is my third book by Orhan Pamuk (I also read Snow and My Name is Red). While the other two were more consistent, this is probably my favorite, although that's largely due to my taste. This book is more Borges-esque, digressive, and experimental than the others. It is one of Pamuk's first books; so even though its dense, it was written by a young"" writer, which you can feel while reading it. (The driving philosophical pursuits that propel the narration froward are the pursuits of someone my age or even younger. Those sort of burning existential questions most people hit in their 20s, but that I'm still grappling with haha).. Its filled with same rich noir like atmosphere of the others I've read. Just brimming with wonderful atmosphere that's easy to get lost in.. When I started it, I didn't immediately think I'd like it -- something about the first chapter felt clunky (though maybe its better on the second read); but I fell in love a few chapters in and began looking forward to each reading session of this book. It is constantly filled with surprises and weird philosophical turns. One never knows where it will go. Sometimes the digressions go on too long; other times they are perfect. Sometimes they are mind-blowing, and other times they are only so-so. But they are consistently surprising and strange in the best way. Despite its obvious influences (Borges, Marquez, others), its the work of a unique voice. The style and themes are so ambitious that I'm surprised its not more uneven than it is. That is, despite my critiques, I think its amazing it works as well as it does. This being his second novel, its clear that he would become the more famous, Nobel Prize winning writer in the future. (The others I read do feel more ""mature"" and focused).. This also feels like a love letter to Istanbul and to city life (one filled with criticism of the city's evolution, but a love letter nonetheless). I coincidentally re-watched Wings of Desire at one point while reading this, which is an ode to Berlin, also filled with magic realism, digressions, and a tapestry style of story telling that drops in and out of lives, with little concern for if they'll enhance the ""plot"" -- because the plot is about exploration, and in the end, about love of a city, or of an idea even. The Black Book is a bit darker than Wings of Desire, but I felt they complemented each other perfectly, and come from a similar artistic place.. This might be the first Pamuk book I've given ""5 stars"" to -- yet I just realized that each time I finish a book of his, I think ""there's no way any of his others are this good."" Then I sort of give up on reading more of him, before I try a different one about a year later, which I end up loving. Maybe I'm just lucky and chose his best three; but if any Orhan Pamuk fans somehow stumble upon this review, please comment on other novels of his you love! I'm definitely becoming a fan.","May 26, 2020"
5887151,Persephone Abbott,"Hey! Tired of the standard plot of a detective story? I sure was, haven’t read a standard detective novel in donkey’s years. Here’s something slightly different. Personally I loved the moment of confession when the would be murderer calls up the protagonist and describes the woof, warp and weave of his murderous inclinations, until that moment the book only vaguely hinted at the potential murderer’s possible actions as quasi imaginary happenings. Then near the end of the phone call the would be murderer demands the address of his victim from the person he thinks is his victim so he can kill him. A la accessory to your own murder idea in third party politics. I mean this takes a detective novel to another level. To boot the person the would be murderer would like to kill, is missing. The would be murderer might kill the wrong person. Always a clever twist in the average detective novel when the body is revealed to be the wrong body – someone else was supposed to be killed. But here the point is: In the case of a crime, which body will do? In fact we are quite unsure of the crime, has there been a crime? Who might commit a crime? Of course in most detective story formulas there is the organization of things to be held accountable: the paring down of props and places so that the reader can understand the scenario. Pamuk, on the other hand, repeatedly lists an entire city and thus the contents of the novel are expansive, not reduced. Then there’s the feeling of someone really ought to take the plunge and do it: be the protagonist AND the victim. But not really. Okay, so the fantasy not quite ending end “to be or not to be” within the pampered court of the sultan world, the brothers holding a knife to another brother’s neck so they can access the throne, is a anyone is capable of both being the hero and the victim? This is the anti-detective story of all times, the bitter conclusion that such brute heroics can only soothe a small part of our inconsolable soul. Where is our identity? Who killed the Turkish identity? Who killed the Babylonians? Will we find a nation, uncover the mystery, in the reading of a detective novel? In the detective world? Is our world ours? Or is our world, preselected, imposed upon us? And that last question, my friends, is the single thought set to be solved in this detective story. For it seems the missing resurface in the novel as fresh corpses long after the facts have disappeared, and the story, not very sensational, had been already told and retold and the bodies properly festooned before burial. History itself triumphs.","Jun 26, 2017"
5691402,Michael,"Well, I didn’t exactly finish it, as I finally gave up after 300 pages, in the middle of a chapter that described Galip looking at photographs upon which Celal had traced letters that he supposedly found in the faces.. I picked this up after reading and enjoying The Museum of Innocence, and the cover told me that it was Pamuk’s masterpiece. I beg to differ. The book is allegedly a story about a man searching for his wife, who has disappeared, but the plot soon founders, or rather, fails to progress. It is really an extended riff on identity (personal and national), authenticity, originality, and history. There are themes that I was able to discern, such as whether modern Turkey has been hopelessly corrupted by its embrace of Western culture, how we all struggle to establish a distinct identity and then resort to stories or imitating others in order to define ourselves, and whether anything that is claimed to be original really is. There are also extensive discussions of Turkish history through the centuries, of which I confess I know little and about which I cannot comment. Some of the discussion is worthwhile and thought-provoking. Much more of it is meandering and tedious.. There is a thin line between art and self-indulgence and I think that this book represents the latter. It is a torrent of words and thoughts that don’t have a lot to hold them together. It is perhaps a failing on my part that I don’t appreciate what is there. But I feel like I gave it a good shot. The last straw was the chapter about finding letters in people’s faces. It was liking looking at the sky and deciding that the clouds are shaped like angels or sports cars. You can see in it what you would like to see. For me, there are too many books waiting to be read from which I might extract much meaning. Which means that I can’t spend any more time on this one, the meaning of which I am not going to grasp.","Mar 14, 2019"
51106811,Batuhan Kuvancı,"As a Turkish reader, this was the book where I came to the conclusion that Orhan Pamuk deserves his reputation. I have read several of his books and I can tell Kara Kitap(Black Book) is the piece where you can get to know the writer most compare to his other works.. It is clear that Pamuk has been influenced very deeply from Oğuz Atay ,who is another extremely successful and much appreciated Turkish novelist focusing on the stream of consciousness, in this book. Even-though almost the whole book seemed like a successful attempt of Atay's stream of consciousness style, the scene and story told in the brothel have so many commonalities with Atay's Tutunamayanlar(The Disconnected) in where he mentions the messiah figure. Also, another Turkish author Yusuf Atılgan, seemed to have a deep effect on Pamuk's story. Both stories in Kara Kitap and Atılgan's Aylak Adam is oriented on looking for a specific lost woman.. The stories told by one of the lead character's ,Celal, and the main idea where it orbits around the questioning of identity has always been identified with Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar. Pamuk also mostly successfully mange to get this harmonised with the story in his book. Therefore, it is safe to state that the biggest factor which I find astonishing in Kara Kitap is the harmony of Oğuz Atay's and Tanpınar's writing styles as well as the content.. Despite the fact that the book as a whole is a success, the part where Pamuk mentions Dostoyevsky's grand inquisitor and trying his own version, there is an absence of passion or enthusiasm.. All in all, Kara Kitap is and will be one of the top reads of Turkish literature by its attempt of integrating many successful author's styles and content. And probably will stay as one of the Pamuk's most successful works for me.","May 02, 2020"
10365969,Jennifer,"I discovered The Black Book on the shelves of my friends' hotel during my stay in Kusadasi. It was one of those ""Give One, Take One"" libraries, and craving a thick juicy read, I mustered up my courage to ask the hotel owner if I could take the book with me to read. He graciously agreed, confessing that the English was too difficult for his comprehension. And so I began:. "" 'Once upon a time...there lived in our city a Prince who discovered that the most important question was whether to be, or not to be, oneself.' "". This is the premise of The Black Book and the theme that is interwoven throughout the mystery of intertwined identities as the protagonist attempts to assume the character of his wife's lover.. ""I dream of putting all these stories together in a single black book...A black book that became in the mirror a book of two parts, two meanings and two stories...it still held together as a single book, and that its mystery was lost somewhere inside it."". The hero's quest to be himself resonated with me as I straddle between two countries and cultures, grappling with the questions of who am I and what it means to be myself in the United States and in Turkey. So many times I have heard the cliche ""Just be yourself"" and it grates on my nerves. Who else would I be? In The Black Book, author Orhan Pamuk wrestles with this question and presents the extremes of both the quest to be yourself to the exclusion of the influence of everyone else and the quest to assume the identity of another in pursuit of love.. Orhan Pamuk is not only a classic Turkish author but acclaimed internationally. His oeuvre should be required reading.","Feb 04, 2018"
18854681,Bruddy,"I found this book very challenging and difficult to get through. I don’t usually enjoy post-modernist novels because they often stray too far from simple story telling. They become too philosophical, too experimental and fail to adequately convey emotion. In the end, they become little more than intellectual puzzles or exercises in theory and lack (at least for me) valid human experience. The Black Book is filled with conflicting narratives and meta-fiction, which cause the reader to consistently question what he or she is reading. A man’s wife disappears, leaving behind a nondescript note. The man searches for her. His older cousin, a famous columnist, has also disappeared. The man starts looking for the cousin as well. Have they run off together? Who are these missing people? Who is the man? The overall arch of the novel is difficult to follow. But along the way many beautiful stories are told. The reader becomes steeped in the history of Istanbul, in secret societies, in radical politics, in famous poets and doppelgangers, in executioners, in mirrors, mannequins, movies and pudding shops. This is certainly a book that requires focus. I felt abandoning it more than once, often through boredom. In most works of fiction you can grasp the basic storyline and from there proceed to the underlying themes and meanings. I found myself unable to do this with this book and yet I found it extremely meaningful. The only problem is I’m not exactly sure why. Perhaps in its level of mystique or mysteriousness.","Nov 25, 2017"
97266837,Stephlynne,"Traveling to Istanbul inspired this purchase. I wanted to sample Turkish literature, and as a fan of the mystery genre, this tale of an Istanbul lawyer searching for his detective novel obsessed wife seemed right up my alley.. It turned out that this set-up was more a way of framing a story about existentialism and identity than a traditional mystery. Yet its lush descriptions of Istanbul in the early 1980's and the tension between Turkish national identity and Western influence were quite immersive and enlightening.. The book chapters alternate between the describing the protagonist Galip's search for his wife Ruya and newspaper columns written by Galip's uncle (and Ruya's half-brother) Celal.. All of the characters struggle to find their own identity while actively wishing to be someone else. There is a mysticism as well, a focus on dreams and hidden messages and signs.. As an American, without the historical, political, and philosophical background to put all of this into context, it was a somewhat challenging read at times. But I loved how the book evoked the unique charm of Istanbul.","Feb 26, 2020"
9073408,Mitra Samal,"Read this book only if you can invest time because it is a difficult read and also a lengthy one. There are hidden meanings and sometimes double meanings and you have to read between the lines. Not sure if I got few of the messages clearly. Also this book has too much details about Istanbul, it's history and sufisim or hurufism. So, much so that I had to watch a tourist video about Istanbul and read few things related to it's history and politics. The reason I would still recommend this book is it's philosophy, it greatly explores a very crucial topic that it is always difficult to be all yourself. We are greatly influenced by others and want to become like others just to be accepted by the society. Orhan Pamuk, the Nobel prize winner dares you to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to change you. According to him a person who can not be oneself or a civilization that imitates another is doomed to perish. The protagonist Galip faces this dilemma endlessly in this book while searching for his missing wife. Not an happy ending but an interesting read.","Aug 29, 2018"
10643549,Judy,"I read this book for the 2019 Popsugar Challenge category of ""A book you meant to read in 2018"". It was recommended to me by my father and sister, and I've had it on my ""to read"" list for a while. Unfortunately, I found it a very slow go, and I'm not sure I would have finished it if I weren't reading it for the challenge. It's full of long (like half a page long) sentences and very confusing to follow since the narrator and the protagonist seem to be one and the same some of the time, and not in others. It also consists of newspaper columns of a missing writer, along with ones the protagonist writes on his behalf. I will say I got a bit more interested towards the end, but the beginning was just a fog to me. Still, by the end I had raised my rating from one star to two, so I guess that's a good sign. Basically it left me feeling inadequate as a reader. My father has read it more than once, and says it improves upon repetition. Perhaps so, but I think I need to take a break for a while first.","Feb 18, 2019"
33334584,Peter Pinkney,"Stories within stories within stories. This is a complicated and difficult book, probably the most difficult that I have read all year, but it was well worth it.. Is it a detective novel?, a love story?, a quest?, or a story of loss, a loss of a wife, or the loss of a national identity?. Basically it is a story of Galip’s wife who disappears at the same time as his cousin Celal (who is also Galip’s wife’s half brother), and Galip’s search for her through looking through Celal’s newspaper columns.. It is also a search for Turkey with references to Sufism, the Ottoman Empire, and The Thousand and One Nights.. A lot darker than Elif Shafak, but equally as brilliant.. I wish that I knew more of Turkey’s history, so that I could understand more..

It explores the real art of writing and the beauty of not commercializing it, and how this goes on to affect readers and touch their conscience deeply, to the point that we as readers begin to worship writers, hoping to be able to create art and magic like THEM and in this way, lose ourselves and become THEM..

There have been many distractions to prevent reading and I soon found that I could not read more than ten pages at once - maximum. After about the first hundred pages I gave up trying to work out where we were in the plot and who was who and quickly became content to dive in and enjoy the writing and amazing imagination, almost reading it like loosely connected short stories. Having a reasonable knowledge of Istanbul and Turkey I enjoyed the settings in Istanbul and historical references - the things I didn’t know about Rumi !!

But, there's always something in here. This monumental journey of self-discovery, what it means to be oneself, true identity - I certainly didn't grasp everything, but there was a lot of food for thought.

23795634,Hafsa,Touted as one of Orhan Pamuk's best novels 'The Black Book' takes the idea of a detective novel and turns it into an almost 500 page novel about Istanbul and identity. This wasn't a bad book by any means but it's less a thriller and more of a discussion with one chapter a column by Galip/Celal and the other follows the story. If you're used to Orhan's musings then you'll enjoy this novel like I did but if not then be prepared for less action and more exposition. The actual story told on the blurb really only starts halfway through the novel and the ending was kind of predictable but it was really more about the journey. This was my second novel by Orhan Pamuk and having adored 'A Strangeness In my Mind' I wasn't floored by this but I'm eager to read more by Orhan Pamuk.,"Jun 06, 2018"

To be fair, I do think it has more to do with the Turkish language than the author itself. That said, the book is a fascinating view of Istambul and Turkey in the 80s. Plenty of historic references and a very interesting perspective on the Turkish people during that decade. Worth reading, mostly to get a sense of Turkish literature but do take it with calm as it's a hard read. Don't expect the typical narrative, but a much slower plot rhythm.","Nov 02, 2017"

I must be myself to be myself, I became the person they wanted me to be and I can’t bear the person they want me to be; if I had to be that insufferable person; I’d rather be nothing at all.”. The Black Book by Orhan Pamuk. I hope to find the words to know myself. Amidst the busying road to redemption I slowly loose myself little by little. Peals of tears would sometimes rheum my eyes but neither wind nor the sun can hide me from the truth.. If I could not be ME I’d rather be no one, I don’t adhere to belief systems or boxed perceptions that are limiting and debilitating. When I could not be ME “…I’d rather be nothing at all.” No one completes me.. I am not lost with my nationality or college affiliation as a Knoller because I am more than all these things combined. I am simply the I AM manifesting at my current form. I may not like my form now but it is what the present moment gives me. I experience the perennial difficulty of balancing my being and form. I get away from thinking to feeling but the difficulty arises when reality mirrors the truth about my weight.. When I look at my old pictures; I always say “that was me” as if I am a different person from three years ago, svelte like a kitten but now a hungry and portly boar out for a hunt. I look at my old photos in despair and sigh in disbelief that I have grown back to my old size. But in essence I am still that man in the photo of three years though aged with wisdom. I am the same man of three years ago, though much portly but defiantly better!. The illusion that I am another man of three years ago and that I was better then is a mere misjudgment of the truth; change is my only companion thus I have nothing else to do but invite the august companion to lay witness to more unfolding events.. Life is my friend, thoughts are my enemy. Life has been good but I have not been better at treating myself. Perpetual hullabaloo emerging from thinking SMALL. I must not adhere to feeling small or big because as I keep repeating, at the end of the day I would be judged by how I remain in “stillness” in the maddening day of lore.. Adhering to thinking small led me to insignificant choices. What am I afraid of? My own power? My own capacity to ignite change? I wonder when I will surrender to my power…wondering would not help, feeling lost would not do me good. Tin helped me get away from feeling and thinking SMALL. She challenged me to pass my resume to her esteemed university to teach. I was angst in wonderment because “I am not good enough” but with endless chattering, I eventually acceded to believing that I am worthy.. The “I am not…” syndrome has bit me hard that its venom has eroded my sagacious predilection for greatness. The question of “how” is not anymore important because the question of “when” precedes any other queries.. When would I become myself?. I AM already I AM thus the question of when is answered in the NOW.. “…he would never know places until he’d found what he was seeking.

The Black Book, is a great book by Turkish author and the winner of Noble Prize in Literature, Orhan Pamuk. The story is about a lawyer named Galip, who started investigating his wife, Ruya, sudden disappearance. After a while, he suspected that Ruya had run away with her stepbrother and their childhood friend, Celal,who was a famous author and newspaper columnist. In order to find them, Galip started by rereading Celal’s columns, wearing his clothes, living at his place,answering his phones and even writing new columns for the newspaper. In brief,living Celal’s life literary, the life that he was envied since he was a kid.But he got into very complicated life of Celal day by day and the story ended in a very tragic way. The main theme of the book is identity. Identity is one of the most complicated and troublesome philosophical questions that we are dealing everyday, at individual, social and national level. The main story is interspersed by reprints of Celal’s columns, which provide a platform for the author to introduce us to different aspects of complicated culture of people living in Istanbul, Turkey and also the whole Middle East. Maybe the author is right when he said, Nothing’s as strange as life – except writing!. I continued to suffer from this illness until my husband’s death. I still suffer from it, though I no longer see it as an illness; after my husband died, when I was alone with my guilt, I finally accepted that no one in this world can ever hope to be themselves. The overwhelming regret I felt was but another variation of the same disease, and so was my new passion: to relive the life I had shared with Nihat, relive it exactly, but now as myself. One dark midnight, as I warned myself that regret could ruin what time was left to me, I had an eerie thought: I had not been myself during the first half of my life because I wanted to be someone else, and now I was going to spend the second half of my life being someone else who regretted all those years she had spent not being herself. I couldn’t help but laugh, and when I did, the terror and misery I had thought to be my past and my future became a fate I shared with everyone, and a fate I had no need to dwell on. For by now I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that none of us can ever hope to be ourselves: that the troubled old man standing in that long line, waiting for the bus – he too has ghosts living inside him, ghosts of the ‘real’ people he once longed to become.That rosy-cheeked mother who’s taken her children to the park on a winter’s morning to soak in some sunlight – she too has sacrificed herself, she too is a copy of some other mother. The melancholy men straggling out of movie theaters,the wretches I saw roaming along crowded avenues or fidgeting in noisy coffeehouses – they too are haunted day and night by the ghosts of the ‘true selves’ they longed to become.","Jan 05, 2015"
27482323,Omar Taufik,"This was the 4th novel (6th book ) I read by our great author Orhan Pamuk. This novel was different than his previous novels I read with it's extreme depth & weight making it a definatly difficult read but amazing in the same time.. The plot is sometimes difficult to follow where I experienced some confusion near the end but on the other hand each chapter seems like a short mini book alone with it's interesting subjects discussed at chapter level.. The author's talent is brilliantly demonstrated in how deep he explores the human nature, in the rich detailed description of Istanbul the city & it's people's lives, in the various historical social religious subjects discussed and explained.. Identity both the at individual and nation level is the main concept explored in the book along with a long and mysterious spiritual self discovery journey where feelings of melancholy & love are also present along with lessons in life meanings.. I would like share a group of quotes I managed to capture during my reading of this rich book :. How short our lives are, how little we see, how little we know ; so let us dream, at least.. The Black Book , p 209. For what is reading but the animating of a writer's words on the silent film strip in our minds ?. The Black Book , p 268. For what did it mean to read a text if it did not mean entering into the garden of its author's memory ?. The Black Book , p321. ""If you want to turn your world upside down, all you have do is somehow convince yourself you might be someone else."". The Black Book, p 327. It's not for nothing that they say it's important to see the world through someone else's eyes from time to time. Because that's really when you can understand the mystery of life, not to mention other people's secrets.. The Black Book, p 328. ""What made the world mysterious was the second person each of us hid inside ourselves, the twin with whom we shared our lives."". The Black Book, p 339. "" To be oneself, a person must hear only his own voice, his own stories, his own thoughts ! "". The Black Book, p 419. "" Man's greatest joy is to make others resemble him "". The Black Book, p 429. "" Only when a man has run out of things to say, only when he has lost all memory of his past, his books, and memory itself, only when he has plunged into the deep silence will he hear - rising from the depths of his soul, from the infinitely dark labyrinth of his being - the true voice that will allow him to become himself "". The Black Book, p 431. "" There are pages in some books that affect us so deeply that they remain imprinted in our mind forever, not because the author has displayed extraordinary skill but because "" the stories seem to write themselves "" Because they flow by their own logic "". The Black Book, p 442. Finally ı would like to thank our author Orhan Pamuk for his great works where this novel - as mentioned by the translator at the end - was the cauldron producing the following novels written by author, which makes me look forward to reading them in the near future.","Feb 08, 2014"
1010052,John,"Galip, a young lawyer, searches for his missing wife Ruya in 1980 Istanbul. The novel is interested more in the nature of searching for meaning rather than Galip’s search. So if on the surface it’s a detective novel of sorts, underneath it explores questions of identity. How do we know who we are? What does it mean to be oneself? What is Turkish national identity, and how are East and West part of it?. Galip explores the city, obsessed with searching out and decoding signs that he thinks will lead him to his wife. His wanderings are often fascinating, and reminded me of great city novels like Our Mutual Friend or Ulysses, where the city becomes a character in its own right. My favorite sections invoke the river and dust mounds in Dickens’s London: the waters and muddy banks of the Bosphorus, and the towers of trash rising in the gaps between apartment buildings, tell stories, and hold secrets.. It’s possible that Ruya left Galip for Celal, their older relative and a famous newspaper columnist, who turns out to be missing as well. Galip pores over Celal’s columns for additional signs on the whereabouts of both. (Interspersed as individual chapters throughout the novel, the articles are about life in Istanbul, and Galip uses them for his navigation of the city.) Eventually he holes up in Celal’s apartment, looking for meaning in the objects that surround him there—dirty ashtrays, old photos, letters from fans, clothes. He begins to assume Celal’s identity, even tries to think like him. At one moment, he puzzles over one of Celal’s blank journals, full of squiggly green lines of ink. What does it mean? An ant has marched desperately up one page and down the other side when the page was turned, continuing its journey for many pages until, exhausted, it drops dead, and ends up pressed by the book. Celal had been following the circuitous path with a pen.. Problem is, I often felt like that ant. A postmodern novel about reading and writing novels, this is an exhausting book, one that sends you in every direction. There’s playfulness in the puzzles and games (“Never use epigraphs—they kill the mystery in the work!” goes the first epigraph of Chapter One; the game continues when the second epigraph plays an opposing card), but it becomes overwhelming at times, so that the book can feel like a game that just won’t end. Not always, though: the ending of Galip’s story genuinely moved me, and I looked forward to every single newspaper column, which gave me glimpses into Turkish culture and history. (If you want to read this, I’d suggest starting with translator Maureen Freely’s Afterword, which provides historical context, however brief; the novel opens nine months before a bloody coup.). Orhan Pamuk’s The Black Book? I liked it.","Apr 20, 2012"
5456705,Mindy McAdams,"I found this a difficult read, but a very rewarding one. It's not that the language is difficult, nor the vocabulary, nor the unfamiliar setting in Istanbul in 1980. What's difficult is the layers of feeling, thought, and culture through which this novel carries us, like a strong current in a sea. The structure takes a bit of getting used to: alternating chapters place us with Galip, our 40-something narrator, or in one of many newspaper columns written over many years by his uncle Celal. The two types of chapters of course refer backward and forward to one another.. To some extent the reader is not expected to understand what is going on because in one way (but only one of many), the story is a mystery. Galip's wife, Ruya, and his uncle Celal have disappeared, and Galip is searching for both of them. But all the reviews of this book that emphasize this mystery, or make parallels to the detective novels that Ruya loves to read, are looking at only one slender aspect of this multi-layered novel. It is like the sea, with layers and layers of different temperatures and density and life-forms.. Some passages absolutely carried me away -- rare for a translation. The translator's note at the end was fascinating, portraying Turkish as a most unusual language, and very challenging to render into English.. In some ways it's like the reader is going down a rabbit hole with Galip, into a kind of madness or frenzy, when he sees letters etched upon all the faces of everyone on the streets. He wants to be someone else, he becomes someone else, he wanders the twisting streets of old Istanbul in fabulous disguises (or does he only dream of doing that?), which apparently some sultan famously used to do long ago. He has loved Ruya since they were children, but it's unclear whether she has ever loved him, or even why they married at all. The columnist Celal has influenced and inspired not only Galip but apparently all of Istanbul -- his daily columns are must-reads for everyone, and they debate and complain and exalt in his stories. It's a love-hate thing -- his columns are as likely to make people angry as to inspire them.. I think reading this a second time will help me understand it better.. NOTE: The edition I read, which is copyright 2006 by translator Maureen Freely, is her SECOND version of this book. Her ""Translator's Afterword"" explains this. She worked closely with author Orhan Pamuk on her translation, and it was the third novel by Pamuk she had translated. In spite of all that, she judged the first attempt to be ""somewhat opaque,"" and so she gave it another try. This seems most unusual to me, but I can vouch for the clarity of the writing and the lyrical, seductive quality it emits.","May 14, 2015"
140203,Brian,"With strong traces of Proust in its exploration of personal memory, as well as of Dostoevsky in its creation of psychological turmoil over identity, and finally of Dinesen in its treatment of mystery and the art of story-telling, this is truly a complicated novel. That said, it is more of a psychological novel than anything else, as most of the 400-some-odd pages deal with the noise of the protagonist’s (Galip’s) thoughts as he tries to read signs and discover who he is. I found this to be more unfortunate than interesting, as the initial intrigue of the book (the disappearnce of his wife, Ruya, and her half-brother, Celal) held promise for suspense that only gets diminished as one listens to Galip go on and on about what this or that might mean and what it tells him about himself. This was interesting to begin with, but got annoyingly old before too long. (Perhaps part of the point?). That said, the central theme of this novel, the thing that is so redundant it's impossible to miss, is quite interesting: the search for one's true identity. In searching for his wife Ruya (meaning ""dream"" in Turkish), Galip gets caught up in memories of her, and takes an obsessive interest in Celal, so much that he starts becoming him. The chapters alternate between ""plot"" and Celal's (and, eventually, Galip's) journal articles, which thematically pertain to the events of the ""plot"" chapters. These journalistic chapters are fascinating (about Turkey's past and present, as well as on the nature of story-telling, among other things), and they rescue the book from excessive tedium. I could read Celal for hours a day but must tolerate Galip. Perhaps this is because Celal has a better sense of who he is than Galip?. The story can perhaps be extrapolated out to make commentary on Turkey's modern position, which is a frequent topic in Pamuk's novels (at least in two of the three I've read). That is, it can be interpreted to be about Turkey's search for its own identity; it loses itself in inner turmoil over chasing an elusive dream from its past (Ruya), and it turns to a polished, refined West (Celal, who'd spent most of his life in Germany) to listen to its criticism, as well as to emulate it. The book offers a thesis about whether or not Turkey should do this at the end, which I'll withhold for those who wish to read it. This is just a possible interpretation, of course. It also works simply on the level of the individual: one's quest for one's own identity. Overall, some very fascinating themes and ideas, but rather stunted in the middle, and it was hard to overcome that. The end feels rather whimsically wrapped up.. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if I could.","Apr 24, 2010"
2119968,Deborah Palmer,"Finally finished the book last week. As you can see from my initial reading of the book until completion the novel alternately drove me crazy and appealed to me at the same time. I believe overall Galip our subject/hero finds that writing and telling stories helps you to transcend yourself but in the end you are still you. As the expression goes, wherever you go there you are. There is always a story within the story, however Mr. Pamuk could have left out the comparisons/analysis to/of Rumi. No matter what Pamuk writes he will never be as deep yet simple as the poet Rumi.. This story like the novel Snow is not your traditional mystery. It weaves together several levels and it is really a psychological drama. My impressions thus far:. Switched Lives. One with the Beloved (Rumi). If I don't measure up then I will become you.. Swallowed up -- me as an individual ceases to exist.. Each of the chapters are vignettes, slices of melancholia, a theme that repeats itself in all of Pamuk's books. Another subject is that of assimilation whether cultural or as an individual. No more originality. Pamuk is one of those authors who creates his own worlds in his books based on his own life and upbring in Istanbul, Turkey. Actually except for maybe for his book, My Name is Red, Pamuk tends to repeat the same themes, subjects and topics over and over ad naseum! Nothing new under the sun?!. This novel leaves something to be desired. However you may like the book if you enjoy nontraditional mysteries/dramas. Cavet; Pamuk tends to repeat the same overiding themes throughout all his books. Actually his best book was the non-Fiction, Istanbul, the autobiography of his life, which really made me want to visit his country. The slices of life in Instanbul were at least enjoyable. I think all non-Western or non-European cultures have since the 18th century experienced the East vs. West and/or Christianity vs Indigenous Religions debates/controvesies. The fact that Pamuk rehases this concept in each of his books does not give the reader anything different to look forward to. In fact the dialogue can try the reader's patience with all theses ""hidden"" meanings and sublevels. Only the names/locations of the characters change. I honestly believe that Mr. Pamuk is trying to be too ""deep""!! Remember Alice in Wonderland? Well this book is turning more and more into Adult Jackerwocky. Mr. Pamuk could have left out the constant analysis and as Malcolm X said, ""Make it Plain!!""","Apr 27, 2009"
38723674,Nomentions,"We begin with family life in Instanbul, and a mystery elopement. What is the meaning behind this mystery? Pamuk goes further, what is the meaning of mystery, and what is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of Life in Istanbul? One of Pamuk's influences, Dostoyevsky wrote: ""The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for. "" In search of his version of this question, Pamuk writes like a musician who endlessly jams, starting with a phrase and aiming never to repeat himself. The theme is similar, people's incapacity to find themselves. In recursive lists, each person living in his Istanbul is named, the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker, the taxi drivers, surveyors, the sex workers, ticket takers, photographers. So many lists, that the books main character, Galip, in finding himself in the role of nationally known writer, protests his fear of receiving another endless list, this time from a character assuming the role of reader, who happens to want to be an author. In this naming of the roles, of all these characters, Pamuk collectively reveals the incapacity for the Turkish people to find themselves in the right place on the cultural spectrum of east vs west. If each person, is a story on a screen then Pamuk is looking at a thousand, or 10 thousand, or a 100 thousand screens. In Pamuk's Istanbul, the pixels on each screen become symbols, drawn from the mystic medieval Islamic world. Instanbul becomes shadowy, noir-dark, paranoid. The past is written in symbols and from this is created something like the Matrix ( that was numbers), a simulacra. But this is 1990, Pamuk is the writer who looks in the mirror and sees a picture of him writing a book in front of a mirror where another version of himself is writing a book in front of a mirror in a chain which stretches to infinity. So we watch a romantic elopement, but which mirror re we watching it in? Following the narrative is like being in an Escher puzzle, where you know the senses have been tricked but you do not understand how or why. Pamuk has lived his life in the sworling conspiracy theories that are engrained in the culture and politics of Turkey. I did not note much satire and have forgotten if the multiple ironies had any humour attached!!","May 08, 2019"
9647467,Apoorva,"Gorgeous prose, interspersed with sparkling column pieces...cheeky references to English detective novels (mostly Sherlock Holmes)...thematic complexity in the same league as Marquez & Borges...and a too-vivid, too-engrossing portrayal of Istanbul. Questions of identity, and the idea that stories are what enable us to make sense of the world...have probably been said before, but never so transcendentally. This novel is so many things at once: a collection of journals, a pseudo (postmodern?) detective story, a search for identity through the Borgesian labyrinth that is Istanbul...enchanting, exhilarating at every level. This was a book where I didn't care what the ending is going to be, since the journey had been the whole point. A giddying, refreshing & intriguing ride.. I LOVED the Hamlet motif (to be, or not to be, oneself). Even more delicious prose (WHY AM I NOT A NATIVE TURKISH SPEAKER??!) and a lingeringly, heartbreakingly beautiful final paragraph. How you can be yourself only through telling stories, and how 'Nothing is quite as surprising as life. Except may be writing. Yes, writing, writing...the only consolation'. Pamuk also makes a very powerful point about how the first step to finding yourself (your literary voice at least) is to lose yourself in others' creations. Because we're not story-creators, but story-tellers. Because the stories we tell are not new, they're refreshing retellings of the ones we've been hearing for ages. Art is not the what, but the how.. 6 stars out of five, for the most dizzying ride I've had since One Hundred Years of Solitude and Borges' Ficciones.. It has been shelved as one of those books I was reluctant to let go of, and books I keep coming back to. Mr. Pamuk, I'm in love with you. You are officially my Turkish equivalent of Marquez, Borges, Calvino & Eco.","Sep 30, 2012"
16675,martin,"This has to be one of the most difficult books I have ever read for pleasure. I wasn't sure what was happening at all for the first few chapters, then I spent much of the rest of the book trying to figure out what the ""message"" of the book might be. Finally about 3/4 of the way through, I thought I had begun to figure it out and I started to appreciate the incredible ability of the author.. My take on this novel differs a little from the standard interpretation - Wikipedia for example says it is about the creation and development of identity through story-telling. Personally, I find that a rather bland description.. Yes, there is a constant search for truth and for the ""right"" identity which will make each character fulfilled.. However, for me, The Black Book talks of a wider loss of identity and a loss of self confidence and the need to recreate and recover that confident identity - not by blindly and unquestioningly following the beliefs, customs and fashions of the West but by rediscovering the rich and diverse tradition of Istanbul and Turkey and the Turks themselves - a mixture of West and East with added spice unique to the city and its people.. Pamuk is at his best when he describes the city and her people - I sensed a fierce love for them, tempered by his sadness at the way they have lost their way. The building of faceless apartments over the remaining wealth of the various cultures creating and shaping Istanbul...... This book, like the wonders of Andalusian Granada, is a great antidote to the anti-Islamic ignorance we see so often today, but its real message seems to be for the Turks - be aware of and proud of your own identity, traditions and culture. Don't feel you need someone else to tell you who you really are","Apr 04, 2008"
5421950,Michaeljglover,"This book was a difficult read. I enjoyed his previous novels, but this one tried my perseverance; many times I wanted to give up the book. The over arching idea of the novel is the difficulty to be oneself and not someone else. Most of our thoughts, from TV, movies and writers are not our own, thus when we quote them or use them in any fashion, we become them, and not ourselves. I found the idea interesting and provocative, and this dilemma is something Pamuk, as a Turk, writes about in most of his work.. I lived in Turkey for 6 years in my youth and do understand the struggle that plague modern Turkey: as a government, to stay true to Ataturk's secular ideals and the individual, to embrace modernist ideals. The country is the link between West and East (Asia-Minor) and he government is constantly fighting to stay secular/democratic against Islamic fundamentalism. It's a constant battle and in my opinion shows a courage rare in today's political climate. The vast majority of Turks, though are Islamic and adhere to it's practices: calls to prayer, times of fasting i.e. Ramadan. What I saw and heard in my time in Turkey was that Turks want to accept western culture (read USA) but the Muslim in them rejected all the sexuality, and liberalism that comes with it. How to reconcile the two. But this is everyone's battle, not just Muslims.. I got tired of his repeating the theme to the nth degree. In fact, I got annoyed, and this is where the struggle began. His writing is wonderful and his ability to capture the random thoughts of his character is brilliant, but those refreshing scenes were lost amid loads of ""characters struggling with self issues"" scenes. It was too much for me.","Oct 01, 2011"
5019220,Maksut,"This might contain some spoilers!. Now I'm left with mixed feelings about the book. Maybe it's because Orhan Pamuk intentionally left some of its pages 'dark' for readers' imagination. Or it's simply because my attention span is not enough to follow intellectual details or philosophical riddles.. To note, as a native speaker, I've read Turkish original version and this is the first novel of Pamuk that I've read. I'd like to think of myself at least familiar with some of the famous characters, historical anecdotes that are seen in the book. So unlike some of the commentators here, I don't think ""losing interest at some point"" is because of a translation problem due to national aspects of the book. Make no mistake, I've loved the setup and reading the articles of Cemal on every other chapter. Some of these articles are beautiful which remind fictions of Borges'. But it takes effort to keep up with the book, it really feels full. Orhan Pamuk likes to mess your mind with problem of identity, backward references, connecting little stories with a meta story in a puzzling way (I've found out this after reading the book but this meta story itself is incidentally a modern remake of Husn-u Ask). And he does all of this while picturing the life of Istanbul with dark streets, ugly apartments, hidden wells. He also changes his style unexpectedly, at some point he jumps out from being a narrator and starts to talk with reader directly (this was a startling experience, makes you feel suddenly 'exposed' to the author just in front of you).. Overall, if you can effort some mind-boggling, the black book is definitely worth the time spent with it. I might reread it after a couple of years and a couple of Pamuk's other novels.","Oct 04, 2011"
19244473,Paul Clement,"I really enjoyed Black Book by Orhan Pamuck, a Turkish writer who lives in Istanbul. I really enjoyed the book for the breadth of its themes and the way Pamuck draws such a convincing cityscape.. The novel is a mystery about the simultaneous disappearance of Ruya, Galip bey’s wife, and Celal, Galip and Ruya’s cousin. It begins on the morning of Ruya’s disappearance. Galip goes to work and returns to find her gone having left a short note in green ink. He later is unable to discover his cousin, Celal, and realises that he too is missing.. So begins a journey through the streets of Istanbul to track them both down, sometimes resembling a detective novel, but it is far more than this, as Istanbul itself is described in fantastic detail through lists of its endless features.. The chapters are interspersed with columns written by Celal for a daily newspaper over his writing career. These are full of stories ranging from descriptions of gangsters to historical executioners. In fact stories are a major theme in the book. They include people’s personal stories and the fictions they weave about them from such influences as western movies and religious figures.. Other themes include self image and being oneself. He quotes and adds to Hamlet: “To be, or not to be oneself. That is the question” and Galip’s journey allows him to eventually take the place of Celal in writing his column.. It is packed full of detail, and has been compared to Rabelais’ use of comic lists, but the range of Pamuck’s writing leaves a lot to be studied and critically analysed. It is a very enjoyable book with masses to think about and reflect upon.","Apr 14, 2013"
39995086,James Pyott,"I started reading this magnificent book, never having read anything of Pamuk previously, on holiday in Greece as it was on a bookshelf in the house where i was staying.. The translation was a different one; an american edition translated by Guneli Gun. I was completely drawn in to the world portrayed in the book, and was determined to read everything Orhan Pamuk had written. I left the book on the shelf when I returned to blighty, thinking i would get a copy when I got home. However when I looked for the book in England I discovered that only the translation by Maureen Freely was available. I started on that, but sadly the magic I had experienced from the other translation did not appear on the pages of the Freely edition. I have just searched again on amazon as I write this and I can see there is now a kindle version of the Guneli Gun translation available. Perhaps I didn't have the Kindle last time I looked. I'm just writing this to illustrate how important the translation is; it may be simply a matter of personal taste of course; perhaps there are many people who prefer the Maureen Freely version. My point is really just how different different translations can be. [Later that same day] Having tried now to buy the kindle edition, it became unclear which edition i was actually buying when i clicked on a thumbnail of the gun translation and it led me to a kindle edition of the Freely one; Amazon doesn't seem to regard the translator as an significant variable, appearing only to take into account the title and the author, apart from the format of course..

7508838,Sabeena,"When I was about 7 or 8, I used to leaf through some of my dad's books on circuits and electrical connections. Pages and pages of little diagrams and grids; nothing that really made any sense to me at that age. But for some reason I was transfixed by the tiny images and little details. Page after page I would just 'read' through these books with some sort of fascination.. That's exactly how I felt reading through The Black Book. Perhaps because its my first 'detective' novel so-to-speak, I didn't know if I was going to be able to handle the track of a detective plot its is outside of my comfort zone after all. However, there was more to it than that. Pamuk is the master of detail. He is painfully precise in his description. He will not let the smallest detail go, he needs for you to know about it. You will be delighted by his micro- and macro-scopic detail for places, things, people ad events.. It had the darkness of a Dostoevsky novel which I welcomed too, being a fan of all FD writings.. Maureen Freely's translation is astonishingly good. You will never believe that its a translation; every detail and sentiment careful and precise.. It can be read again.... and probably reread many times; like I said, the detail is delightful. The beginning and ending is unimportant here. The body of the work is outstanding..

18847085,Hani,"It is the biggest book of Orhan Pamuk at 461 pages. This is one of the author's first works. Rather than the mystery it is about the 'story within the story' like Alif Laila or A Thousand And One Nights. The character of Celal (pronounced: Jelal) Salik is present in other novels of the author but here he is one of the main characters. A character of great literature, an invention of a wild imagination; Celal Salik. Nevertheless, the stories i like the most are these;. When the Bosphorus dries up. Bedii Usta's Children. We're all waiting for him. AND THESE TWO ARE THE CRÈME DE LA CRÈME OF THE FANTASTIC STORIES;. Can't you sleep?. The executioner and the weeping face. Recommended if you have read the author's magnificent novels that are more ""famous and easy-to-read"". (This novel is at times obsessively detailed, more so than The Museum Of Innocence due to the storyline..). One of the shocks i got was when i read the Translator's Afterword as it was the same voice as of the author's! And i wonder that where, what and how much is lost in translation? (Notwithstanding, Maureen Freely has done a great translation). If you read this novel beware: there will come a time when you might come to look for words in your face!

877155,Ellen,"I enjoyed My Name is Red and Snow, but I don't remember them and can't tell you what happened in them. Orhan Pamuk reminds me of a Turkish cross between Dickens and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, although grounded in a morose reality. I am not entranced by him, but feel entrenched in the deep layers of endless language, the endless rigamorale in the heads of his characters. He is a writer I have wanted to love, but who I find tiresome. His endless layered circling is too similiar, perhaps, to what many a mind goes through on a typical day, but he dilineates it more succinctly. That which is not succinct he recreates in great detail. Personally, it is like hanging out with someone who does what I metnally do to the most extreme degree, and I feel smothered by a quality I am frustrated in myself. I so wish for the quiet mind, and Orhan Pamuk has made an art of explicitly showing the inner mechanics of the unquiet mind. That said, he is brilliant, and fills his pages with details, and for anyone interested in Turkey, and Istanbul in particular, he is a fabulous resource. I just don't want to try to like him anymore. I regret it, though, he has a lot to offer the right reader. I am just not that reader.","Feb 05, 2008"
5894472,Kaleidoscopic ,"The Black Book isn't an easy read by any means, and whilst it sealed Pamuk's reputation as a brilliant author in his home country of Turkey, for the Western reader, it probably isn't the best book to start with if you are un-initiated to Pamuk's writing. It requires quite a lot of concentration, but is worth the effort, as the pace picks up in the second half as the main character, Galip, becomes consumed in locating his missing wife, Ruya and his missing journalist Uncle, Celal. Galip slowly assumes aspects of his Uncle's identity, merging his own thoughts with those of his uncle's as he reads old newspaper columns, trying to decipher clues to his Uncle and wife's location.. Translated from Turkish, it may loose some of the magic of the original where there is only one word for 'he', 'she' and 'it', and therefore the narrator's voice would be more ambiguous. Having said that, there are moments where the poetry and imagery of Pamuk's language is brilliantly captured by Freely's translation. Still, Pamuk perfectly merges traditional folklore with modern day life in Istanbul as we read through newpaper collumns written by Celal and as we follow Galip's trials in the modern day.","Jul 27, 2011"
4914294,Roberta,"This is a very good book. Even if the second part is not as good as the first.. Galip is a lawer whose wife disappear at the same moment of her half-brother Calal.. The narration of Galip's quest is interwoven with articles written by Calal for a newspaper. Both the search and the articles do not really help finding the disappeared characters but are means to discover the city of Istanbul and its most characteristic citizens.. In the first part of the book this ploy work perfectly. But in the second the story get slower: Galip goes into the Calal's flat and reads and look at every note and piece of paper inside the house.. The psicology of the characters is what makes special this book. They fill their lives with Calal's articles because, at least in my opinion, they are the subject of conversation common to the whole family. They are all uncertain of their identity and desire to be others. The idea of wanting of being another person (or themselves) is the main teme not only of Calal's article but of the whole novel itself. While Galip and most of the characters want to be Calal, Calal wants to be an idealized version of himself.. The book does not answer the question of how to be themselves, as it should not because there is no answer.","Nov 01, 2011"
5317566,Kathy B,"My first thought was to shout ""Ta-DAH!"" I did it! I finally finished this book. AND...I am giving it 4, yes, 4 stars! Laurie, after this I no longer owe Under The Volcano...this was enough of a sufferfest! That brings to mind the question, why did I give it 4 stars? 2 reasons as follows: 1) the writing, particularly in the last 160 pages, was breathtakingly beautiful. I would re-read those pages again in a heartbeat. 2) I learned a lot about Turkey...mainly thanks to a different reviewer who suggested I learn some history about Turkey, Istanbul, and their military history before finishing the book. That advice proved to be invaluable. While I never did fully understand Ruya's disappearance (and I am hoping someone who did can explain it to me!) I found the writing and stories to be amazing. I would suggest that anyone wanting to tackle this book 1) read the afterword first and 2) learn some 20th century Istanbul history first...it will make the book more meaningful. I am not going to lie, though...pages 160-300 were very tedious and could, for the most part, be eliminated from the book and you wouldn't miss anything. If it wasn't for the last 160 pages, the rating for this book would be lower!","Mar 27, 2014"
436675,Erin,"The Black Book was not an easy novel for me to get through. I always felt lost while reading The Black Book, though by the end I started to think maybe that was the point. I’m sure I could read The Black Book five more times before even beginning to scratch its dense, dark surface.. The Black Book tackles some pretty hefty themes: identity, memory and forgetting, history, and meaning. Mirrors, doubles, and copies are everywhere. It’s tough to tease the thread of one theme out of the tangle of the story; they stick together, melting into one another, forming a murky, amorphous mass. As Galip knocks against them, the structure and style of The Black Book ensures that the reader is right there beside him. I spent most of the book stuck in the same fog of confusion through which Galip was desperately fighting for clarity.. The Black Book was one of the harder books I’ve taken on recently. I cannot say I loved it; it’s more that I feel I’ve accomplished something by finishing it.. My full thoughts are posted on. Erin Reads.","Nov 11, 2010"
1156396,L,"By the description this is a mystery. I suppose there is that, but it doesn't seem to be what the book is all about, so I haven't added that label. Perhaps when I get further into it that will become more dominant. I'm not sure where this tale is going, but I'm enjoying the journey. Because I've never read a novel set in Istanbul, I'm finding the depiction of that culture, well a part of it, fascinating.. And now I'm taking a pause from the book. It's become very--what is the best descriptor?--maybe interior, maybe identity focused, I don't know. I just know that it's driving me a bit nuts, so I'm moving to sci fi for the moment. I hope this doesn't turn into abandonment; I like the characters.. Well, given that I haven't picked up this book in months, I have to recognize that I've abandoned it. I did like the characters, but the turn toward the internal was not for me. I could hang onto it, in the hope that one day I'd again turn to it or I can donate it to the library, where others will have access to it. I think the latter option makes more sense.","Jul 07, 2008"
577893,GeekChick,"This is a tale of mystery and identity -- and self-identity. Pamuk does a masterful job interweaving parallel stories. I don't want to spoil anything, so that's all I'll say about that.. As all Pamuk's work, the story is set in Istanbul. If you've ever been there, it will be an added bonus as you read!. I did not like the middle part of the story, however. It seemed to drag on and on and on....all of a sudden the main plot stopped moving. I really hate that; it's caused me to dislike many a book. The reason for this is that Pamuk is explaining some of the philosophical underpinnings of the story. Pamuk is a great writer and I will always love him, but really, there was no excuse to leave the main plot hanging like that. I know, I know -- it was supposed to show the main character's inner changes, but still. It bored me.. Other than that, I enjoyed the book enough to recommend it. I would not call this a mystery in the conventional sense, though it is somewhat classified as such. It's more a philosophical journey about what identity means.","Aug 12, 2008"
7769951,Barry King,"The translator's afterward begins ""There is no verb. to be. in Turkish, nor is there a verb. to have. . It's an agglutinive language, which means that root nouns in even the simplest sentences can carry five or six suffixes. (""Apparently, they were inside their houses"" is a single word.) There are many ore tenses—you use one mode for events you have witnessed with your own eyes, for example, and another for anything you know by hearsay. There is a special syllable you can add to a verb to emphasize the active role someone played in whatever you are describing. The passive voice is as graceful as the active voice and rather more popular, with the result that a fine Turkish sentence may choose to obscure exactly who did what...."". I can't think of a better way to sum up this book. Beautiful language ensconced in an ambiguous point of view by a narrator that is not so much unreliable as unidentifiable, a mystery to himself.","Feb 28, 2012"
5078164,Shashank Kumar,"It is the usual, dense, layered writing from one of my favorite authors. It is usual in the sense that the bedrock and even the humus of the story is the collage of modern and ancient Turkey. The density is rich - there are very few shallow people, almost no shallow subplot and surely not a single shallow line. The layers accompany almost every character - the man, the moment and the history all intertwine through the lines. One of my favorite parts is where the author describes Aladin's gift shop and its old shopkeeper. At that point, the novel slowly slips into a commentary on the current consumerist culture without losing its context and also without being completely biased. The narrative is slow but the details make it completely worth it. On the flip side though, I generally feel that I have missed something in a book when I read a translation instead of the original and that feeling lingers even through this book.","Jun 18, 2012"
18668592,Kaustav Ganguly,"Pamuk's journey of Istanbul and its stories take us on a poignant trip around the town where tension is brewing and the life is anything but smooth. Galip is trying to be someone else in order to solve a mystery but he does not know that this transformation through perusals of old writings and revolving in riddles inside riddles would probably result in him assuming that life forever. Tales are told and we glimpse the legacy of Celal Salik every alternate chapter and from somewhere deep within a view of Turkey from Pamuk's study window. If only I knew Istanbul I would have understood more meanings. I would read this again for sure.. I would maintain that Pamuk's later work, Snow, is better than this but nonetheless The Black Book sets a stage for an ordinary mystery of an ordinary husband and an ordinary columnist and of its own accord develops into an extraordinary mystery culminating quietly in all its poignant glory.","Aug 25, 2014"
1040878,Joje,"I will come back to a fuller review, I hope, but it is an experience, to say the least.. The superb images that take chapters to develop move into metaphor, I think it could be called, thanks to some amazing lists. They twist and intertwine throughout the collections of stories that are the basis of the full story thanks to the characters who are all exploring what Istanbul (and Turkey) and they themselves are.. The contrast between the man who adapts the mannequins from the west to create Turkish equivalents, which are then forced to fill up underground passages like in the Paris catacombs or the story of the prince who did not make it to being the last sultan reverberates oddly in my own much simpler reality, even though the details are very different.. Sure, it took a long time to read. All the better for me, since it was much too rich to lap up at top speed, but then I have been more taken with the present US election oddities. Yes, you bet there are echoes there, too!","Oct 22, 2016"
36302605,Peter B,"I cannot over-emphasise my disappointment with this, my first, Orhan Pamuk book. I was inspired by Alan Yentob's Imagine programme and thought this was the one to start with. I was expecting a great read. What I got was a flow of language that suggested an inability to ignore any detail, idea or qualifying word that entered the writer's head. It was like being given twenty noisy biscuit tins crammed with costume jewellery and being asked to examine every clasp, facet of coloured glass, chain link and bead. I gasped for an elegant sentence, for space, for emotional weight and genuine intrigue. I would suggest publishing an edited version to complement the ""director's cut"" - edited by someone familiar with the convoluted detail, sense of location, characters and rhythms of James Joyce, the surrealism, surprise and humour of Flann O'Brien, and the philosophical intelligence and wit of Samuel Beckett.","Sep 21, 2018"
55792949,Tejas,"The Black Book. by Orhan Pamuk, translated by Maureen Freely. Published by Vintage (2006). Rating: ****. As an exposition of Turkish culture, only the Turkish or individuals with intricate knowledge of the Mediterranean nation’s history can comment on the accuracy of The Black Book. I do not claim to be an expert in this field. As a result, my comments on Turkishness are restricted to plot points which stood out to me. Nonetheless, it is impossible to read Pamuk, even the translated version, and miss his identity and the influence of his surroundings on the book.. The Black Book opens with rhe protagonist, Galip, finding that his wife/first cousin Rüya has left him. Over the course of the novel, he attempts to hunt her down in Istanbul – suspecting that she has taken off with her half-brother, Celal, a columnist..

4104059,Barry,"I thought this book began well, dragged through the middle, and almost died at the end; however, the final chapter was really good. I wish the translator's note was at the beginning, and I wish it wasn't so redundant. I know content matches form here, but at some point it gets tiresome. I also feel like something is lost (as always) in translation, that there are tropes, allusions, and other devices that I miss because the book is mainly Turkish. That being said, I loved the setting within a culturally torn city and the continual East-West dialogues, seeing as Istanbul has been in that special historical and geographical position.. Ok, so after that pretentious review, I may recommend it. Three stars normally means ""worth it"" for me, which I do if for no other reason than its insight into another culture and its excellent internal parallels.","Jul 22, 2011"
18458787,Beenish Khan,"What I like best about Pamuk's work is his nostalgic memories and description of Istanbul, stories within stories and a very strong usage of folklore and religious stories. And while this book has all that, it just doesn't have a good story. It's a post-modern work where protagonist's wife has run away from home and instead of filing a report with Police or informing his relatives, he goes on and walk around Istanbul every night coming across different experiences. In the end I want to read a good story, which the book didn't offer.. A very slow read and Dostovesky's influence is very prominent. Apart from that the theme of identity and everyone wanting to be somebody else is repeated over and over, it gets to a limit where you just don't care.. In the end, I appreciate what was written but I just didn't like it.","May 12, 2013"
8149629,Jyothsna,"A rare and definite re-read. The Black Book left me with this vague feeling that I knew what the author was talking about and yet there was something he was trying to convey that I completely missed. It is both and attractive and annoying feeling to have about a book. It is a feat that so many seemingly column style chapters could be strung together to form a coherent book.. The book loosely ties Ruya's detective novel obsession to the actual book, but nothing substantial. Reading the book and considering the message the author Pamuk was trying to convey at the end, maybe this was the intended effect. I give The Black Book 4 stars because I am baffled by it, but not entirely put off. A re-read might affect the rating in either a positive or negative way.","Sep 30, 2015"
11577219,Vishali,"The basic premise of the book circles around Galip, a lawyer in search of his wife, Ruya and his cousin Celal, a columnist. He wanders through the streets of Istanbul to find a clue of her whereabouts and in the process Galip embarks on a search of his own identity. The city Istanbul is central to the plot and the reader is given insights about its culture, history, beliefs, faith and socio political ideologies.. I like stories which have history embedded in the narrative and I picked up this book for the same reason (apart from the fact that Orhan Pamuk is a controversial Turkish writer and a Nobel laureate).. P. S it has a wafer thin convoluted plot and is not an easy read. Some parts of it were extremely tedious.","Feb 13, 2017"
1434745,Diane,"I shouldn't say I read this book, because I only got about a quarter of the way into it. I kept trying and trying but just could not get past feeling irritated by its mysteries instead of intrigued. At first I thought the irritation had to do with multiple digressions, too many details and objects and place names and historical factoids, or theories, or whatever they were - but eventually I realized there was no there there. It's like a Borges tale with logorrhea. I guess it's one of those books developing writers sometimes need to write to get to the good stuff, as I count My Name Is Red among my favorites. Relieved I finally gave up and took it back to the library.","Sep 06, 2013"
653699,Jennifer Provorse,"Even if you don't have time to read the entire book, every other chapter is an individual article. So, really, you can avoid the entire mysterious storyline and still get a taste of Pamuk's fantastic story telling...even if he is just copying from the past!

Or am I just mad?!","Mar 06, 2008"
1584024,Nathan,"This is a preliminary rating, I think this book (like all of Pamuk's work I have encountered) will require a few more reads before I can come to a definite conclusion. But I think the rating can only go up.. A very surreal writing style that at times reminded me of Murakami's work on The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, in an vague/abstract sort of way. Conjures up very emotional, vivid imagery, and provides some important food for thought on the concept of identity.. Recommended.","Apr 14, 2009"

But I'm abandoning it for now because I find myself unable to bear yet another outing of the trope where a man seeks an enignmatic, elusive woman -- in this case, Galip's wife Ruya, who has disappeared.

614778,Ahmad Sharabiani,"Beyaz Kale = The White Castle, Orhan Pamuk. The story begins with a frame tale in the form of a preface written by historian Faruk Darvinoglu (a character referenced in Pamuk's previous book, Silent House) between 1984 and 1985, according to the fictional dedication to the character's late sister at the beginning of the frame tale. Faruk recalls finding the story that follows in a storage room while looking through an archive in the governor's office in Gebze, among old bureaucratic papers. He takes the transcript, fascinated by its presence in such a place. During his breaks from work, he begins trying to find a source for the tale, hoping to authenticate its events and author. He is able to connect the author to Italy, but is unable to make any further progress. An acquaintance tells him that manuscripts such as the one he found could be found throughout the many old, wooden houses of Istanbul, mistaken for ancient Korans, and left venerated and unread. With some encouragement, he decides to publish the manuscript. The preface ends with Faruk noting that the publisher chose the title of the book, and a remark on the nature of modern readers will try to connect the dedication to his sister to the tale that follows.. عنوانها: دژ سفید؛ قلعه سفید؛ نویسنده: اورهان پاموک؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه آوریل سال 2003 میلادی. عنوان: دژ سفید؛ نویسنده: اورهان پاموک؛ مترجمها: فرهاد سخا، علی کاتبی؛ مشخصات نشر: تهران، نشر مرغ آمین، 1377، در 168 ص، شابک: 9645519195؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ترک، ترکیه، سده 20 م. ک‍ت‍اب‌ در س‍ال‌ 1377 هجری شمسی، با ع‍ن‍وان‌: «ق‍ل‍ع‍ه‌ س‍ف‍ی‍د»؛ و ب‍ا ت‍رج‍م‍ه‌: ارس‍لان‌ ف‍ص‍ی‍ح‍ی‌، ت‍وس‍ط: نشر ق‍ق‍ن‍وس‌ نیز، م‍ن‍ت‍ش‍ر ش‍ده‌ اس‍ت‌. رخدادها، در استانبول سده ی هفدهم میلادی روی می‌دهند. داستان درباره ی یک مرد دانشمند ایتالیایی ست، که قصد سفر دریایی، از: ونیز به ناپل، را دارد، که توسط ناوگان امپراطوری عثمانی بازداشت، و زندانی، و به بردگی، گرفتار می‌شود. نخست در خطر اعدام است، اما مردی به نام استاد (هوجا یا همان خواجه)، که شباهت زیادی به او دارد، ایشان را به عنوان برده، می‌خرد. دانشمند ونیزی، به استاد، که از نزدیکان سلطان است، برای پیدا کردن ارج و قرب، نزد پاشا، یاری می‌کند. آندو به سلطان معرفی می‌شوند، تا با یاری مرد ایتالیائی اسلحه ی آهنین قدرتمندی بسازند. رمان، از سویی، تاریخ رویارویی امپراطوری عثمانی با اروپایی‌ها را به تصویر می‌کشد، و از سوی دیگر، یک قصه است. «پاموک» در آفرینش این اثر، که او را یک نویسنده ی جهانی کرد، از تاریخ، و فرهنگ، و آیین پیشینیان خود، الهام گرفته است؛ و چگونگی پیشرفت علم، در دنیای آن روزگار را، به مخاطبان و خوانشگران امروزی نشان داده است. ا. شربیانی","Aug 10, 2010"
5022264,"Ian ""Marvin"" Graye","A Short Start. I started reading this novel, because it was Pamuk's shortest and although I liked the subject matter of his other novels, I was worried I might bite off more than I could chew (I am the sort of person who must finish a book once I've started it, even if I hate it). So this was a taster for me.. From A to B Inevitably. I think it is fair to say that what happens at the end is inevitable. His craftsmanship lies in how he achieves it.. There is a moment towards the end of the book when the door opens and we're suddenly on the other side of the story.. Only we have to look back over our shoulder and think, how did I get here?. From A to B Predictably. It annoys me when people criticise a book, because they think it is predictable. Everything is predictable to someone, if not necessarily me, because I didn't see it coming. (I am not a big fan of prediction. I don't see the point.). From A to B Enjoyably. But even if it is predictable, the skill is in the journey, the telling.. It's like a joke, or life or sex, we all know what the end is, it's what happens between now and then that matters.. Something similar might have happened to us all, it's the little differences that matter.","Feb 22, 2011"
8934711,Paola,"Warning: you have to relax to read this book, just let go and let it take you where it wants.. This is a novel on identity: the plot really does not matter (is this the defining feature of good literature?), the crucial point is how two individuals actually become one, to the point that we no longer know ourselves who is whom.. Is the Italian slave really taking the place of his ""hoja"" (i.e. master, according to Adam Shatz in the London Review of Books), are they really swapping lives as previously fantasised?. Or is this really a fantasy in itself, of the Turk, the Hoja, so disappointed with his fellow Turks, so disgusted with their intellectual inferiority, with their passiveness, with their lack of imagination, so much craving for the intellectually stimulating life that he can just barely perceive through the bearing, knowledge and stories of his learned slave, that he decides to live this swapped fantasy himself, willing himself to believe that he is no longer the Hoja, but the Italian former slave?. The conclusion I want to believe is the latter - it is the Italian that really flees the siege of the White Castle, and who knows whether he ever reached his native land - and maybe good for him if he did not, what could have come out of such an impossible readjustment? Or maybe, it is Hoja himself who killed him on that fateful night, with such quintessentially unreliable narrator we will never really know.. But I like to think that having finally reached that zenith he had been aspiring too for so many years, accepting the inevitable debacle was too much to bear, and finding comfort in living a dream nobody could take away from him almost unescapable.. A great read.","Aug 10, 2014"

I don't know how to write a review for such a book!. I'm sure it deserves more than 3 stars cause it's a unique and one of a kind story but I haven't enjoyed it that much. The ending was vague as were the characters. sometimes I thought the character Hoja was mentally disturbed and sometimes I thought he was a genius.. as for his look alike, the slave who actually the story was about. he was brilliant. sometimes driven by his own emotion but he had something about him that made him superior to Hoja. perhaps it was his honesty.. this book left me with mixed emotion.. it's basically about a Turkish Muslim Scholar and his Christian Italian Slave who refuses to convert to Islam. The Master and his Slave look exactly alike!. they spend all of their time together. they develop a weird bond between friendship and brotherhood.. ""I loved him, I loved him the way I loved that helpless, wretched ghost of my own self I saw in my dreams, as if choking on the shame, rage, sinfulness, and melancholy of that ghost, as if overcome with shame at the sight of a wild animal dying in pain or enraged by the selfishness of a spoilt son of my own. and perhaps most of all I loved him with the stupid revulsion and stupid joy of knowing my self""","Mar 21, 2017"

16737952,Jelena,"Well, this was unexpected. And, to be honest, I had no valid argument to expect what I expected, but still… Somehow I thought this would be a plot-based story or a novella focusing on a particular, specific event. Maybe the beginning just slightly reminded me of “Devil’s Yard” (I. Andrić).. In the 17th century, after a pirate raid, a young Venetian intellectual is brought to Istanbul as a prisoner and begins living in a Hoca’s home shortly after that. The nature of his captivity though is not to be a servant or slave, but a scientific and scholarly exchange between the Hoca and the foreigner from the West. Apart from two or three breakpoints, that is about as much as there is to palpable events. Still, the novel is very dense and rich in substance, even to a point that it reads somewhat dragging and slowly, demanding high focus and attention.. Believing himself surrounded by ignorants and idiots, the Hoca wants to learn about Western discoveries and achievement. He is vain and ill-tempered. The Venetian, the narrator of this story, is arrogant, holier-than-thou, pretentious. And that is quite a coup. Both of the protagonists are highly irritating and unlikable, thus preventing an emotional connection, an alliance between reader and character. The emphasis is on their interaction, their differences and the distance between them, their link as Doppelgänger and their pouring into each other. The motif of the identical twin represents their relation quite poignantly: How valuable and how safe is one’s own identity? What is identity at all? What makes you who you are and what would make you give that up? How is it possible you steadily flow into someone else? And when you realise a change occurring in you, do you hang on to what was previously there or do you let yourself glide with the new condition, trade places, become your own alter ego? And what if you can no longer tell yourself and your twin apart, but someone else still can? And maybe the most essential dilemma in this novel: For how long will you be able to distinguish with certainty that your own self is still yours and what your self was to begin with?. This is not the first time that Pamuk tackles the question of identity. The matter of originality and canon in art in “My Name is Red” eventually comes down to identity as well. And the relation between East and West, Orient and Occident, is not a novelty either. But this time there is barely a broader context, the social, political, historical basis is merely a setting. If I was to visualise “The White Castle”, I could easily reduce it to a single scene of two people sitting in a dark, candle-lit room with the door and window-shutters closed. This definition, loss, trade and gain of identity is about as personal as it gets. And, interestingly enough, equally unemotional and detached.","Sep 22, 2015"
55869864,Ksenia,"""The White Castle is a colorful and intricately patterned triumph of the imagination."" - said the annotation. But I don't see The White Castle as a triumph. It's good but nothing more.. Pamuk tells us a story about a slave who inspite all diffuculties and troubles took his place in the turkish society of masters and a master who seemed to be insane and genious at the same time. They are similar like brothers and their mind had become similar, too. Knowledge of the Slave became a part of Hoja. Hoja's enthusiasm became a part of the Slave. Not only readers but also they could hardly say where he ended and where started another one.. The main idea is that human heart has no limits. People can sacrifice themselves to save another human being. The fact that Hoja and the narrator exchanged their lives proves that.","Sep 04, 2017"
1533440,Al Bità,"It is almost impossible to talk about this book without revealing its ending (or at least what one might consider to be its ending). This strange work purports to be a 17th century manuscript found by one Faruk Darvinoglu in 1982. We find that in the manuscript we are about to read, '... some events described in the story bore little resemblance to fact', although the 'truth' of the general knowledge of the period seemed to be accurate (p.2). On page 3 Faruk reveals that a professor he had consulted tells him that 'in the old wooden houses on the back streets of Istanbul there were tens of thousands of manuscripts filled with stories of this kind'. Faruk tells us that the manuscript we are about to read is his own rendition into contemporary Turkish. He then writes: 'Readers seeing the dedication at the beginning may ask if it has a personal significance. I suppose that to see everything as connected with everything else is the addiction of our time. It is because I too have succumbed to this disease that I publish this tale.' The dedication he refers to is: 'For Nilgun Darvinoglu/ a loving sister/(1961—1980).' One presumes, therefore, that this dedication is by Faruk, not Pamuk (or is it?). In between this dedication and Faruk's Preface is a quotation allegedly from Marcel Proust (with no reference as to where in Proust's work this quotation is to be found) but with the qualification 'from the mistranslation of Y. K. Karaosmanoglu'. All this is in the beginning before the actual story itself... We are obviously in some murky territory here.... The manuscript itself is a rather straightforward telling of a strange tale, told by an unnamed Italian narrator about his capture by Turks, and his adventures in Istanbul where he becomes the servant of/collaborator with one Hoja (a name which apparently means 'master') who is a few years older than him, but who apparently looks exactly like the narrator. The first ten chapters details almost obsessively the relationship between the narrator and his 'double', a kind of love/hate relationship, where gradually the differences between the two men become indistinguishable, until, at the end of chapter ten, when the assault on the Polish Doppio Castle (the White Castle of the Title) fails, and Hoja dons the narrator's clothes and identity and disappears from the story. Hoja becomes the Italian; the Italian becomes Hoja. It is from these ten chapters that all the 'discussion' about self-identity, self/other distinctions, slave/master relationships, and even the relationship between East and West derive from: but I would suggest that these come more from the readers than from the novel itself. By the way, is it just a 'concidence', or merely an example of seeing everything connected to everything else, that the name of the White castle is 'Doppio' (the Italian word for 'double')?. It is really only in the final chapter (Chapter eleven) that one becomes embroiled in the complex literary trap that this novel really is, for it is here that the distinctions between the two men are, I believe, deliberately blurred, so that in the end one is no longer sure who is who. Stories of 'Hoja' as the Italian are referred to; narratives by the Italian, which point out his ignorance of Italian cities are cited; 'Hoja' is referred to as He and Him (with capital letters), and the sultan refers to Him as being the Italian captive while he is talking to the Italian (believing him to be Hoja) — or does he? The narrator, whoever he is, also seems to think his Childhood memories, exchanged with Hoja earlier, are indeed his own. There are numerous puzzling associations and confusions in this final chapter, and they all resonate with the general undermining of the narrative provided in the Preface by 'Faruk'.. A complex example is provided on page 141 of my Faber 2009 paperback edition: The Italian (?) narrator is wishing that he might once more dream of 'my childhood in Edirne' (which is supposed to be Hoja's childhood) '... of the first time I saw Him (Hoja(?)) unbearded at the pasha's door, of the chill down my spine.' Going back to the beginning of Chapter two, we are told that 'The resemblance between myself and the man [Hoja] who entered the [pasha's] room was incredible! It was *me* there...'; then later in the paragraph: 'Then I decided he didn't resemble me all that much, he had a beard;...' So there is no way, really, that we can even say that the overriding images of the similarity of the two men more or less insisted upon throughout nine chapters is anything more than a delusion of the narrator... or if not, is Hoja bearded or unbearded? Any attempt to unravel the unravellable is bound to frustration. There is no way anyone will be able to find out. The novel resolves itself into a trick which, because of its paradoxical nature, cannot be resolved: so many of the images of the novel remain in the mind, never finding any peaceful resolution. This also means that any arguments about self/other, slave/master and East/West are also not able to be resolved. Whether this is a good thing is not is problematical (precisely because of its internal paradoxes).. The final image of an old man, looking out through a window to his garden, remembering, is perhaps the best image to rest on at the end. It is a sad image, a suggestion that our memories are only what we make of them, of the narratives we tell ourselves — these are what ultimately provide us with meaning, regardless of whether they are true or not.","Nov 07, 2010"
1405967,Lavinia,"Pamuk’s talent for storytelling is definitely unquestionable. Well, OK, you can disagree, I don’t care.. I loved the setting; it was basically the main criteria for choosing the book (I’d probably need to mention the reader-friendly length, as well). I loved the plot (the double / the identical twin, the capacity of exchanging not only identities, but also memories, ideas and beliefs), the framing device, the (unreliable) 1st person narrative, the mind games and the twisted relationship / brutal conflict / love between Hoja and the slave and the cultural confrontation (West VS East).. I definitely loved Luminita Munteanu’s translation. She’s the exclusive translator of Pamuk’s books in Romanian and she’s done an incredibly good job, not only translating, but also offering a huge deal of Ottoman background – for. My Name Is Red. , at least – and explanatory footnotes. It rarely happens that I really appreciate translations, but when I read a book that sounds so naturally Romanian to me, it’s a good translation, don’t you think? Well, all those words of Turkish origin that we have in Romanian helped a lot, as well. Actually, thank goodness for all the influences Romanian has got over the years – I would never, NEVER read a Russian (or other Slavic language), Hungarian or Turkish book in English if the Romanian version was available. OK, I’m getting weird, let’s move on.. So, apparently, I liked the book; a comparison to. My Name Is Red. seems inevitable, hence the 3*. I’m not sure if it was the slow pace or something else, but somewhere after the middle I felt Pamuk lost me, the book was getting nowhere and I was tempted to abandon it. The reader is actually advised to do so, but I think it’s just a trick Pamuk uses in order to keep his reader curious, only to leave him with a dilemma at the end. Hmm.. So in order to feed my recent interest in Turkish culture, I think my next Pamuk will be something quite different. Something that focuses on modern Turkey / the conflict between traditional and modern, old VS new etc. And I need some films, as well; I feel Fatih Akin’s are not enough.","May 14, 2010"

You tricked me, Mr.Pamuk! And I liked it!. The best part about this book was the exploration of identity. What does it mean, when I say who I am? What makes me me and not someone else? Not something I want to think about all the time, but excellent thoughts to spin around in the early hours of the morning.. Slightly beside the point, but I must vent: My Finnish edition of this book has the whole plot explained on the back cover. Probably the most annoying thing a publisher can do! Once I got to the ending, nothing surprising had happened and I felt a bit cheated. It took me a while to get over it and realize that I enjoyed the book despite this deception.. The people who reveal major plot points in the back cover should be punished. My suggestion: gather them all in a secluded place and give them a whole bunch of interesting books to read.

78854108,Gil,"4 stars. What a mind-bending, intellectually satisfying read!. The White Castle. is set in a semi-historical, semi-mythical 17th-century Istanbul, and opens with the unnamed narrator telling us how he came to live there. When he was a young man, the narrator’s ship is captured by a Turkish fleet. During his captivity in prison, he meets a man who looks exactly like him - his doppelgänger - and this man, known only as Hoja or ‘master’, would later purchase him as his slave. Hoja contemptuously demands the unnamed narrator to teach him everything he knows. Of course, the narrator has no choice but to do so, but he also keeps his opinions to himself, never telling Hoja what he really thinks of his progress in learning and his idea. One day, however, when a plague sweeps through the city (ironic, given the current pandemic), their relationship shifts: With nothing else to do during the period of self-isolation, the narrator and Hoja confront each other in tense, hate-filled, violent, conversations that nevertheless allow them to get to know the other and themselves better than they had before.. I’ve never quite read a dynamic like the narrator’s and Hoja’s, and I was particularly fascinated by the intricate mind games they played with each other. While their relationship is marked by an unequal power dynamic - that of master and slave - these roles aren’t the sole determinant of the power they can wield against each other. For one, despite being a slave, the narrator is more educated than Hoja and comes from a country that Hoja respects (although Hoja never despises the respect he has for the West). On the other hand, Hoja saved the narrator’s life, and as the master he reserves every right a master has over his slave. The narrator thinks Hoja as beneath him; Hoja knows this and hates him for it, even as he seeks the narrator’s approval on his ideas. On the other hand, the narrator is largely contemptuous of Hoja’s personality - he’s arrogant, vengeful, and prone to fits of rage - but there are moments when he grudgingly admires Hoja’s mind, acknowledging that Hoja might have surpassed his own knowledge. Throughout most of the story, they dance around each other like this, concealing any positive impressions and taking a perverse pleasure in hurting each other.. Still, they manage to finally open up, the narrator more so than Hoja because of the unequal power dynamic. This happens as a result of a game: They each write out their life stories in response to the question, “Why am I what I am?” With this, the book raises some interesting questions about identity and self-reflection. Given that they’re so physically alike, can they be psychologically alike, as well? Can they, in fact, be the same person? How difficult could it be to take on another person’s identity? How much of oneself is unique, and how much is a reflection of other people?. Aside from being a commentary on the individual psyche, however,. The White Castle. is also an allegory for the fraught, love-hate relationship between Turkey and the West. I can’t expound beyond this because I know very little about Turkey, but in my opinion this point wasn’t forcibly made; it arose naturally from the relationship between the narrator and Hoja.. Overall, this was an excellent read. I’d recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, especially those with a semi-mythical atmosphere, and anyone who loves in-depth psychological portraits of unlikeable characters. 4 out of 5 stars.. Come to my blog!","Mar 26, 2020"
2596042,Lisa (Harmonybites),"Orhan Pamuk has won the Nobel Prize for literature and is supposed to be the premier man of letters in contemporary Turkey. However, I noted that more than one person on my friends' list on Goodreads was less than enthused with his books. Thus, instead of reading his more famous. My Name is Red. or. Snow. , I deliberately chose the slimmest volume on the shelf for my introduction--. The White Castle. --a mere 161 pages--yet this couldn't hold me even that far.. Set in seventeenth century Turkey, it's the first person account of a Venetian captured and enslaved by the Turks. He comes to be owned by a master who is his physical double, who demands he teach him all he knows. Basically, what lost me was the style. And not because it was difficult or abstruse. Despite quotes comparing Pamuk to such writers as DeLillo, Borges, Nabokov and Proust, the prose in this novel is very simple--even simplistic. I never felt pulled in by the story or characters. The picture painted by the prose felt sketchy. There's very little dialogue, none of which is off-set. It's not so much a back and forth but rather a lot is reported or summarized. A lot of the events were summarized too rather than shown. Nothing made me feel a sense of time or place or characters in ways vivid enough to feel worth my time--so I stopped. And I think that's enough of Pamuk for me.","Aug 17, 2012"

Had it not been such a short book, I probably wouldn’t have managed to read to the end. It’s an interesting story (if you suspend your disbelief regarding doppelgangers) and it has a good ending, but it dragged at parts and the narration was all over the place. The characters’ relationship should have been complex and compelling but instead felt bipolar and lazy. The preface was probably my favorite part yet it really served no purpose. Going in, I was aware this book is from very early in Pamuk’s career, but it was still disappointing considering it’s by a Nobel Prize winner.","Jul 18, 2015"

3926982,Shovelmonkey1,"The White Castle, or Beyaz Kale as it was first printed in Turkish is a book which looks long and hard at the idea of personal identity. The narrator asks ""Of what importance is it who a man is? The important thing is what we have done and will do."" This Kafka-esque statement eloquently sums up the essence of the two main characters, the Hoja (teacher) and his Italian slave. Throughout their time together slave and master are caught in a tussle over their identities.. Both recognise the similarities in appearance, desire and intellect but cannot reconcile themselves to the character flaws which they observe in each other. They are like physical windows into the souls of each other with each man looking deeper and deeper for answers but only growing more despairing when they find things that they do not like. The fact that they are master and slave means that they can never bridge this gap to become friends and find a way of truly understanding and appreciating each other because society rules dictate against this. And as the slave is tied to the master, so the Hoja is tied to his need to please the Ottoman Sultan and win his favour.. A story of grandiose schemes, incessant desires of mind and flesh and the battle to be accepted, all set against the resplendent backdrop of Ottoman Istanbul, the gentle wash of the Bosphorus on the shore line and the beating of the Janissary drums.","Jun 29, 2011"

1466146,Wayne,"This charming novella in style and size and subject matter became a dreary haul too soon.. The relationship between the poor Italian slave and his neurotic look-alike Turkish master just became tedious and repetitive. Although I eventually tried to gallop towards the end it seemed to grow ever distant.. HOWEVER (wonderful word that!!),the last chapters were moving.. And the poor Turk's determination to prove that one's enemies are thoroughly evil...so much like the recent Coalition of the Willing and the belief in the Devil espoused by many American leaders and combatants...results only in his humanity becoming debased as he fails to extract confessions that match his projections of evil.. The final unravelling of the relationship of slave and master too is gently sad and the reconciliation of two identities is full but also empty.. I guess I finally really liked it!!!!. Actually I think what I REALLY liked was having finished what was an incredibly tortuous puzzle that the writer could not have untangled himself and in fact never intended it to be...because it is a fake in the first place...a symbol only.. The ten repetitive chapters are UNforgivable in retrospect.. Often incomprehensible books which are often tedious into the bargain are taken for being PROFOUND...and it becomes like the Emperor's New Clothes which don't exist until some naive Innocent,not in the least Learned, points out the Obvious - that the Important Bloke is...NAKED ! Pseudo Cognoscenti are appalled at being exposed in another way.. Strangely Royal Families are even more naked today...as Michel de Montaigne said 400 plus years ago: Even on the highest throne in the world we are still sat on our backsides."". Anyway, I do smell a rat.. Perhaps this novella would have been better reduced to the size of a short story to have been more effective...or just a much shorter novella. It's present length is extreme.. One of ""My Favourite Authors"",the perceptive Marcel Proust,is one who needs some editing.He drives home a point, but finally excessively, because he cannot bear to sacrifice what is a profusion of wonderful examples created by a brilliant creative mind.. As with Shakespeare,who also suffers from some wonky plots,which is not to attack the superb poetry...editing and rewriting are terms rarely directed by some publishers to their Great Writers a recent Literary Review pointed out.

26546264,Aziza,"The plot of The White Castle seems simple enough: During the seventeenth century, a Venetian is kidnapped by Turkish raiders and sold into slavery to a Turkish scholar who oddly enough looks a lot like him. The two men start studying biology, astronomy, and engineering together, and even try to construct a powerful weapon for the Sultan. Tellingly, the latter seems more interested in legends and soothe-saying than in modern inventions and advances. The novel ends questioning the protagonist as well as the reader regarding the identity of the two main characters; were they indeed two separate people, or was it a single person with two different aspects of one personality?. Whether the ending is seen as a cheap trick, a Tarantino-like twist, or witty meta-language, does not change my opinion of this novel; while clever, the novel is too artificial and more concerned with themes and ideas than people and feelings. For one, Pamuk tells readers about the conflicts between the protagonists and the differences between the cultures instead of showing us. Unlike for example the hilarious, recognizable culture clashes in Marjan Kamalia’s Together Tea, the scenes about colliding cultures in The White Castle are bone dry. Likewise, the issue of (cultural) identity is smartly presented, but is not as touching as in the before-mentioned novel.. Granted the scenes about cultural identity are not meant to be sentimental; instead, they are a study in what it is like to be a modern Turk, legacy of Kemal Ataturk, who was the only leader in the history of Muslim nations who succeeded in separating state and religion. Pamuk seems to say that modern Turks have a dual personality, consisting of a Western side (represented by the Italian slave and the desire of his Turkish slave-owner to learn about modern advances) and an Eastern side (represented by the Turkishness of the actual Turk as well as the Sultan’s penchant for tradition and superstition). While certainly deftly written to set readers on the wrong foot thereby forcing them to question the concept of identity, I prefer a more human (and humane) approach to the duality of the Turkish nation as portrayed in Elif Shafak’s The Bastard of Istanbul.","Feb 01, 2014"
257105,Ayu Palar,"It's always interesting to know how authors improve from their first novel to their last one. I first encountered Pamuk's world of words through. My Name is Red. , and after several novels, I finally got in touch with his debut novel,. The White Castle. . I have to say that his father was completely right when he said his son would get a Nobel prize someday. Pamuk got the natural talent to be one of the most memorable writers in the world.. In. The White Castle. , there are seeds that would bloom in. My Name is Red. : his mastery in creating the eerie, unique and captivating atmosphere through words. For me, Pamuk is at his best when he writes about the Ottoman Empire, not the modern Turkey. He managed to blend words to build a world that is sadly trapped between two cultural powers. But what's great about. The White Castle. is not only the setting, but the identity theme. A theme that confuses me until the last page. Who is who? Which one is which?. The White Castle. starts with the narration of a young Venetian man captured by pirates then sold to a slave market in Ottoman. Thanks to his Western knowledge that amazes many people, he's treated nicely by the sultan. His life is turning upside down when he meets Hoja, someone who looks exactly the same with him. Their lives are tangled in a love-hate relationship. Sometimes they can spend hours in the room working for a project and enjoy their intimate times, but sometimes they can be engaged in a heavily serious argument they can kill each other. This is the interesting aspect from. The White Castle. : the relationship between two guys who look like each other. It's like. The Prince and The Pauper. but darker and more complex. How about the ending? Without meaning to reveal it all, I must say it's a happy one. But for who? I cannot find the answer for that because I don't know either. And that's the magic of.

Looking into a mirror to see who you are and looking into a book to see who somebody else is--two very similar actions but with results that differ.

At the end, I understood that I had thought about many themes. It made me imagine fantastic, dream trips across frozen steppes, twisted me around in my mind till I felt like a sick dwarf, and left me wondering who could have written such a strange, powerful novel. And why ? I admired this writer, who I had not read before, because of this power. The story as such is not that found in a usual ""novel"". It is a Kafkaesque parable, it reminds people of Borges (even on the book jacket), but is not so much like him, calmer and deeper. Pamuk asks who anybody really is and how do you know ? At another level his parable is of relations between the Ottoman Empire and the West, between those who came up with victorious technology and those who attempted to learn it. (p.106) ""..we had in hand not a grand plan that would save us from ruin, but only the dream of such a plan."" If you want to call this theme ""historical fiction"" then OK, this is an historical novel, but I would not call it that. What kind of background is needed for scientific discovery ? This question might be a sub-theme, but not the major point. The book is in no way about Islam, unless you want to point a finger at that religion for not inspiring science. Accusations of that sort are a stupid activity if there ever was one. Can one person be another ? Can you change your life for one you'd rather have?

2201886,Mike,"After reading “My Name is Red”, I knew that I would be reading more by Mr. Pamuk. So, in preparation for a multi-week trip overseas, I scoped out the volumes in the local library branch. In a way, “The White Castle” was pre-selected both for size (light, good form factor for reading in planes, trains, and hotels) and for holding my interest (I read the blurbs on the books that were available). Usually, I won’t do such pre-screening other than to look at the cover. (You’d be surprised how many decent books you can find by the cover title or art.). As you can tell from my ranking, I don’t think I made a bad choice. I found the book to be original, highly engaging and well-written. Whether this is a reasonable parallel or not, I was reminded of the writings of Umberto Eco both during and after reading “The White Castle”. I didn’t think that way when reading or reviewing “My Name is Red”, but the echoes are there even though that novel is so strikingly different.. Once again, the background of historical fact and fiction was a very large part of keeping an exhausted reader attentive. But the interplay of the two central characters and their “overt” influences on each other also kept me reading. The more subtle thread of identity which is explored but also deliberately obscured is appreciated best after more than 3-1/2 hours of sleep a night. So, several days later my mind has mulled over the layering of this part of the tale and its supposed outcome. Is “A” now “B”? Or did “A” remain “A” but take on the thoughts and internal identity of “B”? Read it and decide for yourself.. While it is not the tour-de-force of “My Name is Red”, this is a very satisfying and very good book. It certainly takes an author of the caliber of Mr. Pamuk to conceive and create such an original, but once done an imitator might produce something that’s 80% of the tale. While me-too books might be okay for an average read, they won’t get high marks from me. So far I think that I will stick with historical fiction from this author. I like getting intimate details of a culture that I knew only superficially. Free mind stretching and great writing; who could ask for anything more?","Jul 14, 2011"
1651288,Camille Tesch,"I expected more from a book that won the pulitzer prize. As I read it, I kept thinking of the prince and the pauper. While it has some elements of that, it's more about identity and what makes us who we are and different or the same as other people. I thought the writing was well done, but I didn't like the characters. There is too much going on about how the main characters think they're better than the common masses. There's talk about science and becoming scholars, but the characters are all talk and no action. I often found the characters to be rather pathetic. I did like the flavor of the setting in the Ottoman Empire. In some ways the magical realism reminded me of Paulo Coehlo, who I enjoy much more.","Jun 15, 2010"

I read a bunch of Pamuk when I was bumming around Turkey years ago and I didn’t really like it but I thought I’d read some more to figure if it was my fault or his fault but I’m still not sure. It’s the kind of book which feints towards having a real narrative but page to page it’s pretty interminable, like there’s three sentences on invading Hungary and five pages about a dream one of the characters have (Umberto Eco does the same thing).

6672631,James K,"This is one of my favourite shorter novels. A deftly constructed, elaborate story and frame-narrative about a 17th century Italian intellectual who is captured by Ottomans and turned into a slave. The novel follows his resulting life in Istanbul and the strange relationship he has with his master, Hoja, who is his exact doppelgänger. Pamuk's prose is characteristically dreamy yet absorbing, and the surreal power dynamic between the Italian and Hoja, in all its religious, queer and East-West implications proves a delight to untangle. This is a smart psychological novel about identity, power and faith.","Apr 11, 2020"
2338568,B. Asma,"The problem with. The White Castle. , imho, is the narrative-told format, dialogue-less story, an excellent tale, but I think of novels as replete with dialogue. One reason for the lack of dialogue could be to accentuate the shared identity between the two main characters, the Venetian narrator and the Hoja. Aside from the long narration, the pros outweigh the cons. Pamuk knows how to create historical atmosphere, this setting in seventeenth-century Istanbul. Two science enthusiast-practitioners (an Ottoman Turk and a captured Venetian) write books/tell stories, devise technological things, explain nature, and act as royal astrologers, all in the service of Sultan Mehmet IV at a time when advanced scientific views such as the heliocentric theory of the universe are making inroads, being carried by way of travelers and translations. Another pro for this novel is the unusual relationship between the two main characters. Hoja is supposed to be the master, but it's the captive/made-slave Venetian who transfers the scientific learning to Hoja. Besides this twist is another one wherein the two, look-alike men over the years become so interchangeable that no one can differentiate between them. The 'twins' know each other's background so well that they can convincingly playact the other person. Aside from the pros and cons, one might well wonder about this novel's title. It is mentioned in the penultimate chapter as the Sultan's troops with Hoja's years-in-the-making, cumbrous cannon in tow attempt to storm a white castle, whose designated name means 'double' in Italian. During this trek to lay siege, everyone's worst traits appear as a sour note toward fulfilling their mission. The story then switches to the appearance of the pure white castle on a hilltop and hints at what it takes to possibly reach it.","Mar 24, 2012"
940282,Psychophant,"This is a short novel, a novella, actually. Yet it took me a long time to finish it. Part of it is the Unreliable Narrator. I do not dislike them, and some of my favorite books make use of them, but they always slow things while I overanalyze the text. Then, the main subject, identity, and what makes us unique compared to what makes us similar, is quite close to my own core fears, so I had to read it in small doses. Finally, Pamuk (or maybe it is the translator's fault) is still finding his own narrative voice, so it gets heavy going at times.. The plot is secondary, the glimpse of the Seventeenth century Ottoman Empire is attiring, the questions are heavy, too heavy for the limited narrative scaffolding keeping it up. They swallow the middle part of the book, making it unwieldy and making the narrative serve the questions, rather than the other way round. The ending however, once the author's thesis is finally presented and dispensed with, is excellent.. The characters make the story, and they are presented very well ina very indirect way, so indirectly that you wonder about them when you realize you may know more than the narrator about them.. A frustrating book, short but heavy going, full of great writing interspersed with dull philosophizing. It is better if you have read other Pamuk books before, such as. My Name is Red. , that deals with similar themes.","Apr 28, 2008"
1130482,Igor,"The account of a Venetian slave in service of a Turkish inventor and erudite in XVII century Istanbul sounds like the perfect setup for a colourful and captivating adventure. But it quickly becomes clear that the main theme of the story is the question of what makes us us and not someone else. That question itself is a byproduct of a never ending game for intellectual dominance the two men are playing over the years while leading mostly uneventful lives - only the answer is never fully pursued neither by the slave, who is fascinated by his master's uncanny physical resemblance to him nor by the master who is obsessed with proving his intellectual and moral superiority over his slave - thus the book never realizes its potential as a psychological novel, while the slow pace kills it as a historical drama. The dichotomy between eastern and western culture is almost entirely dismissed and plays diminutive role. All of this made me feel disinterested and unsympathetic towards the protagonists. In fact I was tempted to listen to narrator's plea and leave the book unfinished, but I endured.. Was the book a disappointment to me, then? Yes, to a degree. ""The White Castle"" is my first Pamuk novel and my expectations were high. Maybe if they weren't, I would enjoy it more, as it was evident to me that the author knows his craft and is an able storyteller. But I don't feel burned and can see myself giving his writing another shot in a few months.","Oct 15, 2012"
4540373,Shishir Chaudhary,"There are books, like a good wine, that you need to savour. You have to sip, pause, reflect and sip to get the true taste and when you finish one, you feel contented. The White Castle is one such book. An extremely gripping story of two men, identical to each other in person and pursuit, one slave and another his master, who together meander through the alleys of science and art, it will make you think and question ""why you are who you are"". There are multiple interesting stories of the scientific quests - developing a clock, inventing the ultimate weapon of war, exploring the dark realms of human mind - but the one that I found most interesting was the one that involved a plague, more because of the scientific acumen the characters showed and their helplessness when questioned by an unscientific Sultan and his people.. The only drawback, and a major one at that, was the narrative of the book - the structure, to be precise. To be true, it turned out to be extremely monotonous. For me, sentences should be musical, they should speak by their mere constructs, which this book lacked.. It is recommended for readers who would want to take a glimpse of Pamuk's brilliance, this being his first book. Read it for the sheer brilliance of different episodes, self-satisfaction of having read a pretty difficult book and the thrilling climax!","Oct 31, 2016"
4850367,Sean,"""The White Castle"" by Orhan Pamuk is a first novel that shows cleverness and sparks of the Nobel Prize winning author's future promise but suffers from an amateur style, a predictable plot, and dull pacing. Like many 'postcolonial' novels, ""The White Castle"" deals with many of the familiar tropes concerning the divides between East and West and the fear/desire of becoming the Other. However, other books do those themes much better and with more artistry and nuance. This is the fourth book by Pamuk I have read (""Istanbul: Memories of a City,"" ""Snow,"" ""My Name Is Read"") and feel that this was the weakest out of the four-interesting but unenjoyable, short but a chore to get through. If you like Pamuk's other works, ""The White Castle"" is worth a look but otherwise, go for his later works.","Sep 17, 2011"

2436371,Dennis Littrell,"A case of intellectual incest?. Nobel Prize Literature Laureate (2006), Orhan Pamuk, in his first work translated into English from the Turkish, gives us in The White Castle an obsessive tale of a bizarre relationship. He begins with an old framing device, that of finding a manuscript which he then publishes. (Actually, Pamuk is even further removed since he has a fictional character, one Faruk Darvinoglu, find the manuscript and dedicate the book to his deceased sister.) Nathaniel Hawthorne used a similar conceit in The Scarlet Letter (1850). This manuscript is a first-person narrative by an unnamed Italian author who was captured by the Turks and taken into slavery in 17th century. He eventually becomes the personal servant of a Turkish man of similar age--and most importantly--of similar appearance. In fact the two could pass as twins.. This similarity of appearance begins to haunt the Italian, partly because the similarity is inexplicable and partly because the two become so intertwined intellectually and emotionally. Their relationship deepens as Hoja, the Turk who is obsessed with learning, especially learning what he considers science, begins to pick apart the narrator's brain. As time passes they exchange ideas and memories, beliefs and every aspect of their knowledge with the sense that it is the Italian slave who is tutoring the Turkish intellectual. Eventually Hoja with the help of the narrator's learning becomes an advisor of sorts to the young sultan. He interprets his dreams, predicts the end of a plague, constructs mechanical devices and toys for the sultan's amusement, tells stories for entertainment and generally becomes one of the favored members at court. He gains in power and influence and is rewarded with grants of land by the sultan so that he has a secure income.. Meanwhile the narrator, whom Hoja often abuses physically and mentally, has learned Turkish and has made himself indispensable to Hoja. The sultan senses that much of Hoja's impressive learning comes from the Italian slave, and eventually the narrator also becomes a favorite at the sultan's palace. It could be said that what we are witnessing in this story in a symbolic sense is the encroaching influence of science and technology on the Islamic state.. It is psychologically understandable and indeed perhaps inevitable that the narrator would form in his mind ambivalent feelings of love and hate for Hoja, whom he so resembles and with whom he is in nearly constant contact. As the years pass and their differences meld, and as each learns the heart and soul of the other, they become more and more alike until.... Is Hoja the doppelganger or is it the other way around? Is it possible that Hoja will leave Turkey and ""return"" to Italy after having so thoroughly gleaned the narrator's brain that he can pass as the narrator, even to his Italian family? After all these years, the suggestion that Pamuk makes--and this is really the brilliance of the novel--is that yes it could happen. And could the narrator stay on in Turkey, marry and have children while assuming the identity of Hoja without anyone really being able to tell the difference? Could time and acquaintance overcome the accident of one's birth, overcome even the accent with which one speaks so that one is the other and vice-versa? In a larger sense could such an intense, close relationship over several decades so confuse the minds of these two that they no longer know where the one begins and the other leaves off?. Pamuk's narrative is deliberate and slow-paced, as least by contemporary standards, intensely felt, and carefully wrought. You may find yourself putting it aside at first, so slowly does the story develop. It covers the span of several decades until the narrator is in his seventies. It is picturesque in the style of stories from centuries past which told of exotic places and strange adventures. There is a vivid sense of a world in transition from the feudal to the modern, of a world hungry for the renaissance, hungry for the knowledge of the West, and yet content within an Islamic society ruled by sultans and imams.. This is the first novel of Pamuk's I have read, and one of his earliest. It is obvious from this relatively modest work that he is a writer of vision and understanding. I am looking forward to reading his more recent work.. --Dennis Littrell, author of the mystery novel, “Teddy and Teri”","Apr 22, 2010"
352711,Leftbanker,"So this is basically a pastiche of Borges, which is a pretty good place to start for a novel. For such an incredibly short novel, this one is an enormously ambitious work, and for that I have to give it the highest rating. With this said, he really lost me for much of the book, blame it on the translation.. I just really wanted to read something that would work towards my personal edification. I’ve read a ton on crime fiction this year as I’ve been writing in this genre, I felt I needed to take some forays into what most people (in this case the Nobel Prize folks) would consider literature. The truth is that Richard Price’s. Lush Life. is an infinitely more intriguing novel than most of the crap I read this past year that won literary awards.. The truth is that I’m not. muy. crazy about Borges. I would wager that there are few young people who want to be writers because of Borges. Pamuk is one of those few and for me it seems like a big waste of a great talent. Let me explain.. I can’t believe that there aren’t bigger issues to address in the modern world of Turkey than tales of fantasy and imagination. Even shrouded in allegory he’s not pointing his finger at Turkish society. I’m just speaking for my own personal tastes but where are the novels about the big issues we face today?. Pamuk is more Proust than Zola, and that is a big minus as far as I rate writers. I’ve read Borges, in Spanish (not to brag) and I can’t rate him among my favorites because he never addressed a single social problem of his day.. He really lost me through most of the book. I just thought that this would be an incredibly easy story to make vivid and interesting to readers, yet I was bored at times and lost the thread of what he was trying to convey.","Dec 30, 2018"

21413390,Aatreyee Dhar,"""Consumed by the mystifying body politic of identity crisis with an edgy tail end: The White Castle by Orphan Pamuk "". Orphan Pamuk’s facile novella prefaces with an oracular character from his previous book who comes across a manuscript that he manages to scour through among musty-old bureaucratic red tapes and Government papers. The story breaks ice with an Italian slave being captured and forced to surrender under the proponents of the Ottoman empire with the narrative grinding its way into the dark alleys of the dynamics of slave-master trade that was rampant eons ago and still continues to haunt the premises of the yarns that are spun upon the scathing and eye-catching developments and misfortunes.. When the Slave is pressured into forsaking his religion by the Pasha,he refuses to give in owing to which he is sold as a slave to his Doppleganger,Hoja. The Slave still gets to call the shots as he tricks and cons his way into corroborating his achievements in medicine,astronomy ,anatomy etc that effects upon the Pasha on moments of dire need ,manifesting as reliable results often suggestive of the cure aided through the relentless insights into the endless pursuit of knowledge through all manners of books .But after being coerced into servitude to his Master and the Sultan,his discernment,skills and perceptivity were reduced to mere indulgences in aiding the Hoja to become venerated and famous in the eyes of the Sultan and his associates . But Hoja knew his limitations too well to push his lookalike into the murky and dangerous waters when he failed to live up to his farfetched and overdone promises ,hence pinning the blame and fleeing the scene by sheer grasp of Identity theft .. Even through the flywheels of this persistent struggle for power, the two identities get to know each other dwelling on the metaphysical probing of “Why I am What I am” unanimously agreeing to swap each other’s identity when the Sultan ordered to execute the Hoja as a result of his hobbyhorse insect-like weapon stuck in the swamp , precipitating the war to come to a barefaced and depraved defeat in Edirne,near the White Castle against the enemies .. Entering into the truth vs reality conundrum at the end of this self exploration odyssey ,it may seem either the narrator is reliving or revisiting the figments of his imagination up to the point that he actually started believing them or there are slight chances that the uncanny nuances of this relationship actually happened ,which is hard to reckon citing the unforgiving yet overwhelming lines as,. “I could tell from the clever questions he asked, from his shrewdness, that ever since he’d received the books we presented to him the sultan had been speculating how much of Hoja was me, and how much of me was Hoja. . . . He disentangled us with his observations about our speech and behaviour. These observations, which I found sometimes childish and sometimes clever, started to worry me: I began to believe that my personality had split itself off from me and united with Hoja’s, and vice versa. . . . The sovereign would stop suddenly and, turning to one of us, say, “No, this is his thought, not yours. . . . Now you are glancing around just as he does. Be yourself!” When I laughed in surprise he’d continue, “That’s better, bravo. Have you two never looked at yourselves in the mirror together?” He’d ask which of us could stand to be himself when we did look in the mirror.”","May 26, 2017"
10989168,Doug,"The White Castle is a tough book to review. As I read it, I kept thinking 'this is just OK', but having just finished it, I find myself thinking deeply about it, more so than I have done with many other books.. The writing was enjoyable and it was worthwhile to finally read Pamuk, someone who has been on my radar since a visit to Turkey in the late 2000s. I'm not really sure whether I can add much to the plot synopses provided by others on here. This novel is definitely heavy on philosophy, examining the interactions between a master and slave (albeit an idealized one, if that is possible). It pulled me down a few interesting online rabbit holes, including Hegel's master–slave dialectic after a visit to Wikipedia (why am I embarrassed by this?). I like that one reviewer on Goodreads took away a message that life should be enjoyed not just endured, though that idea troubled me later, as the narrator was a slave who was, at least initially, held against his own will. I could go on, but to summarize, the book didn't stand out as a favorite, but was short enough to finish easily. The ending was abrupt, as others have mentioned, but this didn't bother me too much. Still, I think I enjoyed where The White Castle took me as a whole more than the ride along the way.","Jul 22, 2019"
1758411,Lisa,"The White Castle is a short novella of only 145 pages, but it took me forever to read. It’s a title from the Faber Firsts collection, celebrating the first novels of such authors as Peter Carey (Bliss), Sylvia Plath (The Bell Jar) and William Golding (Lord of the Flies), and Faber has included it in this collection because it was the first of Pamuk’s novels to be available in English, in 1985. His first novel was actually Mr. Cevdet and His Sons published in 1982.. I expected to like The White Castle because I’ve read and really liked three of Orhan Pamuk’s novels: Snow, The Museum of Innocence, and Silent House. But The White Castle, despite its pedigree as winner of the 1990 Independent Foreign Fiction Prize, failed to engage me. I dawdled through it, punctuated by extended frolics with Samurai Sudoku (always a bad sign).. It’s the story of an unnamed Italian scholar who is captured by pirates and sold at a slave auction in Istanbul. He is acquired by Hoja, a Turkish savant with ambitions to be a Big Deal at court, but the Italian is not treated like a piece of property. He is not treated as a slave using the tropes with which we are familiar (humiliation, degradation, exploitation and/or brutality); for him, enslavement means the loss of his freedom and an almost visceral longing for home.. Indeed, his life is almost congenial. Hoja admires European advances in science and engineering, and it is his desire that the Italian should teach him everything he knows. So their relative positions are inverted, the Italian with his superior knowledge becoming the teacher and the Turk becoming the able pupil, intent on being able to impress the Sultan and gain favour at court. But the Italian is a man of straw: even though he is very intelligent, he has actually faked being a doctor in order to get preferential treatment in the slave market. The novella is, of course, an allegory for Turkey’s position in the modern world apropos Europe, and even as his obsession with improving on Western military technology fails risibly, Pamuk’s Hoja rails against ignorance and the fools who sabotage his attempts to modernise the court’s modus operandi away from soothsaying and superstition. But it is only fair to say that if I hadn’t read Pamuk’s other novels with their themes of Turkish identity and its struggles with modernism, I think I might well have missed the point..

2265896,Francesca Forrest,"I read a description of the scenario of this (Venetian man captured in the Mediterranean and becomes the slave of a Turkish man who is his physical double; their lives mysteriously blend) and thought it sounded fascinating, so gave it a try. I knew from the description I had read that there'd be no dialogue, but I found this made more of a problem for me than I was expecting, for this reason: everything I-the-reader experience is filtered through the consciousness of the narrator, and I find the narrator's consciousness incomprehensible, and the situation, too, a little incomprehensible.. I found myself looking for clues in the outer world of the story--the politics and intrigue of court, the growing up of the young sultan, the reactions of others to the things the two men (the doubles) are studying--to try to get some bearings, but meanwhile there was the relentlessness of the two men's impossibly close, impossibly difficult relationship.. I couldn't get any sense of development in their relationship or in either of their attitudes. Hoja (the Turkish man) veers this way and that in his attitudes toward his own research, his own abilities, others' approval, and the narrator. I didn't get a sense of progress. One minute it's this, then it's that, then it's back to this again. And the same with the narrator. And the narrator writes about, for example, tedious repetition of the days and months... and I was feeling that reading the book. Where was it all going? Nowhere that I understood, and not fast enough.. I felt low, giving it up. I felt like this was clearly a case of my not reading it with the right mental equipment, not looking at it through the right lens. Someone compared Orhan Pamuk's writing to Italo Calvino's and I can see this! I have some of the same sort of reaction to Calvino's stuff, but enough stuff falls on the side of accessibility for me that I can enjoy it. Here I felt just lost.. More than that, though, I just didn't like the process of getting to wherever the story was going. There's going to be some conflation, or substitution, of the one man for the other, I gather but--gah, I just wanted out of the brain of the first guy, and away from the whole situation. So I quit reading.","Feb 18, 2012"

But I kind of loved it. It was my first touch with Turkish culture which years later managed to become part of my daily existence. That being said, I found nothing genuinely Turkish in ""The White Castle"". I could have written that with very shallow knowledge about Ottoman Turkey. More so, I read the book with an extremely poor translation (that's the only copy I have) and I could just see through the foolish rookie mistakes that the self taught translator has made. I study Turkish language, among other things, at university and we have actually discussed how exactly bad the translator is.. And so those were my two big mistakes: I was expecting something and expectation never leads to anything good when it comes to literature and I read a bad translation.. So naturally, I can safely assume I had a fault in not liking the book. But Pamuk is not faultless either. As I pointed out, the book was lacking when it came to showing the true nature if the Turks, even told from the perspective of a foreigner. Also, it was childishly simplistic, much too summarized opposed to actually showing the events as they unfold. The secondary characters were completely one-sided and flat. The persona of the Hoja was only shown through the prism of the narrator which makes the impact of the ending a lot less strong because the reader has nothing to put in comparison.. But I will not lie, I did like the ending, in spite of everything, it was the book's one true redeeming quality. I expected something like that but I was moved by the two-sided-ness, the parallel of the process.","Jul 16, 2014"
1222586,Timothy,"I really liked The White Castle. However, I am at a loss on how to write a review. The novel can be described as deceptively simple. The book is short. It is written in first person narrative. At times, the narrator hints that the book is a diary of sorts. Yet, unlike a typical diary, the narrator seeks less to describe his thoughts and feelings, then to lay out his life events in linear sequence. It is as if the narrator wants to document the events in his life for posterity; as if he deems them important. This goes hand in hand with a sense the reader gets throughout the novel: there is depth that is belied by length and narrative style. And, it is not a “forced” depth. Pamuk does not put on airs under the mantle of art. He tries to be subtle and simple, yet profound.. Herein lies the problem. The profundity is so abstract that I am unsure what to make of it. I could certainly develop theories. I could draw upon aspects of the novel, and guess what Pamuk was trying to achieve. But, I fear that such guesses would simply be reflections of my own biases; manifestations of things I have read, my education, experiences, etc. Maybe this is good. Maybe the best art is open to multiple interpretations.. In any case, there are themes in The White Castle. The novel seems to be on epistemology – how we know what we think we know. Pamuk contrasts Eastern and Western theories of knowledge. Interestingly, he does this in the context of a master-slave relationship between the main characters. Yet, the power dynamic in their relationship shifts throughout the novel, perhaps implying, by extension, an interchangeability of Eastern and Western worldviews?","Nov 05, 2008"
35230965,Aligroof,"Orhan Pamuk -recipient of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature- is my favourite writer of all time. this work is one of his early works, where he was struggling to find -as he later admited in an interview- his voice. Before the white castle he wrote a couple of works in a 'classic' style (Jevdet bek and his sons and the Silent House). In the White Castle he was trying to be a post-modern writer, but things didn't work well with him in my opinion. He found his voice in the Black Book. For me Pamuk was born with the publication of the Black Book, then he wrote all his graet works: the New Life, My Mame is Red, Snow, Other Colours, the Museume of Innocence. Although the New Life was written in this era, it was an exception, it didn't share the greatness of the works written in that era imo. I read all of Pamuk's works long ago, yesterday I was thinking about his works, and decided to change its rating from 3 to two stars. I usually revisit old books to change there ratings!. As I said, for me Pamuk was born with the Black book. I took that phrase from him, as he explained that Dostievisky found his voice in Letters From the Underground. When I first read Letters From Underground I rated it as 1 star. It was very bizzare and disturbing for me. the I revisited it to give it 3 stars, again after few months, then I gave it 4, then I changed it after a few months and gave it 5 stars at the end. It toke me too long to digest it.","Sep 22, 2014"
4241257,MargeryK,"Unfortunately my reading of this book was interrupted by 'Our Tragic Universe' which had been requested from the library. I zapped through the first forty or so pages of 'White Castle', but when I returned to it after a hiatus, I found it much more of a slog.. The premise is that a Venetian scholar is taken as a slave by Turks and ends up being the companion of Hoja, his master, who entreats our scholar to teach him all he knows. The story is set in seventeenth century Constantinople. The scholar and master have an uncanny likeness to one another, and they become so entwined in their various exploits over a twenty-five year span, that their identities appear to merge.. I didn't particularly enjoy this book. It is the second Pamuk I've read, the other being 'Snow', which I similarly didn't really enjoy at the time. However, since reading it back in the winter, I have recalled 'Snow' fondly and so this was the main reason for giving this Nobel Laureate another go. The scrapes and japes that the scholar and Hoja get into reminded me of a tame version of Voltaire's 'Candide'. Without the laughs","May 01, 2011"
48206,kasia,"I think one would need to achieve the perfect balance of pace in reading this book to get the full benefit; fast enough that you don't lose interest, but slow enough that you can actually absorb it. I erred on the side of speed, so I feel like I didn't properly appreciate the novel. At the same time, it's a slow build-up, and it's really only in the last 30 pages or so that it starts to pay off. That final portion did make me appreciate the book, which I'd been finding a bit tedious up to that point, but it is nonetheless not the most approachable of books. It's one of those somewhat mind-bending works where you find yourself thinking that you didn't quite get it, but also wondering if there actually was something to get.. Blog review. Edit: So I just re-read this, and I have to say, the second time around, it really blows you away. It helped that I had to spend 3 hours analyzing it with my students =-) so I actually had to think about it carefully, and man, when you do, there's definitely a pay-off. It's a book you need to read at least twice to appreciate.","May 21, 2011"
5343048,Michelle,"I love the idea of this book: a glimpse of 17th-century Istanbul, a meeting of Italian and Turkish cultures, a murky confusion of identities, a project to build a revolutionary new weapon. Yet despite these elements of philosophy and adventure, when I finished the book I was left with no desire to contemplate its message and no hangover of excitement.. I recall no images from the novel, no sense of the narrator's everyday life, no sights or sounds or smells. I recall no turns of phrase, no memorable imagery. When I think back on the pages I just read, I feel only a sense of drudgery, and I am ready to forget the one-dimensional narrator who repeats undeveloped thoughts on duality and sameness with little care for the surroundings and development of time that make a long cluster of sentences into a book.. The doppelgänger aspect reminded me of Cloud Atlas, and I wondered what this story could have been in the hands of David Mitchell. Too bad, Pamuk, I had such high hopes for you. Maybe I'll give you another chance one day; but right now the thought of another 150 pages of colorless navel-gazing makes me want to run around in circles flailing my arms.","Jul 22, 2011"
3431786,Lucinda,"Doppelganger novels aren't for everyone; they often have a disorienting, hallucinatory or dream-like quality to their narrative, and the way they unsettle the self/other dichotomy can be, well, unsettling. And confusing.. So, if you want a straight-ahead story with classic plot features and characterization, then you need to look elsewhere. But if you are interested in what happens when the dichotomies of self/other, magic/science, truth/ fantasy, and East/West are collapsed, then Pamuk is your guy and the White Castle is where you need to be. The last chapter had me so thoroughly turned around that I wanted to go back and reread all the previous chapters and rethink them in light of what is suggested at the end (I am one of the readers who doesn't think that the ending settles anything, but based on other reviews there are those who find the ending pretty clearcut).. As a bonus you also get some brilliant wit and sly humor, something which isn't typically a part of the Gothic novel if I am not mistaken.","Feb 18, 2014"
9329323,Pallavi,"This one is the most confusing book I ever read. I had read a review somewhere that not to expect much from this book and let the story flow. I did exactly that and story just flowed, but around me and left no trace of it in my mind. I closed the book and I wondered ""What did I read? "" though it had made perfect sense while I was reading it.. An Italian man is captured by a Turkish fleet and is brought to Istanbul. This Italian meets his ""identical twin"" named Hoja here and is gifted to him as a slave. The book is about this identity and switching/merging/revenging of this identity from this point. I am not sure whether the Identity referred here is physical or mental!. If I will have the time, intelligence, patience in future (maybe when I my teeth are falling and I can't stand straight), I might read it again :P. 3 stars because I felt I am reading ""SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT"" when I was reading it.","Aug 19, 2016"
3007716,Meg,"3.5 stars. I felt the same way reading. White Castle. as I did reading early Kazuo Ishiguro. Ishiguro and Pamuk are both authors that seem to be obsessed with a few key themes. So, if you've already read later works which are more mature and expound upon the same themes in a much more masterful way, the early works, while still good, fade in comparison. Had I read this book without having first read. My Name is Red. , I would've been much more impressed. But I already know what Pamuk can do so my expectations were higher. I know now that if I'm going to work my way through his oeuvre, going forwards rather than backwards will probably be more satisfying.. Still,. White Castle. was a solid, if not amazing, read for me. I love anything to do with the nature of identity and which features dopplegangers. Also, I'm not really sure what really happened at the end, which I enjoy as a sensation.","May 13, 2017"

55792949,Tejas,"The White Castle. by Orhan Pamuk, translated by Victoria Holbrook. Published by Faber and Faber (2000). Rating: ****. This was my first Orhan Pamuk novel. Unsurprisingly, it’s his shortest novel, so it was a great place to begin reading all of his work. Pamuk is an author I have heard several literature geeks tell me about, but not someone I have been able to sit down and read. Pamuk, therefore, topped my list of authors for the year.. This is Pamuk’s first translated work. The translation here deserves credit, for it appears as if the novel is written in English itself – with details so vivid and flow so undisturbed. One wonders what the Turkish version of the book reads like.. The story begins as a straightforward first-person narrative about the misfortunes of a young Italian scholar who, en route from his native Venice to Naples sometime in the 17th century, is captured by Turkish pirates. Brought to Istanbul, he is imprisoned. Having convinced his captors that he was trained in Italy as a doctor, he finds himself called upon to heal everyone from fellow prisoners to a pasha. A man of high intelligence and common sense, he manages in most cases to effect a cure. Slowly, he wins the admiration of the pasha, who presents him as a slave to his friend, an eccentric scientist called only Hoja, a word, he tells us, meaning “master.”. The narrator appears wholly taken by the resemblance between himself and Hoja, a resemblance Hoja appears to ignore. Hoja, as master, commands the narrator to teach him everything he knows from the West – the science, the philosophy.. After a decade, Hoja and the narrator lay bare their past by writing the stories of their lives for each other to read. This exercise leads to both characters, who are entirely identical in appearance, who adopt the mannerisms of the other.. One day the bubonic plague overwhelms Istanbul. Eager to gain further power at court, Hoja conspires with his double to think of ways of reducing the risk of plague through the exercise of Western hygiene. Cats, for instance, are brought in to get rid of the rats that infest the city, although the sultan is told that these rats are really Satan in disguise. The scheme works, and the plague is banished – Hoja is elevated to Imperial Astrologer.. One of Hoja’s enduring obsessions has been the construction of an ultimate weapon — a “war engine” to rout the sultan’s enemies. The sultan now grants Hoja the necessary funds to pursue his hobbyhorse. Some years later, when a war between the Turks and the Poles erupts, Hoja’s expensive and ridiculous cannon is called into action to help in the assault on a glittering fortress in the Carpathian Mountains, the “white castle” of the book’s title. Alas, it can only fail. Hoja knows this, and he escapes from the battle into the fog rather than risk beheading by an irate sultan. In fact, Hoja leaves the sultan’s realm altogether and goes to Venice, to resume there the life of his Italian double, and his slave takes over Hoja’s life as a Turkish sage.. It is at this juncture, that Hoja introduces plot twists and brings into question the identity of the narrator. By the end of the book, you’re left uncertain about who the narrator actually was, and whether or not there were two characters at all.. In this act, lies Pamuk’s greatest triumph. The tale is really simple, the plot development rapid, and the prose, flowing. The twist at the end, however, is sufficient to keep you awake all night. It points at a fundamental question about human nature and human identities – the struggle of understanding oneself. By questioning who the narrator actually is, Pamuk makes you wonder: Why are you who you are? What shapes you? What is your motivation? What is your desire?. These existential questions may not be for all readers. They may also not arise to everyone who reads the book. For example, an alternate interpretation of the book would allow you to ask the question: Does slavery and captivity drive one insane?. Another alternate interpretation would make question the institution of religion and the concept of a value-system.. Whatever questions Pamuk leaves you with, it appears he does so without force. His words don’t point you to definitive answers, nor to mandatory questions. The ease of his narration, and the detail of the characters and dialogue make this an enjoyable, fast-paced read.. A star was docked for the ending. To me, it felt unfinished and incomplete. If this was a deliberate measure, it is one I am yet to fully appreciate. All I know is that I’m going to be reading a lot more of Pamuk, because I’m intrigued by the manner in which he weaves his tales","Jan 21, 2019"
28668057,Jasmine,"[ The question of identity at the end of the book was interesting. I think I like the interpretation better that it was the Italian man that returned to Italy. The actions of the ""narrator"" work better if carried out by Hoja (and indeed also the actions of the sovereign, who seemed to take great joy in understanding two men as independent and very different people, also suggest as much). It doesn't make sense to me that the Italian man would seek company in a slave.. (hide spoiler). ]","Aug 07, 2020"
56337123,Georgina Kelly,"this is a story set in Turkey at the time of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. a tale told by a European slave (or is it?) owned by a morphologically identical Ottoman pseudo-intellectual. the novel looks at a number of the master/slave power dynamics that dominate in that world (and ours). it explores the blurring of old dichotomies such as what is owned and not owned or even ownable, self and other, mystical and scientific, believer and infidel, ancient and modern, East and West. and the struggles around cultural egotism and specificity as the Ottoman East fundamentally denigrates the European infidels while being overwhelmingly attracted to the cultural differences of the West. Curiosity being a dubious quality as association with the West demands assimilation and eventually the ""weakening"" of cultural identity on it's own terms. Most fundamentally however this was a novel examining the ""slide"" of things. if we create narratives of our experience to give the world meaning, then how to keep our footting in the slipperiness of those stories? While ""fundamentals"" such as identity, time, culture, history and memory are no more than stories narrated and disseminated by the powerful, and as they are both the generators and outcomes of individual and cultural expediency, where does any assumption that there is a truth possibly lie? as the European narrator in this novel experiences a dissembling of self and loss of narrativbe meaning when he finds himself enslaved in the Ottoman Empire, so must we experience the dissembling of ourselves in our own storying as we begin to see our meanings as refractions within the expediency mis-en-abime. and is the ultimate proof of ""power"" owning our own or others' stories? do we tell our own lives or do others do it for us? are we all just versions told by an idiot, good or bad, recognisable or not?","Apr 17, 2018"
67077038,Iulia Albota,"I read this book’s ending as a beautiful metaphor and I absolutely loved it, the last two chapters were amazing. Unfortunately, the way up to that point was very difficult.. With only two main characters (the slave and his master) and a third one (the padishah) that appears meteorically, once in a while, with not much plot to begin with (the two scholars simply learn and argue and learn and argue most of the time) the story becomes very quickly terribly boring and the atmosphere claustrophobic and overwhelmingly depressing.. The choice of narrative style is also not my type at all, it’s written as a recollection, almost only “telling”, barely any “showing”. Now that I come to think of it, Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire might be the only fiction book of this sort I ever liked, none other comes to mind. So yeah, no wonder this one was so hard to swallow.. I made a real effort to finish it. I guess it I could call it a good book, all in all, (yes, I’m trying to be as objective as possible) but I feel that I would have truly enjoyed if it had only half the length it has, or maybe even less.

33755471,S Moss,"In a Mirror Darkly. Pamuk’s cleverness, exploiting his unique Turkish cultural heritage full of reminders of the powerful Ottoman Empire, results in a novel that deliberately plays with Western intellectual biases. Starting from the basis that Europeans have long feared the Turks, not least because the Ottomans almost conquered them, Pamuk imagines what a recently captured Venetian slave’s existence would have been like in the 17th century at the height of European fears. However, this is no ordinary captive but an educated man who knows enough to promote his special skills to secure better treatment, and by applying simple Western medical knowledge, he “cures” the Pasha, wins favor, and is turned over to Hoja (master), a Turk obsessed with learning. Hoja is convinced his fellow Turks are ignorant fools, who have no desire to question their learning or be interested in science, the method of acquiring knowledge being developed in Western Europe. His ultimate objective is to interest the young sultan in science, so he will fund and promote scientific research, although to gain that interest Hoja is forced first to propose using science to build an amazing, terrifying weapon.. Part of the novel’s mystery is that the narrator seems to be the Venetian who has written his experiences as a slave, who exchanged clothing with Hoja at the white castle, and returned to Istanbul to live as Hoja. But by the novel’s conclusion it is uncertain whether the Venetian might be simply a creation of Hoja’s imagination in a fabulous tale he has written for his own amusement. The novel’s narrative legerdemain is foreshadowed in the Preface, which purports to tell how this antique manuscript was discovered in forgotten rural government archives by Faruk Darvinoglu. He claims he distrusts history and was attracted only to the story, not any of the “manuscript’s scientific, cultural, anthropological, or ‘historical’ value” (9). He finds historical inaccuracies and surmises the author may simply have “enjoyed reading and fantasizing, may have been familiar with sources….such as the memoirs of European travellers or emancipated slaves…or travel journals” (10). Despite his best searches, he could find no positive trace of the author’s existence, but still enthralled “I told my story to everyone I met as passionately as though I had written it myself rather than discovered. To make it seem more interesting I talked about its symbolic value, its fundamental relevance to our contemporary realities, how through the tale I had come to understand our own time, etc.” (11). A professor friend said old wooden houses were filled with stories of this sort, if they weren’t being used for lighting fires. So Faruk decides to publish the book and begins his translation by reading a couple of sentences from the original on one table, then going to another table in the next room and writing down in modern Turkish “what remained in my mind” (12). It is only by reading Pamuk’s collection of essays called Other Colors, where he describes the novel’s composition, that one discovers the ancient author’s hypothetical process is precisely how Pamuk worked, although probably not running from one table to another to write down what he remembered. In Nabokovian fashion (an author he highly praises in the same book), this speculative preface is real and just as mind-joggling as the misquoted Proust dedication or the ambiguity of the novel’s narrator, who is Pamuk in his various guises, slipping in and out of the two characters in Pnin-like fashion.. It is interesting to read Pamuk’s comments on this work and his life that are contained in the volume Other Colors, essays by Pamuk on his own and other authors’ works, and his views in general, including an interesting interview for The Paris Review. Most useful for this novel are his specific comments on The White Castle, including the array of historical and fictional sources he used to provide the novel’s background, color and authenticity. Using literature on the Ottoman sultans, a few narratives by actual captured Western galley slaves, descriptions of plague in Istanbul, some Polish travel stories about Transylvania and the White Castle, infused with the spirit of E.A. Poe, E.T.A. Hoffman and the fantastic narrative ploys of traditional Turkish story tellers, Pamuk has his novel’s materials. Several recognized literary devices are the idea of the double, which Pamuk pushes to an extreme, but he also plays with the idea of twins who switch identities, using a French author’s report that a European changed identities with a barbarian. In the interview he mentions briefly that the antagonism between Hoja and the Venetian is based upon his complex jealous rivalry with his older brother, who supplies the model for Hoja while Pamuk is the Venetian, a joker who is motivated by exciting adventures. The sadomasochistic encounter between the two, when they face each other in front of the mirror, apparently replicates aspects of Pamuk’s sibling rivalry, which led to estrangement from his brother. But the most interesting revelation is that by the end of the novel even Pamuk isn’t certain who is the narrator, for despite their changing clothes at the White Castle, the narrator at the book’s conclusion seems very comfortable in his Muslim life, while the Venetian had always been restless and wanting adventures, which the one who fled the Turks at the White Castle continued to do, being spotted at various improbable locations doing esoteric jobs.. Thus, instead of a novel about exotic adventures and dangers, which the Venetian captive anticipates writing when he returns, knowing European fascination with “bloody tales of religion and violence, intrigues of love and the harem…strange habits of the sultan” (118), Pamuk creates a psychological novel about Hoja’s divided self and his attempt to synthesize Eastern and Western approaches. Surrounding this introspective journey are fragments of Turkish life, for the most part simple routines of home, market, and school embellished by the sultan’s occasional elaborate celebrations or his hunting excursions which involve forcing small animals to fight each other to the death, while he sentimentally mourns victimized rabbits. Only when the plague strikes the city does a fundamental difference between Muslim and Christian approaches become obvious, for the traditional Muslim views the plague as sent by God to punish the guilty; any person who is a devout Muslim is therefore innocent and need have no fear. The Venetian, with his scientific orientation, realizes it is a disease that doesn’t respect religious conviction and is full of fear when Hoja nonchalantly disregards the danger of contact with possibly sick people.. However, from the beginning hints have been dropped that the Venetian and Hoja, who look the same except for Hoja’s beard, are at least doubles, and as the novel proceeds an intellectual metamorphosis occurs between the two. Hoja had asked for the Venetian as his slave to “teach him everything…all I’d heard and seen…we were going to search together, discover together, progress together” (33). After a half year Hoja has mastered all the Venetian’s knowledge and explores his own projects involving how to calculate prayer times around the world and revisions of Ptolemy’s cosmology. When Hoja tells the sultan he knows astronomy, because one of his main wishes is to establish a house of science to explore nature, this is taken to mean astrology, which the sultan thinks the Venetian has taught him. In order to maintain the sultan’s interest, the Venetian fantasizes all manner of odd creatures which they write down in books, and finally Hoja is obsessed with how “others” like the Venetian think, what is “inside of our heads” (53). As the years pass without any commission from the sultan, their relationship changes, and the Venetian begins to taunt Hoja by claiming those in the West frequently ask, “Why am I what I am?” But all Hoja can respond is “I am what I am” (58). The Venetian then claims “their” progress is “because ‘they’ constantly thought about themselves that ‘they’ had progressed in this respect,” which he regrets because “a person could no more discover who he was by thinking about it than by looking in a mirror” (60). However, Hoja demands that he “must work out who I was and write it down; he would see how it was done, see how much courage I had” (60).. So the Venetian writes his childhood memories, dreams and fantasies, which he tries to get Hoja to do as well. Thus they end up sitting at opposite ends of the Western-style table the Venetian has bought writing their thoughts. By this time the Venetian “already sensed that I would later adopt his manner and his life-story as my own. There was something in his language and his turn of mind that I loved and wanted to master. A person should love the life he has chosen enough to call it his own in the end; and I do” (63). But Hoja is constantly distracted into writing about the reasons the fools he is surrounded by are “so inferior and stupid” (64). The Venetian encourages him to explore his own “negative sides” and he would “find his true self. I had done this, and he (65) wanted to be like me. I could sense this in him” (66). He shows Hoja his sheets of paper filled with “stories exaggerating my own faults” (66). Reading them, Hoja becomes angry “because he could not tolerate the sins of a past he already sensed he would make his own” (66). As he explores his faults, he starts “losing more of his self-confidence and self-respect” (68). When he feels himself contemptible, he can no longer look at the Venetian with contempt. “I thought I had at last found some confirmation of the equality” (69) between them. But the Venetian too has lost his balance, “I wanted to take revenge, to attack” (69); as he’s writing this story he cannot recall any of Hoja’s “confessions that made him feel such self-hatred” (70), which leaves the Venetian (who has taken over Hoja’s life) feeling his past has no realism. At this point the plague breaks out, and the Venetian is terrorized while Hoja remains calm and confident, which shows him he must be innocent, and he claims he’ll teach the Venetian fearlessness.. This key section is interesting as it details the two aspects of Pamuk’s own internal struggle to fuse Western and Eastern cultural approaches, a duality that also reflects the emotional and intellectual duality within each person, where fears, doubts and creativity struggle with orderly, rational, normative processes. The duality of the two men thus has several levels, but what is ultimately interesting is that in the end both will possess both human aspects, perhaps bluntly identified as the Id and the Ego. At first the Id is prominent in the Venetian, until he compels Hoja to examine his own latent Id, which then asserts dominance. The Venetian tries to shatter his “complacency…derived from sharing the same attitudes that others held” (77). Finally, Hoja confesses he “was afraid to die of plague” (78) and forces the Venetian to stand near him in front of a mirror and examine a pustule that might be from the plague. At this point the Venetian realizes “The two of us were one person!” (82). As Hoja forces him to share his fear of the plague, the Venetian realizes “I envied him because he could take action when I could not, because he could play upon the fear in the plague and the mirror” (83). They have become one. Hoja can now see the world as the Venetian did, “he understood how ‘they’ thought…He was going to take my place” (84).. The Venetian cannot tolerate his anxiety about the plague and escapes to an island, only to discover “the temptation of memory” (89) and his longing to confirm if their resemblance was just a deception. Soon Hoja arrives to take him back because the sultan’s interest had revived and Hoja needs his assistance. To deal with the plague they manage to convince the sultan that the rats that bring the plague are emissaries of Satan (so he imports 500 cats from a plague-free city), while they work to restrict people’s movement. They need a story to distract the sultan, with “no moral or meaning other than the pleasure of reading….the ideal story should begin innocently like a fairy-tale, be frightening like a nightmare in the middle, and conclude sadly like a love story ending in separation” (95), which, of course, is exactly how this novel is constructed. After the plague subsides, Hoja become Imperial Astrologer, but by now the Venetian feels “I had become separated from my real self and was seeing myself from the outside…I didn’t even want to learn the identity of this other person I was inside of” (98).. As Hoya moves up in the court, he claims sole credit for their mutual accomplishments and says “there were two types of men: the righteous like him and the guilty like me” (102). His self-absorbed exhilaration about his plans for his weapon make the Venetian think “I was watching myself. Looking at a child” (103). Still the sultan shows no interest, so they poured their “fantasies of defeat and failure” (109) along with the Venetian’s “faded memories” into a book they present to him, and suddenly are told to build their “incredible weapon” (110). For six years they work on the weapon, and when they meet the sultan he assumes the Venetian is responsible: “Is it you who are teaching him all this?” (113). He suspects the Venetian made up the stories and drew the pictures and is interested in him. The Venetian “began to believe that my personality had split itself off from me and united with Hoja’s and vice versa, without our perceiving it” (115). For four years Hoja works alone, struggling to keep his hopes alive, while the Venetian enjoys the pleasures of the palace. He hob-nobs with foreign ambassadors and regales them with exotic tales, grows fat and lethargic, “gave myself over to pleasure, forgetting these hopes of his” (122). Eventually, Hoja too becomes lethargic “because I no longer inspired him” (124).. For twenty-five years they have lived and worked together. By now Hoja’s fascination with “them” (Europeans) consumes him, and he talks to the sultan “of ‘their’ superiority, of how the time had come for us to rouse ourselves at last and take action, of the future and the mysteries of our minds” (127). Since the sultan plans to go to war against the Poles and use Hoja’s gigantic weapon, which awakens terror even though it can hardly be dragged along, Hoja takes the opportunity to question any Christian they encounter about their transgressions. When they reveal nothing unusual, he is convinced they are “withholding the truth…they must have committed sins much more profound, more real, that distinguished them from us” (133), so he would use torture to find it. “He continually repeated that there was a deeper truth” (136). By now they are in the Carpathian Mountains, dragging the cumbersome weapon an","Sep 18, 2019"

5041353,Jim,"This is the fourth book which I have read by Orhan Pamuk. Previously, I read ""Snow"", ""My Name is Red"" and ""Istanbul: Memories of a City"". All four have been quite different. My favourite by far has been ""Istanbul Memories of a City"".. The first page of this book opens with lots of quotes comparing Pamuk with other authors.. ""Comparisons with Kafka and Calvino do not exaggerate;"". (The Independent),. ""He has earned the right to comparisons with Jorge Luis Borges and Italo Calvino"". (New York Times), or. ""...draws comparisons to Salman Rushdie and Don DeLillo"". (Publishers Weekly). I don't find this helpful, I think Pamuk has a unique voice, and whilst I love Kafka, I don't like DeLillo, Calvino or Rushdie and I'm not yet acquainted with the works of Borges.. The White Castle is the story of a young Venetian scholar, sailing to Naples, who is taken prisoner by the Turks and delivered to Constantinople (Istanbul). The Venetian scholar is our unreliable narrator. In Constantinople he meets with Hoja, who bears an uncanny resemblance to him,. ""The resemblance between myself and the man who entered the room was incredible! It was me there..."".. Together they put on a firework display, which impresses the Pasha. Hoja wants to know all about the Venetian Scholar's learning. Hoja is continually ranting about the foolishness of his fellow Turks, even the Pasha and the Sultan.. The plot isn't particularly involving more interesting is how the identities of the two scholars meld together, so it is difficult to distinguish between the two. Together they build a complex weapon for the Sultan, much in the style of Da Vinci's drawings of complex fighting machines. The weapon is heavy and more dangerous to its operators than their foes and eventually ends up mired in a swamp.. A lot of the action is over their work table as they reveal their intimate secrets to each other and argue at length. The two characters may be representative of the duality of the Turkish nation caught between East and West and of the city of Constantinople (Istanbul) which bridges the two cultures.","Sep 24, 2014"
55457122,Halil,"The book named White Castle was written by Orhan Pamuk who was born in 1952. His books are translated into many languages and published in many countries all around the world. The subject of the novel was a scientist, from Venice, who was captured by the Turks in 17th c. At the beginning of the novel, they were travelling from Venice to Naples. Turkish ships crossed their path. Turkish ships were more than them. Other Venice ships ran away from the Turks, but the ship which carried the author couldn’t run away. The author was fond of learning so he went to his room and took a look at his books. Many of people from Venice were used as oarsmen but the author was different because he had much knowledge about mathematic, astronomy and medicine. So they behaved him differently. Firstly, they put him into prison but as he was a doctor, he cured many people. Therefore, his famous spreaded so fast that a pasha heard his name. The pasha was suffering from shortness of breath. The author helped him. One day, the author met a person who is called hodja. His appearance was same with the author. So the book provided us background information. The real events start after this point. As the hodja looks like him almost exactly, some critics say the author sees his own reflection on hodja. I think this makes the book more attractive because when it is being read, it can’t be decided which one is hodja and which one is the author. Anyway, let’s return to our book. The days passed very fast and they became two very close friends. Actually, before being friends, the hodja criticizes the author. He tried to be seen more important and wiser than the author but the situation was different. I can’t give more detail because I don’t want to give spoiler. For me the book was very absorbing. While I was reading the book, my mind was confused and many times I couldn’t decide which one was real hodja and which one was the author. The philosophical relation between events makes me think so much. As a result, I think the book is one of the great books of Pamuk and it must be read by considering two people’s situations.","May 01, 2016"

The content is such that anybody who is well versed with Muslim society can understand the flow of the book, the author/interpreter has done a great job though I found the style of writing a bit mysterious like Turkish culture and Muslim people in general. So I would say I was satisfied by the story and the narration.. Do read the preface, I had to read it two times once at the beginning when I wasn't really paying attention and once at the end of the book. The story goes a bit like this, there is a christian man who has to live in Istanbul for 20 odd years in slavery after his ship is taken hostage by pirates, he doesn't accept Islam and so has to have a master, he is a man of learning and luckily his master is a look alike of himself and was also a former slave and also dabbles in science, astronomy, animals, warfare, you name it they do it. The two live in the master's house, the protagonist describes how he adjusts to a different culture, he kind of forgets himself and likes to walk the city, which he describes as beautiful, an invisible man with just memories of the time he spent with his family.. The book takes a fast turn after about 90 pages and we learn how well he has done for himself professionally and financially, he becomes a free man and marries and even has children. The last part was a bit confusing so may try to read it again someday.. I was thinking how terrified I was as a girl of children being kidnapped and separated from their family. But this book seemed to be about being totally cut off from everything you once knew, strangely the protagonist doesn't much describe any feelings of loss, maybe cos he was older and already away from home. He hardly ever tries to escape after being told that the sultan would find him before he went too far. An unexpected, but kind of nice book. The characters seemed real and I even laughed a few times.","Dec 10, 2011"
2978878,Ernest Junius,"I can see why this book is such an interesting one. Even though I don't think this book is easily accessible, and sometimes Pamuk's prose can be such a devil to read, I think. White Castle. has its charm in its setting and the topic that it covers.. It's all about science and knowledge and renaissance!. I mean how fantastic. Don't we, scholars, always dream to be in the era? Where the world was unexplored, everything was so damn fascinating, and sweet mystery was in the air. When every single day we would talk about the stars in the sky, watching them with amazement and wonder; when every single trip to the shore we would stare at the vantage point, imagining what is it to be to sail and set on another exotic country in the other end of the sea; where we would listen amazing stories from old travelers, soldiers, and gypsies under the bare light of the moon, in the middle of a cold forest. Goddamnit, I mean it would be just so much fun.. I can see, of course,. that. excitement from Pamuk's writing, even though in my personal opinion, he could write with more clarity than what he has done. I find myself struggling for the words in the book, it was such a hard time: every single page is filled up in words that made up a strong fortress wall. There is no white space! Everything's filled up, and I even found it was so hard to breathe. I'm not saying that everybody should be Hemingway, I'm just saying, why should make things harder if you can make it easier. Pamuk's writing feels to me like a mixed up colour palette. I don't know which and which and when was when. The sense of time and place is totally jumbled up, and the pace is running at breakneck's speed.. This book might be more suitable to professors and real linguist scholars. I'm just thinking there should be good editors to edit this writing into something more light and accessible, because. White Castle. is not such a tangled story, not an academic thesis, it should be for everybody!","Sep 04, 2010"
6922605,Greg,"In this short novel, Pamuk takes on the challenge of describing cultural conflict, historical fiction, and then nature of reality and memory. Within the space of 145 pages, he accomplishes these things. The story centers around a European, captured by the Turks, who must learn life as a slave. The quite amazing thing is that his master is a Turk who looks almost like his twin, and the reflecting natures of each other serve as an obvious parallel between East and West. Pamuk asks the reader relentlessly, “Are these two so different?” The answer is, “Not so much.”. The Venetian brings his learning into the Ottoman world, much to the benefit of Hoja and himself. Hoja becomes increasingly upset with those around him, as if the learning he has brought to bare is not understood by those conservative voices around him, jockeying for political power but not the truth. The magnificence of the Ottoman empire comes to be appreciated by the Venetian, and the inability to adjust to the right order of things forces Hoja to yearn for an escape to the Venetian’s life. The duality of the situation of these mirror-image men creates a truly unique, albeit inevitable, situation. How does one detach themselves from their culture and situation? How do they realize the true nature of themselves? How do they recognize this self, and what do they do about it? These are all brilliant questions explored within the context of this historical novel.. Ultimately, we discover how the characters answer these questions. The resolution of the conflict I found mildly dissatisfying, but I couldn’t say exactly why. The resolution does not seem profound, but rather the logical conclusion of the situation. Perhaps that is what Pamuk is trying to say, that life happens regardless of the clarity of your awareness of it, but what matters is whether you see clearly that it is happening.","Dec 07, 2012"
1895570,Jim,"This is a curious little novel about two virtual physical doubles who happen to meet by accident: One is an Italian scholar captured by Turkish ships on the Mediterranean and sold as a slave, and the other is the Turk called only Hoja who buys him. We never learn the Italian's name, because he always speaks in the first person. Hoja becomes a confidant of the young sultan and collaborates with the narrator in coming up with predictions, stories, weapons -- whatever the sultan wants. Although the Italian is well aware that they resemble each other closely, Hoja does not appear to.. From Hoja, the Italian learns that the Turks appear to have no knowledge of science, which they thought of as odd compartments in the head which arrived there by a mysterious process. What the author, Orhan Pamuk, neglects to mention, but which I learned from reading Lord Kinross's. The Ottoman Centuries. , there were no printed books in Turkey until the 18th century -- and this book is set in the 17th century. All Turkish books were copied by hand, whereas the Italian had access to some two hundred years of printed scholarship.. This is the second book by Pamuk I have read -- the first being. My Name Is Red. -- and both have this questing comparison between the Eastern and Western mind as their main subject. In. White Castle. , the emphasis is on science; in. My Name Is Red. , on art (particularly on the Koranic injunction to not reproduce the human figure in art).. Pamuk is acutely conscious of qualitative differences between the Turkish and Western minds. Not only are the compartments different, but also what's stuffed inside of them.","Dec 02, 2010"
1645127,Rumi,"I can't help the feeling that there was something in this book I didn't quite get. Despite this I enjoyed the most part of it because of the enchanting narrating style (which wasn't exactly at its best at the end, I think). I could also identify with the notion of having someone very similar, the feeling that this person is somehow stealing everything personal, even your own life away from you. Though my situation was quite different and happily didn't last for such a long time, at times I felt like Pamuk was telling pieces of my story.. The other idea the book focused on was self-discovery, the chosen way of life of our main characters. There was a personage at the end of the book who noted that, if that's all you ever do, you're not on your way to leading a happy life. And I agree with him - I don't consider myself nearly as fascinating as to dedicate my precious years to studying my character, soul or whatever. Discovering and understanding one's personality is something that inevitably happens to every intelligent person as time goes by, and I suppose it would be more fruitful if it happens without your actual wanting it. The craving for knowledge is not something you could satisfy by sitting in a room and staring closely at yourself. There is a myriad of fascinating things in the world around us, details you can't catch without looking at them with love and excitement. Not to mention that disdain for other people or ""insignificant"" aspects of the world is the single most powerful obstacle on your quest for knowledge and happiness.","Oct 19, 2008"
7824184,Liam Berry,"I was very disapointed by this novel. It started off promisingly and set itself up with a very interesting premise relating to the development of science in a superstitious/religious country where research and validation are almost impossible, instead being traded for mysticism and charlatanism.. I did enjoy the symbiosis of the two main characters up to a point but after a while I felt like Pamuk was shoe-horning it into thet story. He was obviously trying to develop a theme on the nature of identity but his heavy handed approach left me frustrated and constantly took me out of the thread of the narrative. Compared to how Auster can handle the theme (see Book Of Illusions) Pamuk comes across here like a college student attempting to do something he had learned in class that week.. To be fair to Pamuk it's his first novel and it did have some redeeming elements. The way the great and terrifying weapon the Turk develops is only ever descibed through the reaction of the ordinary citizens and soldiers to it, or by its failures and flawed actions, creates it as a void in the text rather than an image. This gives it quite the otherworldly feel, an invisible and yet dominating quality, and this in turn mirrors both the way the civilians and soldiers viewed it and also the way that scientific progress is viewed by a superstitious society.. I do plan on reading more by this author (I've had Snow on my bookcase for a good long while now) but hopefully he will have honed his craft further in the novels he wrote after this.","Jan 24, 2013"
18847085,Hani,"This novel is a mystery and study of man. The two persons who look like each other or doppelgängers are physically same but are not otherwise. Behaviours, views, religion etc. are divided somewhat into an East and West contrast.. Orhan Pamuk writes at one page as follows; ""A few days later he asked if it were possible to make up a story that had no moral or meaning other than the pleasure of reading or listening to it. 'Like music?' I suggested.."". and tells us how an ideal story should be; ""We discussed how the ideal story should begin innocently like a fairy tale, be frightening like a nightmare in the middle, and conclude sadly like a love story ending in separation.'. for me the story was more of the former than the later ideal one. it was a simple music, melodious music.. but as written in the preface ""i suppose that to see everything as connected with everything else is the addiction of time."". Nonetheless, the preface can be confusing because it is written by a character from another novel of Orhan Pamuk. Faruk Darvinoglu of 'The Silent House' so its fiction and confusing.. One paragraph that makes it all worth the read if your looking for meaning rather than pleasure. The paragraph is about defeat. It is on page 109. ""Did we understand 'defeat' to mean...."". and the last gem;. ""must one be a sultan to understand that men, in the four corners and seven climes of the world, all resembled one another?"".

6922752,Chris,"Future Turkish Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk draws heavily on his own highly competitive relationship with his smarter older brother for this curious little musing on the nature of identity that updates the classic tale of ""The Prince and the Pauper"" to Istanbul in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire for a slim but painfully engaging first novel from a fresh young voice before he became mired in the twisted politics of his homeland.. The bland narrator, an Italian scholar captured and brought to Turkey as a slave, brings a unique perspective to this rarefied milieu as he is drawn into an uncomfortable and almost sadomasochistic relationship with his equally uninspiring master, a wannabe Turkish intellectual, and the two set out to outdo and even undo each other in reinvigorating the sick man of Europe with the latest in 17th century scientific advancements.. The novel provides little atmosphere and no dialogue in its often-discomforting recreation of Ottoman era Istanbul that merely serves as a cipher for an exploration of Turkey's search for identity from Atatürk to Erdoðan that has seen it seek to impersonate modern Europe in an increasingly ill-conceived search for a place in the modern world that the debut novelist seems unable to either condone or condemn because he is an integral part of it..

16721173,David Kenvyn,"I don't know what I was expecting from this novella, but somehow I have the feeling that the author of ""My Name Is Red"" should have done better. It is not that the idea for the story lacks interest, and I am sure that someone with a much better knowledge of Turkish history would be able to identify the Sultan, who is one of the central charcters, much faster than me. In the end, I had to look him up to be sure.. So what is the story about. It begins with the capture of a Christian galley off the shores of Italy, and the enslavement of those aboard by the Turks. It follows the story of one slave, who ends up in Istanbul working for a master to whom he bears a strong physical likeness. This master in turn is involved in the affairs of the court, at the time of the Koprulu vizierate, the scheming of the Sultan's mother and grandmomther, and increasing military pressure on the European frontiers of the Ottoman Empire.. And then the plague strikes in Istanbul.. To give away more would spoil the story, which is an illustration of how each individual can play a role that is central in some way to the historical circumstances. This I suppose is why I find the story a little disappointing. It promises a great deal, exploring some important ideas, and for me it did not deliver as much as I think it should have done..

286151,Z,"There is something about Pamuk's writing style that brings me back to his works everytime, even though I feel too much is lost in translation from the original Turkish. The storyline of. The White Castle. is not gripping, though it is certainly interesting enough to make a reader want to finish the book. There is a steady undertone of philosophy that is perhaps more significant than the mundane who-did-what-and-when of an ordinary plot.. An Italian traveller is taken captive by a Turkish fleet and brought to Istanbul where he eventually becomes slave to a Turkish intellectual who, as it turns out, looks identical to him. The ways in which the two men influence each other's lives and contribute to each other's growth over the next twenty-five years or so are slowly unravelled in the rest of the book. However, I can't help but suspect that the original turn of phrase (in Turkish) must be much finer than the English translation, though the latter can't be called bad by any standard.. Pamuk's sharp mind and ability to sift the relevant from the irrelevant are immediately evident, as in his other works. He has a gifted understanding of human nature and the rationales behind seemingly unreasonable human behaviour. For this,. The White Castle. , a short read of barely 145 pages, is definitely worth your time.","Jan 16, 2008"
987367,Karl,"I neither loved nor hated The White Castle. I'd like to give it 3.5 stars, and it may have rated 4 stars, if I could have been a better reader and read the book in fewer sittings.. The issue of identity is cumbersome in fiction and I'm not positive Pamuk nails it here, but he puts in a remarkable effort. The narration is slow, ruminative, and evolving, much like an identity. There are intertwinings of personalities and characteristics, thoughts and histories. In a way, the narration, pardon the simile, is woven something like a kilim -- complex patterns, strands resurfacing in different areas, etc.. The White Castle is very intelligently written, but occasionally, the threads seem to be a little too long, or disappear for too much time. One could argue this reflects the nature of the relationship in the book -- the Italian slave and his Turkish master live so closely together for so long, their influence on one another is so great -- and in a way reflects the influence in an earlier time, as opposed to the faddism dominating today's era.. To compliment this book, I'd like to re-read Hans Erich Nossack's An Offering for the Dead, which I've not read for almost 20 years, and some other (Mitteleuropa?, Kafka, etc.) novels/novellas that approach identity with greater patience than western writers, say like Paul Auster.","Dec 07, 2009"
4760905,Ghada,"The story started off with enthrallment: a young Italian scholar’s ship is captured by Ottomans in the 17th century. He is then taken as a slave by a scholar called Hoja, who demands that he teaches him everything he knows and all that has been taught by “them” (them being the Western scholars). In time, the Sultan begins to take interest in Hoja’s astrological predictions, and appoints him as the Imperial Astrologer. The Sultan asks them to build a giant weapon, which they will later attempt to use in a war to claim The White Castle. However, as the two work together throughout the years, Hoja begins to wonder why a person is who they are, and how he and his slave are who they are. He begins to wonder if they were to exchange knowledge of each others' history and secrets, could they actually exchange identities? Although filled with a mysterious and philosophical air, the book was quite disappointing coming from a Noble Prize winner. After the introduction of the plot, the story kept drifting in and out. There was no proper sense of time. It kept jumping in to the far future without connecting the mid-events. In the last third, it became repetitive and boring. The ending was interesting enough, but it could’ve been written in a more satisfying way.. Overall it was an interesting story. I would recommend it if you like psychological mind games.","Feb 22, 2011"
11265182,Marco,"The book reads, at first, as a classic novel. The first person narrator is the main characters, and everything is seen and described from his point of view. At first, the story is a reckoning of his misadventures (he was a 17th century Venetian, that was captured and enslaved by the Turks). Soon enough the book gets more intriguing. The unnamed Venetian is given in custody to the scholar Hoja, which physically resemble him to an almost sinister degree. The East and the West meet in Hoja's house. They start discussing science and philosophy. They discuss the mysteries of the mind, why we are what we are. Hoja's strongly believes that at the end the Christians European will prevail against the Turks thanks to technological superiority. He strongly recognizes the importance of science, and he laments that its importance is not understood by many others, that he labels ""the fools"". Discussion after discussion, the characters start to blur one into the other, they take the role of the other and at the end it is not even clear which one is the Turk and which one the Venetian. An incredible literary achievement. I am not surprised that the 2006 Nobel Prize for the literature was awarded to Orhan Pamuk "". who in the quest for the melancholic soul of his native city has discovered new symbols for the clash and interlacing of cultures. "".","Oct 06, 2012"
28473132,John Benschoter,"Every story Pamuk writes is somehow about Turkey's duality, it's identity as of both East and West, but yet not of either. It centers on two men who could easily be twins, one from the west, from Venice, a Christian, taken as a slave by the Turks, the other his master, a Muslim, driven by the desire to be taken seriously as a scholar and a genius. The master mocks the stupidity of the pashas and the sultan, telling them the stories they want to hear and that will advance his own way in the palaces and courts. The slave initially takes a stand on his religion, refusing to convert to Islam, but in the end this is a futile exercise as he is stuck in this country a slave with no real hope of ever returning. Both men quite literally face themselves, question their places in the Turkish court, think deeply on their individual histories, but always return to the comfort of their lives together. The White Castle serves Pamuk's obsession on Turkish identity not so subtly. Even so, he sees the trouble in obsessing so deeply, ""To search within, to think so long and hard about our own selves, would only make us unhappy."" These men are not happy. Neither ever finds what he truly wants, a sense of empowerment, a sense of self. Pamuk is a great writer deserving of his Noble. This book is a fine introduction to his work, not as long or dense as My Name is Red, but not as good either.","Jul 30, 2017"
9314075,Carl R.,"I haven't read any Pamuk since the novel that pushed him into the nobel prize--the wonderful Snow, so thought I'd give The White Castle (1984?) a try. What a very odd book.. The premise is that a Venetian soldier is captured by Turkish troops in the 18th century. He is made a slave to a man to whom he bears such a close resemblance that people sometimes have a hard time telling them apart. His master is a consultant to the sultan--something of a soothsayer, astrologer-astronomer, and builder of a great weapon to which he devotes hours and hours. He wants ideas from his slave. He wants to hear every detail of his life in Venice. When the slave has no more to tell, he makes stuff up. Soon neither slave nor master knows reality from illusion. Sometimes they substitute for one another in appearances before the sultan.. The whole thing is a complex experiment in reality-illusion-identity-confusion. Could be intriguing. Trouble is it's repetitious and without momentum. You'd expect to sympathize with this slave who longs for escape--or does he? But you don't Sympathize instead for the poor reader trying to keep up with his circular thinking and narration.. Very disappointing. Should have re-read Snow instead.","Jun 02, 2015"
17669452,Muhammad Syazwan,"I read this book because I was stuck with My Name is Red. I thought I can handle Pamuk just fine but I was wrong. So I researched and found out White Castle is a good start.. Maybe Pamuk just wasn't for me. Or maybe I started with a wrong book. This book is fancy - a vivid description of interplay with intellectual roles and the court, along with infidels. Nothing complex like My Name is Red (which is why it's a good introduction to Pamuk).. I took quite a time reading this book since I always holding it up. The storyline is quirky about two men who are from completely different culture met up in vastly gapping social brackets and how they go on with their lives from one man's point of view. It's introspective - exploring deep inside of what makes up ""an identity"" - and how the struggle for creating, sustaining and defending it is a real struggle and comparable to a two similar person with two different upbringings interact. One thing I noticed was Pamuk is very deep in his research about the sentiments, the culture and the practices of (may be 12th 13th - century?) Islamic Cordoba.. Since the novel I read was a translation I noticed the sentences are too long and sometimes just way too disruptive. It may be working fine in Turkish.","Jan 14, 2016"
577893,GeekChick,"This book is ok. It's a nice light read -- especially as compared to some of Pamuk's other works such as The Black Book.. However, to call this a treatise on the difference in identity between East and West (as the back cover proclaims) is a gross overstatement. Yes, Pamuk's trademark discussion of identity is there, but the ""comparison"" between East/West is flimsy at best. The fact that the two main characters are from Istanbul and Venice, respectively, and that their lives become intertwined, and their identities somewhat interchanged -- this is all fine, but it is NOT a discussion of East/West.. Other than this false proclamation of the book's contents, the book is fine. It's not as gripping as Black Book, though. It's ok. That's about all I can say.. *******Update upon finishing******. The last portion of the book was AWESOME. I said to myself, Now THAT'S why I like Pamuk! Was it good enough to make it worthwhile to read the whole book? I don't know if I'd go that far....It was more disappointing, because I wished the rest of the book was as good as the ending.","Aug 12, 2008"

It concerns me that my new group of readers will hear me talk about things that I so rarely think, but I will inevitably mention needing more to ""happen"" to make me want to keep reading. I often felt that I was reading too literally and had to step outside of the me/him arbitrary separation of the two main characters, but this just got a bit too much for me.. I recently received a rejection email from a magazine, that included the following feedback:. ""the author conjures up atmosphere with a very limited and well-chosen vocabulary. However, on balance, there was not a strong enough core that made us want to turn the page as much as we would've liked."". Ouch.. Not that I'm in any way comparing our work, but this sentiment matches how I felt reading The White Castle. I could have taken out about 50 pages and enjoyed a short novella that was well-written and left me with some things to think about. Instead I'm glad to have finished it in time for book group..

342665,Bookmaniac70,"As always,in this book Pamuk is a great storyteller. Here he meets an Italian and a Turkish scholars who resemble so much each other that in fact they are identical.The mysterious ""Hoja"" wants to understand what makes the individuality of a person. He undertakes various experiments and his final goal is to be totally transformed into his Italian twin.. Is it possible to live another`s life? Is it possible to understand someone fully,as if he is you? What is identity and what defines personality and uniqueness? Those are some of the questions the writer plays with in his book.. It is interesting to pounder over the meaning of the title,""The White Castle"".In the story,this is the castle which the sultan cannot succeed to overthrow,even with the new machine designed by the two scholars.What does is symbolise? Is it the core of personality which cannot be touched,cannot be exchanged?.

1457001,Stephen Durrant,""". . . was it not the best proof that men everywhere were identical with one another that they could take each other's place"" (p. 151). On one level, this is a novel about cultural confrontation, with two characters from very different worlds engaging one another. Among other differences, the Venetian is obsessed with confession, with himself, the other, a Turkish Muslim, always sees the fault in others. But in the end they are a demonstration of the quote above, able to switch places and assimilate into the others world. They are in a sense the same person. Pamuk's narrative is complex and multi=layered. He is, as always, writing about the very act of storytelling and his narrative is nested in a way that makes easy summary difficult. I recognize and admire Pamuk's skill, but I could not concentrate on this story as I struggled with too little leg room in economy class over the Pacific Ocean. Moreover, I have always felt some discomfort with magical realism anyway, even at the hand of a master like Pamuk.","Apr 09, 2010"
2239289,E.,"When Pamuk won the Nobel Prize I put him on my list of authors to read at some point. I found this copy of his first novel for a good price at Half-Price Books. It is a short, quick read. I don't think I've read any Turkish authors before, so I can mark that off my ""list"" as well.. The story is of a young Venetian man captured by Turks during a naval battle, he then spends years as a slave to an official in the Turkish court. It is a deeply psychological novel, exploring topics of identity and personality.. I generally don't care for psychological novels. I much prefer great stories and great characters, and my favourite parts of this book were the elements of story and character, particularly learning a little more about Istanbul and the Ottoman Empire.. The white castle in the title is something of an enigma, but seems to represent a European ideal, which seemed strange (to me) in a Turkish novel. I'm not exactly sure what that was all about. I had a couple of Turkish acquaintances in Oklahoma City, so if I were around them, I'd ask.","Apr 16, 2012"
6804318,Alan Newman,"Read this because I was travelling to turkey--certainly an interesting view at life in the Sultans Court in the 16t C. Actually the book, I believe Pamuk's first, was really about a relationship, this time between an Italian nobleman enslaved to a Turkish scientist/inventor; about the merging of identities between the slave and master who happen to look very much alike; and about the corruption that went with power in the sultan's court. As in the Museum of Innocence, the relationship is obsessive and mutually destructive until the obsession itself becomes oddly comforting. Like Snow there is a sense of claustrophobia and entrapment, in this case due to the enslavement of the protagonist and to the obsession of his master to ingratieate himself to the Sultan. This claustrophobic feeling made Snow, and especially Museum of Innocence hard to read and tolerate--in White Castle, given its historical setting, it is more palatable. This book brought to mind Bergman's Persona and Hour of the Wolf--both about relationships that destroy the self of the weaker character.","May 06, 2012"
17131437,Peter,"I am an Orhan Pamuk fan but this one left me on the cool side. A 17th century Venetian scholar's ship to Naples is captured by the Turks and the scholar passed hand to hand until he becomes the slave of Hoja, an Ottomon scholar who advises the Pasha on scientific matters. Hoja is keenly interested in the Venetian's western knowledge and the two spent lots of time in conversation until the Turk is as well versed as the Venetian. Not only does the Turk's brain become like his slaves, but he is the salve's doppelganger.. Adventure happens and, toward the end, the Venetian is repatriated to Venice. Or is he?. This is another of Pamu's takes on East vs. West, this time is a Spockian mind-melding. I found it beautifully written (a Pamuk specialty), convoluted and obscure (another Pamuk specialty), and a bit strange (three out of three!). Unlike some of Pamuk's books that address the Turkish mindset (""Istanbul,"" ""The Museum of Innocence,"" ""My Name is Red,"") this one is all about the brain..

It's a historical fiction book which is one of the most interesting genre for me,. 4. It's one of the books written by a non-English speaking writer,. But, turns out I didn't. The plot for me was just annoyingly long. I couldn't understand the story even until the half of the book (which then I decided to quit). However, i decided its perhaps not because of the writer. I noticed that Pamuk is incredibly unique and has trademark personality on his writings which made it sounds kinda weird when it's being translated it into other language.

44202419,Sue,"this is the first novel to appear in english by this author i believe. it is about a young italian scholar who is captured by pirates on a journey from venice to naples when captured and auctioned in an Istanbul slave market. the main character is brought by a turkish savant who wants to learn all about the western world, the culture and knowledge he can gain from his servant. At the beginning it is a normal relationship between slave and master, but as time moves on there is a uncanny likeness not just in attitude but also in looks. they morph into one and as the book meanders along with the story things become a blurred line of who is actually who. this story isn't fast paced and you could be sitting in the room with the narrator listening to his story as he paints the picture of his life that it has become in Istanbul, never to return home to the family and land that he once knew. so if your looking for gentle but intriguing/enlightening read then this might be for you.","Oct 10, 2016"
106263,Eric,"More experimental fiction, tho this one tries to be coy about it, masquerading as an historical novel with a unique & interesting premise. An Italian scholar becomes a prisoner in 17th century Turkey & endeavors to remain alive & relatively comfortable thru various strategies, eventually falling under the custody of a temperamental member of the scientific court who uncannily resembles his captive. The relationship that unfolds, with all its attendant head games, violent arguments, & reversals of dominance is fascinating, as is the glimpse of royal politics & intrigue within this antiquated world. But as the story winds down, one gets the sinking feeling that things are heading in the most predictable, unimaginative direction, as if adhering to some preconceived formula that favors symmetry over innovation; some distant concept that may have appeared worthwhile at an early point in the book's development but as it plays out becomes a letdown that leaves you feeling suckered.","Sep 06, 2017"

Oh lord, it was awful!!. At no point whatsoever did it hold my attention, and to be honest I couldn't entirely tell you what it was all about..

26479357,Sergio  Mori,"I got really into it at the beginning; I was fascinated by this story of an Italian slave in Turkey. I liked how it felt almost like a fairy tale: even though there is nothing to indicate that the account is not historical, there is a certain air of fantasy attached to it, perhaps the way it’s written. That, and the fact that there is a person who looks exactly like the protagonist. Once he turns up you just know what’s going to happen: at some point one is going to impersonate the other.. Anyway, the story gets into a narrative muddle in the middle, where you don’t really know where it’s going and you almost don’t care. There is a big chunk that seems a bit like filler, waiting for ‘the swap’. However, I am glad I persevered, as it picks up in the final pages and I actually rather liked how at the end you don’t know which one is telling the story.","Dec 27, 2013"
5614455,Nicholas Beck,"Orhan Pamuk has created a mind melting melange of a tale revolving around ""doubles"" or ""doppelgangers"" or ""switched identities"". The novel to me at least revolves around the ""stories"" we tell ourselves and others about our lives. Fact becomes fiction and fiction becomes fact so much so that the unravelling of the stories becomes almost impossible and so intertwined do the tales end up that the characters or storytellers become interchangeable. The journey or the ""novel"" becomes a maze of intersecting pathways leading in the end to a window that opens up onto a garden of memories but whose memories we're listening to is unclear. After all the story is based on a ""found"" manuscript in the streets of Istanbul from an unknown author and is one of thousands of similar stories in the city. Intricate masterfully written novel.","Mar 29, 2014"

I can admit that there was something about this novel i didn't get, an lacking that could not get wrapped up in it.. Additionally, there is something incredibly off-putting about the central characters; intentionally so, I believe. Their relationship is so fraught with disturbed emotional interdependence, there is an odd air of incest about it (though they are not related, and nothing sexual even occurs). I can't explain it. It made me uneasy, and knowing that I was probably supposed to be uneasy didn't really help.. I have definitely read books where I got to the end and said ""what did I just read?"" and that did not lessen my enjoyment of them at all. This isn't one of those books.","Mar 29, 2015"

At the end Hoja got the slave's life and run away to Italy, while the slave become Hoja/ 0_0 OMG/.. I don't like the stereotype of Muslims in this book.

I didn't enjoy the very, very frequent rages of a certain character nor the conflict between him and the main character. He didn't always feel like a real person. I simply prefer a more show-not-tell sort of novel.. What I did find myself being intrigued by was the young Sultan and his subtly-hinted complexity instead.

The White Castle is well approached with this sense and there is a line which strikes me, it seems to me that this sentence should be based on the nature of this novel: ""I took those dreams that had a sense of motion, after a wake up, to forget everything, to take notes with a poetic langáge, as if like a calligrapher.""

I would recommend reading this novel all at once because stopping for very long caused me to forget details which are brought up later.

I understand the deeper meaning of what the book holds, I thought the narrator's glimpse into his own soul by watching the mirror image of himself in his captor was really a very good idea, but I just couldn't find myself caught up in the story the way I wanted to be. It isn't a long book and yet it took me a lot longer to read it than normal, because I simply couldn't get my attention on the text.

The exploration of the self in this book is masterful, as is the slaveowner-slave narrative (which reminded me of the in-relationship violence from ""Bend in the River"" by Naipaul), but I read a few reviews after finishing this book and wondered if there really isn't a slave in this book (is it a metaphor? is it a split personality disorder?).

The plot took a long time to develop, and most of the book centers around the narrator's relationship with his look-alike/master. The relationship is quite bi-polar, they have many ups and downs. The book touches upon many complex issues, especially in the master-slave relationship, and Pamuk links the narrator's loss of power and freedom to his loss of identity, a good compliment which explains why the narrator seems more emotional and upset over his enslavement than I would have expected. Overall, it is a very deep book that I recommend to serious readers.","Feb 19, 2012"

It is mainly based in 17th century Ottoman Istanbul where the the main characters are the Italian slave and Hoja the Ottoman Turk astronomer.. The author mainly explores questions of personal identity and cultural encounter between the European west and Muslim east.. The story does turn mind twisting as we approach the end..

You can go to some authors with an assurance that they would not only delight you but would even far surpass your expectations for good measure, Pamuk is one such writer. A very rewarding read.","Mar 28, 2015"
59177286,Annamariah,"I am a victim of false advertising, and rather disappointed with this novel. It is not entirely Orhan Pamuk's fault, because after all it's the publisher who decides what to write on the back cover, but unfortunately that doesn't make me like the book any better.. I was promised an adventure with doppelgängers, plague, and lavish parties in the sultan's court, and was immediately intrigued. The story kept me interested for about 30 pages, but the promising beginning soon deteriorated into endless philosophical debate about self and identity, written in long paragraphs without dialogue, which makes the text feel dense.","Oct 13, 2016"
67866144,M. Çağrı Kayabay,"First of all, this book shouldn't be read historically even though somebody accepted that book as a historical novel. Beside, the book includes more than one message. It can be read how a person in the low level can phsicologically gain power over a person in the high level. Pamuk explains that subject through master-slave relationship. Also main subject of the book is the East-West conflict. Superiority of the West over the East has been explained. Science of the West and fatalism of the East... In my opinion, in this book, Pamuk has sharply criticized to ongoing the East-West subject since Ibn-i Rusd and Ghazali.","Jul 22, 2017"
214053,Adam,"A wondrous story of doppelgangers or doubles and the mutability of identity (that I read in double with Nabokov’s Despair) filled with beautiful imagery that reminds me of historical novel written by Dinesen and Kafka. Containing almost no dialogue it is filled with Calvinoesque wit such as this summary of itself on page 94-5, “We discussed how the ideal story should begin innocently like a fair-tale, be frightening like a nightmare in the middle, and conclude sadly live a love story ending in separation.”","Mar 06, 2008"
2220222,Denerick,"I liked White Castle. It was a short book, detailing a neurotic Turk and his Italian slave. The 'similarity' between doesn't really become that important until near the end - when Pamuk unweaves his complex web and all that came before makes perfect sense.. Pamuk is a talented writer. Perhaps the translation may have taken the flow out of the book, and his writing can get a bit dreary at times but his themes and imagery are second to none. I read Snow before I read this but regard White Castle as the superior book.. Imagine what it would be like to swap our lives with someone else!","Apr 14, 2009"
417632,Suzanne,"I didn't find it as compelling as ""My Name is Red,"" though the scientific backstory was interesting, or rather the pseudo-twins' attempts to be scientific . . . It somehow felt longer than ""Red"" (a book some 3 or 4 times its length), perhaps since it lacked the thrust of that detective story narrative (and the art historical angle). It was more about the intrigue of understanding ourselves, though I'm not sure how much the cultures opposed here were really different, a point that is made somewhat obliquely throughout . . . Definitely curious.","Jun 06, 2009"
3967186,Dila,"I loved the characters individually, i loved their thoughts, their inner conflicts. But together they didn't make sense, i didn't get the dynamics of the couple. At some points they bluntly hated and despised each other for reasons i couldn't quite grasp, at other times they had this amazing love for each other. But in the end, it doesn't have to make sense as it is a tale-like fictional book.. This was the first time i read one of Pamuk's books. It was definitely an interesting read. One can easily see how much effort he put in this book. I'm intrigued to read more of his work.","Jul 05, 2010"
5556828,Matthew,"Pamuk writes what seems to be a simple tale of a young Italian academic captured by the Turkish navy who becomes a slave to a young Turkish academic who must act as a consultant to the sultan. As with other Pamuk novels his themes of east vs west, self-identification in changing times, and modern vs traditional are evident throughout the entire short read. Overall I found the book to be engaging and interesting, it is 100% Pamuk through-and-through, and much less complex and metaphorical than his other novels.","Aug 13, 2011"

I don't understand why the translator decided to place only one footnote in the entire book - about the Ottoman traveler Evliya Celebi, who was explained earlier in any case - when so much more could have been usefully and unobtrusively explained.","Apr 02, 2012"

It read a bit like a classic to me, and I enjoyed the memior-like and often lyrical style once I got settled into the writing. I wouldn't call it a page turner, but I loved watching the complex relationship between the main character and Hoja develop and shift, and I thought the big questions the story tugs at (around identity, scientific ethics, what it means to be free etc) were all very thought provoking and interesting.","Apr 05, 2015"

So I continued and I'm really glad about that, because in the end I recognized the good old Pamuk style. and sense for a such thoughtful and intriguing story of two men who shared memories, and in the end... new life..

Very few books strike you intellectually and viscerally as this one.. ""The White Castle"" depicts the absurdity of the human nature in a very sublime, dream-esque way through the words of an unnamed narrator. All this is enhanced by the mere fact that this very narrator is also the most unreliable character of the story.. Beautifully written and highly recommended!","Jan 26, 2016"

At first I found it really fascinating and apart from a few pet peeves (for example the excessive use of exclamation marks which exhausted my reading experience) I did enjoy it. The beginning was intriguing but the middle dragged on a bit for me and I found myself rushing towards the end. I'm not sure why, but I do think there was a lot of repetition going on towards the middle with little action which bored me a little. However, I really did enjoy the last chapter and it gave answers to a lot of my questions.","Oct 31, 2016"

5603048,Jeruen,"This was an interesting book. But perhaps it's also a little bit too academic and theoretical that it wouldn't grip would-be readers of Orhan Pamuk to his style. Hence if you're trying to read Orhan Pamuk for the first time, I would not recommend to start with this book.. Anyway, this novel is about a travelling sailor in the 17th century, coming from Venice, who has been captured by the Ottomans and taken as a slave in Istanbul. He becomes the property of a man named Hoja, who seems to bear an uncanny resemblance to him. They have a master-slave relationship, but sometimes in the course of the book, this relationship flips back and forth. At some time, the reader is now not sure who is the master and who is the slave, since both look very similar to each other, and both know a lot about the other, so each can inhabit the other's personality and pretend to be the other one. And in fact, at the end of the book, somehow the narrator flips, indicating a very unreliable narrator, since in the beginning, the book was narrated by the slave, and now it seems that the book is ending with a narration by the master. The reader therefore never knows if the two characters indeed have exchanged personalities, or not.. I must say however that this book was rather easy to follow, and I wasn't lost at all in the historical aspects of it. But there was still something that I felt was missing. It lacked a certain oomph perhaps, and in the end, I felt like it didn't have enough negative aspects for me to hate it, but at the same time it didn't have enough positive aspects for me to like it either. I felt very ambivalent about it in the end. And I was only glad to have finished it because at some point I would like to read all of the novels that Orhan Pamuk has published.. I am aware that there are several themes running in the book, and if you read the corresponding Wikipedia article for the book, you will learn what they are. I just felt like it wasn't made prominent enough in the book, or if it didn't it appeared as if it wasn't too noteworthy to focus on. My most charitable takeaway for the book was that it was historical fiction, and that I learned a little about 17th century Ottoman Empire. But beyond that, I am afraid that this isn't the most memorable book for me.. I give it 3 out of 5 stars.. See my other book reviews. here. .","Apr 22, 2019"
7056713,Kirk Marshall,"An exactingly-calibrated literary Rubin’s vase, this standalone novella is essentially a deconstructed. Italo Calvino. fairytale about doppelgängers, synchronicity, proto-psychoanalytics, the master/slave dialectic, and the mutability of identity during the seventeenth-century apogee of the historical Ottoman Empire and the Ottoman-Habsburg wars, as conjured with the ceaseless self-interrogating reportorial recursive philosophising of. Javier Marías. .. It works immaculately as *both* and *simultaneously* the first-person retrospective epistolary narrative of a seafaring Venetian scholar (“I”) captured and installed under the thrall of an amateur Turkish Muslim nobleman astrologist (“Hoja”) with courtly aspirations; and as the meta-fictive narrative of that same Turkish Muslim nobleman assuming and fabricating and reconstructing wholecloth the purported biography of that wayward Venetian scholar.. What results is a kind of bi-refractive literary looking-glass or *mise-en-abîme* in miniature, where the causality of the storytelling is inseparable and indissoluble from the ‘authorial’ perspective of both protagonists (even if reading the tale ‘one way’ inverts and cannibalises and disauthenticates the other in entirety).. A cyclical storytelling ouroboros which also manages to culminate in a visceral meditation of the engineering of a supersized three-dimensional Rorschach inkblot test in metallurgic iron as a tangible apparatus for siege warfare (via pre-Jungian brinksmanship exercises), Pamuk here is in a league all his own. And it works just as well if you re-designate this as either an apocryphal great lost Calvino or Marías book.. Highly recommended (ergo: 4.5/5). Thereafter go mainline a contrapuntal screening of Tarsem Singh’s. The Fall. (2006) — or Kurosawa’s. Kagemusha. (1980), for that matter — as a cinematic chaser.","Jun 24, 2020"
22170693,Жибек Айсарина,"The White Castle by Orhan Pamuk is terribly short for a work that reveals insufficiency of Decartian statement ‘I think, therefore I am’ which states that the necessary condition of the existence of a ‘self’ is an eternal questioning of its presence. Orhan Pamuk goes beyond Decartes in claiming that the ‘self’ could become a prey for external intervention, if the thoughts containing it are not under constant examination. Because, after all, if the peripheral factors influence the ‘self’ they become projected on it and the thoughts become diluted with the other ‘self.’ Although, the connection between ‘self’ and ‘the others’ can take different forms, the writer takes the most extreme case, that of master-slave relationships as the basis of his novel. The writer engages identities of an educated young man from Venetia who later becomes a slave and an Eastern intellectual from a poor background, Hoja, who becomes, roughly speaking, an adviser to Padishah.. The Venetian slave is introduced as an extremely smart Christian man approximately at the age of twenty-three, who does not, however, get called by a name. Perhaps, by doing so Pamuk points at slave’s objective condition towards Hoja, marginalizing him to a state of an object that does not need to be differentiated from others by a name and far less by an identity. Taking into consideration the slave’s state, the readers are expected to be aware of the potential need for a ‘self’ that would objectify the Venetian man, thereby perfecting incompleteness of his identity. The fact that Hoja and the slave physically resemble each other, becomes an interest for the surrounding people and a source of anxiety for the Venetian man. Because right at the moment when Hoja enters and the slave sees a projection of himself in Hoja, he pronounces to the readers ‘As he sat down facing me, I realized that it had been a year since I last looked in a mirror.’","Feb 27, 2018"
69444656,Vel Veeter,"This is the first novel by the Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk, who I learned about with many other people when he won the Nobel Prize about 15 years ago. This is the third book of his I’ve read now along with My Name is Red, which is quite similar or shares similarities with this book, and Snow, a contemporary novel not all that much like these too. In this novel, we meet a young Italian scholar in the early Renaissance who is captured by slavers, and because of his status as scholar, given over to a Turkish scholar, who turns out to be his exact double. These two men, linked by their love of learning and scholarship as well as their physical appearance, create a paired bond despite or maybe because of their cultural separation from each other. There’s just enough difference to link them, rather than repel them, as often happens in doubles stories. They work together for years and years for the sultan, and when it seems all is over and done, begin to question their nature and relationship to one another.. The confluence of several motifs I’ve been reading recent weeks, this book involves both a double and a “forgotten manuscript” both of which are tropes that I have mixed feelings about. I think I like doubles better, because they allow for more primal fears. However, I think that linking “found manuscripts” to how we think about “found footage” might allow us to think about what this trope does and doesn’t do. It does give the document both a feel of verisimilitude, while also making it seem more artificial. Sometimes I think this linking of the authentic to the fabricated is intentional, and sometimes it’s unintentional. Where it’s intentional, I think it adds depth, and where it’s unintentional, it weakens the effect.","May 08, 2020"
63117571,Shihab Ullah,"'The White Castle' by Orhan Pamuk is an usual book - 'unusual' in the sense that you can argue that it did not follow the different stages of the classical structure for a novel such as exposition, rising action, climax, falling action and resolution. Rather, there is a melancholic monotonous tone throughout the whole storyline. Published in 1985, the book depicts the story of a European slave and his Turkik master in the backdrop of 17th Century Istambul. It's a story where East and West are mirrored at each other with marvel, a story of knowing each other and gradually becoming one another. Pamuk exerted extensive efforts to develop the characters of the two protagonists, laying down carefully their fears, dreams and aspirations of becoming the other - the foundation that led the story to closure. Pamuk reminded me of Kierkegaard (the father of existentialist philosophy) many times as I was pacing through the book - even though the essence of the book somewhat contradicts with it in so many ways. The following quote from the book somewhat captures Pamuk's underlying thought behind the concept of the book -. 'must one be a sultan to understand that men, in the four corners and seven climes of the world, all resembled one another? Afraid, I would say nothing; as if to break my last effort at resistance he would ask once again: was it not the best proof that men everywhere were identical with one another that they could take each other’s place?'.. Verdict: it's an interesting book with some unique insights - at times, may feel like a struggled read.","Mar 04, 2020"
1525867,Adam,"I really enjoyed Pamuk's nonfiction; this is the first fiction of his I read, and it was great. The story is eerie and surreal and its construction is clever. It seemed to me a fresh take on the old theme of Istanbul's identity between the so-called East and West. The Italian and Turk--they are so much alike; or are they in fact the same, or do they become one another?. I got chills reading the following passages:. ""Putting his hands on my shoulders he came forward and stood next to me. He acted like a dear old friend who had shared my deepest secrets. Squeezing the nape of my neck from both sides with his fingers, he pulled me towards him. 'Come, let us look in the mirror together.' I looked, and under the raw light of the lamp saw once more how much we resembled one another. I recalled how I'd been overwhelmed by this when I'd first seen him as I waited at Sadik Pasha's door. At the time I had seen someone I must be; and now I thought he too must be someone like me. The two of us were one person. This now seemed to me an obvious truth. It was as if I were bound fast, my hands tied, unable to budge. I made a movement to save myself, as if to verify that I was myself. I quickly ran my hands through my hair. But he imitated my gesture and did it perfectly, without disturbing the symmetry of the mirror image at all. He also imitated my look, the attitude of my head, he mimicked my terror I could not endure to see in the mirror but from which, transfixed by fear, I could not tear my eyes away; then he was gleeful like a child who teases a friend by mimicking his words and movements. He shouted that we would die together! What nonsense, I thought. But I was also afraid. It was the most terrifying of all the nights I spent with him (82-83).. And moments later: 'Now I am like you,' he said. 'I know your fear. I have become you!' I understood what he was saying but tried to convince myself that this prophecy, half of which I know have no doubt is true, was silly and childish"" (83-84).","Dec 31, 2017"
11375487,Lit Folio,"This is a first read of this Nobel awarded author. As I've traveled in Turkey and spent much time marveling at the wonders of Istanbul, I very much looked forward to taking up this read. Firstly, it's compelling writing that engages and almost entrances, it's so lush and vividly descriptive. But what does this odd story within a story really say in the end? I scratched the proverbial head as I flipped its pages back and forth to determine what it was that I seemed to have missed. I came up empty handed.. There's much window-dressing here around a narrative that just doesn't happen. Nothing is revealed or made clear. This is why I give it a so-so rating. To wit: the brilliant and under-read genius of Paul Auster--who often builds existential mazes in his novels, but always, the prose is crystal clear and clarified further in their respective denouements. Not so with Mr. Pamuk. His seemingly deliberate obfuscating tactics only end up annoying, at least, this reader, by story's end. One thing I found fun was the telling of the pandemic--a Bubonic-like plague that descends upon the land. Rather good timing there. But all in all, in spite of its touches of dark humor and compelling prose, this read amounts to a disappointing exercise in contrivance and fanciful artifice that just doesn't deliver. However, I will explore his other works with the wish that this is a stand-alone scenario. Fingers crossed.","Jul 12, 2020"

51033483,Enzo,"The main theme of this first novel by Pamuk is the ambivalent relationship between assertion of identity and ambiguity, personified by the two characters in the plot. They start their journey in the story from opposite ends, one in Italy as a promising scholar who gets made prisoners by the Turks, one in Turkey as a scholar close to the court of the sultan who takes the Italian as his Slave, attracted by the idea of what he could learn from him. Throughout the book the roles of Master/Slave, Teacher/Student ambiguisly alternate between the two characters and surely the end of the novel does not give the reader any clarity on where the two men stand or if, indeed, we have two people involved in the story. Very intriguing way of constructing the architecture of the book but I do not think it really works as a masterpiece of literature. What happens inside and around the two characters does not have enough depth to entertain the reader throughout the book. Surely Pamuk has been able to develop his clear talent as a writer in subsequent works, while this one shows us his mastery in pulling together a good plot.","Dec 02, 2017"
4430576,Miri,"Two and a half stars if not three, but right now I can't bring myself to rate it higher because of how unenjoyable I found the book right up until the last few pages. There ended up being some interesting philosophical exploration, and the plot is a great one—Italian scholar in the 17th century is captured and sold in a Turkish slave market, spends the rest of his life in a weird unequal partnership with a man who looks enough like him to be his twin, inventing weapons and stories for the child sultan—but I found the characters very unlikable. They're obsessed with the concept of identity, of how a person can ever really know themselves, and yet for all their years of constant introspection and self-examination, they don't seem to learn or grow in any way. The selves they're so obsessed with are entirely superficial; everything's about their appearance, as if the fact that they look alike is really all it takes to make them the same person, and they never reach a single thought beyond the surface of the mirror. Pretty boring stuff.","Sep 22, 2018"
4849602,Ann,"Enjoyment-wise I would rate this as 1 star because I really did not like it at all. However, it was not trash and I usually reserve that rating for books I’m mad at. This is. Literature. , but it was not a book for me.. As I was reading it, I wondered is this book really that dry, or was it the fault of translation? Is there a bit more poetry and flow in the original? I could not visualize. anything. here - it was like reading an instruction manual. When I cannot conjure up images as I read, I have a terrible time getting through a book.. I trudged through this one though, and eh. I see some of what it was this was going for, but I wasn’t engaged. This is a very deliberate literary exercise on self/other, East/West, master/slave etc... and it felt forced and clunky. Perhaps in an academic setting I would have gotten more out of this, but reading it just for myself was unrewarding.","Sep 17, 2018"
85867591,Archana,"A European traveller is being caught captive when the ship he travelled in was seized by the Turks.. He is then bought as a slave by an aspiring frustrated Turk scholar who resembles him in appearance, for teaching the latter, European concepts in Science. Slave and master then embark upon far-fetched fantastical and failed efforts to bring about discoveries and inventions in science.. Through the process, their characters seep into each other, mirroring each other and finally the 2 men end up switching their personalities and lives.. Orhan Pamuk is like a serious, thoughtful, warm uncle that we have, who tells us stories. And smiles in appreciation when he sees us listening. Going through his book, one feels like mostly he is reminiscing aloud, events from his life, sometimes even unaware of our presence.. Pamuk has a way of foretelling events, people we would meet again through the book. Have seen this approach in his other works also. You would think it kills the suspense, but it does not. Rather it gives the promise that, the effort put in to probe this particular character or event is not in vain, he is definitely appearing again, but how, we have to wait and see.. Compared to his other works, I did not find White Castle much gripping. There was much repetition of ideas, many pages where nothing happened and the same scene or thought were repeated.. The idea of the personalities of 2 people mixing so much that they themselves fail to identify one from the other, did not feel as disturbing or convincing as the book rightfully should have.","Sep 26, 2018"
7916764,Carolyn,"Most simply, the story at the core of this novel is set in the 1600s and tells of an Italian man, taken prisoner and enslaved by Turkish sailors, eventually sold to a wealthy, educated man who bears a quite remarkable physical resemblance to himself. There is, in fact, such a strong resemblance that they eventually trade places -- the master becomes the slave; the slave, the master, and nobody is the wiser. But a more philosophical aspect is the consideration of exactly how well a person might know the true self and the possibility of knowing another person so intimately that an indiscernible trading of places could be possible. What is the meaning of personal identity? What makes each of us unique? Or are we?. Incidentally, it's also a fascinating look at the world of that geographic location in that time. And I enjoyed the confusion generated by the opening pages and those at the closing that makes the reader question even more about the story.","Jan 28, 2019"
11769752,Mia,"“we finally saw the castle itself. It was at the top of a high hill, its towers streaming with flags were caught by the faint red glow of the setting sun, and it was white; purest white and beautiful. I didn’t know why I thought one could only see such a beautiful and unattainable thing only in a dream.. In that dream you would run along a road twisting through a dark forest ... but although you expected to reach the end of the road at any moment, it would never end.”. This quote perfectly describes what it’s like to read this book. You think you know who the narrator is, but the closer you get the more winding the road becomes until you realize that you never can know.. This was my first foray into magical realism. I expected there to be more magic and less realism but was pleasantly surprised to find that the magic mostly rests in the feeling that entraps you while you read. I did, however, feel at times that there was some mysticism lost in translation.","Mar 23, 2019"
57995817,Sue,"1,5 stars! Snore fest! I really forced myself through this book. Actually the core idea of this book sounded interesting: the Ottoman life through the eyes of a Venetian intellectual slave who looks exactly like his master Hodja. However, the execution of the idea is so dull, simple and boring. The inner struggles are not mature enough, the characters are non existent and almost like caricatures. It could have been amazing if the thin line between being a master or slave had been written better. This is a historical fiction book and one shall expect a fascinating world-building and an amazing atmosphere. The author fails big time in setting an atmosphere and building a world. You don’t feel the historical side of the story. There are so many wrong facts: the Sultan’s grandfather is his uncle in real history, or the observatory claimed to be forgotten was actually destroyed by cannons. The prose is too simple, the language is dull. It is one of the most amateur books I have ever read.","Aug 14, 2020"
40790789,Tanveen Bhasin,"Highly OVERRATED!! A short book, just 161 pages but it still took me a month to complete it. There are some books which you can't just drag yourself to read, for me, this was one. Started it very enthusiastically, but ended it dreading that I had wasted my whole month. After finishing the book my only concern was what the hell was this man trying to say? What really is the story and what was the mania throughout the book all about? The book starts well, ends well, but what it is in the middle is utter nonsense. It is basically that the author had a very little story with him and stretched it like an elastic for no reason. The concept which the book claimed to explore of exchanging identities, is hardly explored rather some other mania is going on. For me this was a total disappointment. I don't think I would ever have the courage to read another book from this Author.","Nov 29, 2017"
85414667,J,"There’s no getting around the fact that The White Castle was at least a little bit boring. I’ve read bits and pieces of Istanbul, which I borrowed from my school library a few years back, and absolutely loved it—the language, the story, the melancholy, the photographs—which only makes my disappointment in this one that much bitterer. I’ve read a few books about the Ottoman Empire (I say “read”; hopefully one day I’ll actually finish one) and I think this ranks far below both Elif Shafak books I’ve read, and below the And I Darken trilogy, too, which is sad to say, because as much as I adored And I Darken, I’m a Middle Easterner and a staunch Westernophobe. It hurts to give an American writing about Turkey a higher score than an actual Nobel Prize-winning Turk. I promise. It hurts. But what can I do? This one just didn’t do it for me.","Jan 20, 2020"
46431604,Julie Nortillo,"Born in Turkey and hearing reviews of Pamuk's other novels, I expected more. Weaving an intricate story between Hoja and the Italian scholar wasn't truly was occurred here.. I found Hoja to be quite a savage at many points in the story but then when the scholar had an opportunity escape, he a) chose an obvious hiding place and then b) didn't! The story was not very interesting; the best part of it was the narrator telling stories upon stories upon stories. It even ended with his 16 year story read by a visitor! (at least it only took me 9 months to push through this very brief novel, not 16 years though it sometimes felt that it may!).. Pamuk received the Nobel Prize for literature so I will attempt another novel of his but I was definitely disappointed in this.","Jul 09, 2018"
41481848,Elizabeth Stephens,"Placed in Istanbul sometime at the height of the Ottoman Empire, the setting and time period was the only thing that I really could be said to have enjoyed about the novel, that I found interesting. Unfortunately, the one dimensionality of the first character was a major stumbling block for me in reading the book. For a book to reflect mostly on the self, that individual on whom I am forced to reflect should, at the very least, be interesting. Likable is not a requirement, but interesting is a must. Not only this, but the writing style was equally flat. It was painful to continue reading and I would have stopped had it not been a requirement for my book club.","Jan 08, 2018"
11862459,Ann,"I was skeptical about the reviews likening Pamuk to Kafka, Nabokov, Borges, but it was truly uncanny how similar this book was -- it was hard to believe I wasn't reading actual excerpts from any of them at one time or another (I'd also throw in Calvino). It's a winding, dense novel, reflected even at the sentence level -- while I got kind of tired reading page after page after page of looong relative, subordinate, and dependent clauses, this style forces the reader to really ruminate on the the strange dynamic between Hoja and the Venetian (although then again, it was probably the translation). Worth another read.","May 23, 2018"
86560754,Andreea Bitiusca,"Not among the greatest literary achievements of Pamuk. In his other novels that I read, I was a defender of the long details, explaining how this technique,. although boring , served a greater purpose, by creating real museums of heart felt information about how people think, love, live, talk. But in this book, it was quite difficult to see the same.. Nevertheless, what I considered interesting was the quest for identity in a "" dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde"" way, the theme of the double, of the soul mates.. Another good thing about this book is the ending which can prove itself very intriguing if you let yourself carried by the motion and the philosophical atmosphere.","Feb 02, 2019"

And I have always wanted to read more of Pamuk's writings.. And so I started off with very high expectations. And I felt miserably disappointed for the longest time. It is slow and stodgy, and took me forever to read, considering how short it is. Notwithstanding, the resolution does make up for it, and is quite satisfying in the end. I would not recommend it to everybody. But it does offer some very interesting perspectives on the nature of human identity, and how it can often evolve.","Jul 06, 2019"

Though fewer than 200 pages, the book was a tough read for me because of Pamuk's style of writing.

I also thought there would be more of the ""magnificent machine""but it was really only hinted at and briefly mentioned in the end.

Listening to the analysis of his novel from the mouth of the writer and being able to easily observe how the control of the work is out of hand, his references, the resources he uses, strengthens the connection between the writer and the reader at the end of the book.","Apr 11, 2020"

66836903,Donnie,"The White Castle is an historical novel, by Orhan Pamuk.. The story is introduced as an old archived manuscript found currently in Turkey. The manuscript tells the story of a young Italian who is captured by Turkish troops while sailing towards Napoli in the XVIIth century. The bright youngster realizes he should be perceived as valuable to avoid more unpleasant living, and successfully impersonates a medical doctor. After gaining trust from authorities, he is sold as a slave to a man known as the ""Master"", who is physically identical to him although nobody acknowledges it. The Master makes the protagonist help him to develop scientific advancements, often mixing them with astrological and mythological stories in order to convince the authorities.. Most of the book depicts the ups and downs in the relationship between both men. The Master needs the Italian, but shows contempt towards him (which we don't know if its true, as the novel is narrated by the Italian). The Italian desperately wants to escape, but is unable to take the needed actions. He stays so long in Estambul that he starts forgetting his previous life and starts having delusions about him and the Master being the same person.","Jul 12, 2020"

Hoja is by far the most interesting character, I could never quite work out if he were a genius or mentally disturbed. Couldn't quite work out whether he was good or bad.

7404844,Madeline,"It took me a few years to finish this book. I began reading it shortly after turning 16, not long before I moved to Turkey. It is Pamuk’s shortest novel (by far) and I figured that reading the country’s most prolific writer would prove insightful before I arrived. I am not ashamed to say that I bit off way more than I can chew. I frantically read and reread passages, trying to understand What The F%₺# was going on, until I was about a third of the way through, and I could no longer pretend. I abandoned my pride and the book. Don’t get me wrong, the writing is beautiful and the setting is utterly captivating, but Pamuk was moving in six different directions at once and I wasn’t able to keep pace. Fast forward a few years. I’m older, I have more reading experience, and I had spent a significant amount of time in Turkey without finishing a Pamuk novel. I decide to give this another go before attacking one of his longer books. I still think that a lot of the finer details of the story were lost on me, however I thoroughly enjoyed his exploration of identity.. The Republic of Turkey has, in many different ways and from its inception lasting to the current day, continuously battled with its identity. What I appreciated most about Pamuk’s take on the subject was that he completely refused to turn to the simplified and overdone “East vs. West” trope. Of course it is part of the equation, but this novel goes much further, asking more questions and leaving fewer certainties.","Jan 30, 2016"
4567704,L.S. Popovich,"This book was exactly the right length. It was refreshing to stumble upon this one as my first Pamuk read. A novel doesn’t have to be complicated to be good. All I want from a novel is an original story well-told, something that allows me to escape the mundanity of everyday life. Pamuk channeled medieval Turkey well, as he would consistently do in his other books. But this volume was not bogged down by unnecessary details. Each part of the story fed into the other parts. It was subtle and engaging. There was absolutely no dialogue from what I could tell and he blatantly violated the bogus rule of “show don’t tell.” The entire novel reads like someone telling something that happened over the course of time. It was straightforward and managed to seem elegant even though he didn’t do anything special. I later found out that Pamuk is at his best when he doesn’t try and do anything fancy.. I went on to read the rest of his novels (except Snow) and this is the one that stuck in my memory the most. The Black Book was more mesmerizing, but this is the one to start with if you're new to Pamuk.","Nov 19, 2017"

4453364,Yara Zeitoun,"One of the most beautiful and melancholy books ever. Orhan Pamuk is incredible and uses such detailed insight -- the historical portrait of Turkey that he paints with his words is just beautiful, as well as his understanding of a human's struggle with identity.. ""When I tried to think of something else, the scene through the window overlooking the garden behind our house came to life before my eyes: peaches and cherries lay on a tray inlaid with mother-of-pearl upon a table, behind the table was a divan upholstered with straw matting strewn with feather cushions the same colour as the green window-frame; further back, I saw a sparrow perched on the edge of a well among the olive and cherry trees.""","Aug 28, 2011"
27801480,Mayavie ,"You know how they say that after a long companionships, couples start looking alike? Some even say the humans start looking like their cats/dogs. In Orhan Pamuk’s A White Castle, a Turkish master and his Venetian slave are brought together by a Pasha because they look alike. Over the years the physical similarities diffuse into other areas of their personalities in that sometimes they don’t know whether the thought they have in their head is their own or their doppelgänger’s. This fever dream of a novella discusses issues or identity while the protagonists deal with questions of astronomy, astrology, philosophy in a beautifully embroidered historical fiction setting.","Jun 22, 2020"
1532590,Zach,"The White Castle is more of an interesting book than an enjoyable one. Boiled down, it is a rumination on the nature of identity and the inner workings of the mind. It's rendered in simple and straightforward language, but I thought, especially in the middle of the book, that the thought processes were muddled. I don't know if this is a result of the translation or something lacking in the original. Pamuk seems like a perfectly capable philosopher, so I give him the benefit of the doubt. I'll probably try to read another book by him before I decide what I think of his style.","Jun 12, 2011"

Using his scholarly mind, he manages to secure himself a safer position other than construction worker, he soon finds himself working as an assistant under another scholar who happens to looks just like him..

16914032,Brigitte EVHS Dang,"I was recommended this book by a friend who is an avid reader of Pamuk. That being said, I really did not think much of this book. I enjoyed the time setting- the Ottoman Empire is fairly uncommon- because it gave it a sort of fresh feel. However, I found it hard to enjoy the way the characters were portrayed. I did appreciate Pamuk's depth of identity exploration and his incorporation of psychology. Pamuk's storytelling is definitely intriguing but the ending felt a little unsatisfying.","Feb 12, 2015"

51485396,Neli,"I was surprised to see that for someone who is writing in XX century, his books sound like they were written in XVIII. Yes, I can see why he won the Nobel Prize in literature. Orhan Pamuk is one of these writers that can combine new and old style and put a lot of meaning in his stories. In ""The white castle"" he talks about history, traditions, knowledge, about the West and the East, and, of course, the meaning of life. Fine book, indeed. But not my kind of literature.","Jan 17, 2016"

The plot revolves around the idea of identity, and all of its different facets. What happens when people are together for years, decades? How do their perspectives change, align with each other, repel each other as time passes? There's a lot to do with memory as well, and it's role in shaping who we are.. Check it out!","Jan 20, 2016"

I am glad did not, as I got to experience his intent in gathering the narrative very tenaciously, like a slow boil, toward the end.. Not to draw too much of a comparison to Roberto Bolaño or Paul Auster, but simply to say that Pamuk's style occupies a similar space. Could be a better choice for an autumn read when the nights are long.","Mar 03, 2016"

597461,Elyse  Walters,"DIG and RUN!!!!!! ........ I became transfixed by thoughts, questions, opinions, and judgments about Cem --- taking the train back home to Istanbul when he did... at the end of Part I of this story.. There are three parts to this novel. Each are different-- related & connected, but different. The novel comes together brilliantly at the end..... but this is one twisted story!!!! My goodness!. A familiar lovelorn pursuit, took me back to ""The Museum of Innocence"". Similar to ""The Museum of Innocence"", I was expecting deluded hopes for 16 year old Cem, but the bigger surprise, was when things took another path. The Red-Haired Woman - much older -reciprocates in an evening of sexual escapades.. Cem is a well- digger apprentice for a *MASTER* Mahmut on the outskirts of Istanbul. The 'master' is domineering, very strict, and expects Cem to obey his orders - DO AS HE SAYS!!. Often - in Orhan Pamuk's books - there comes a moment when it feels like 'nails-on-the-chalkboard' for me: DIGGING & DIGGING & DIGGING......if you've 'ever' had fantasies about being a well digger.... haha -- this book should end that fantasy!. But.... all digging and work without a little fun for a 16 year old boy - would be a killer -- so-- Cem finds 'enjoyment' resting under his favorite walnut tree - and visiting the traveling ""Tent of Morality Tales"", with lust to watch The Red Haired Woman perform.. However- even though Cem was melting in 'sexual- love- heaven' from having lost his virginity..... an accident at work sends Cem skipping town.... he leaves his Master at the bottom of the well whom he presumes to be dead. But is he?. Dig and Run. Back in Istanbul, we get a modern experience of the city, bookstores, cafés, the University which Cem becomes a geology student...and gets married.. Thirty years later -- his incomplete life comes back for a visit..... TWISTED -- twisted twisted twisted...... and very enjoyable!!!. 4.5.....I took a 1/2 mark off.... because if I had to keep experiencing the DIGGING, I thought I was going to die of thirst and or scream!","Aug 31, 2017"
3643764,Esil,"3.75 stars.. In the late 1980s, I travelled to Turkey with my soon to be husband. We had just finished university, had little money and were in search of adventure. It was certainly an interesting trip and we have often talked about going back to Turkey, but I am also aware that traveling in a country when you don't know the language and have no real means of getting to know people isn't really a great way to get to know a country.. This was my first book by Orhan Pamuk. But I feel that the two days spent reading The Red-Haired Woman gave me a more intimate look at Turkey in the late 1980s than my trip of almost 30 years ago. The narrator of this novel recounts the summer when he was 16 years old, working as an apprentice to a well digger in a small town outside of Istanbul. While getting to know the master well digger, the narrator also becomes fascinated by an older red-haired woman. Move forward thirty years, and the apprentice is a wealthy businessman in a much changed Turkey, but he is not freed from what happened the summer when he was 16 years old. Reading The Red-Haired Woman feels like a rich multi-layered experience. Pamuk delves into Turkey's political situation, mixing in history and mythology. There's also a bit of a mystery and some moral complexity. This wasn't quite a 4 star read because it didn't always hold my attention, but I did mostly enjoy reading it and especially I appreciated the opportunity for what felt like an intimate view of contemporary Turkey. Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy.","Aug 24, 2017"

She encourages him to write his father's story, which explains how the first two parts came to be written. (hide spoiler). ]","Mar 12, 2019"
5407952,Jibran,"Life follows myth.. So it does.. The story draws upon two ancient myths. Sophocles’. Oedipus Rex,. in which the son kills the father (unknowingly) and Ferdawsi’s Rustam and Sohrab taken from The Persian Book of Kings. Shahnameh,. which is a reversal of Oedipus Rex in that it is the father who kills the son (again, unknowingly) and the string of events that lead to both deaths and the consequences the murderers face for their sui generis crimes. The two contradictory yet complementing myths become the parameters in which the story of the eponymous Red-Haired Woman and her accidental lover is set.. This is by no means a retelling or adaptation of the either myth; quite the contrary. Here the protagonists are very conscious of the power of the afore-mentioned myth, study it, research it, try to steer clear of it, and yet see events unfold in their lives that ultimately come to a point where the myth is no longer an ancient story tucked away in books but being played right before their eyes against their will.. Starting from his previous novel,. The Strangeness in My Mind,. , there has been a fundamental shift in Pamuk's style and the subject he deals with. He abandoned the elite and middle classes and their identity problems to tell the stories of Turkey’s - in particular Istanbul’s - underprivileged people, the have-nots. In addition to that he chronicled the changes being wrought in Istanbul as a result of unplanned turbo-ubanisation and the fast disappearance of old arts and crafts in the age of consumerist capitalism and its compulsions.. The Red-Haired Woman. continues in the same vein. It’s about the forgotten people with their now dispensable arts and now obsolete political rivalries, and the fundamental geographical and social changes that were taking place in his beloved Istanbul during the transitory period of the last quarter of the 20th century and, by extension, in Turkey.. In his previous novel he told the story of a family of rural. boza. sellers but in this novel it’s about the old and dying art of manual well-digging. I was particularly interested in that part and found it fascinating, perhaps because I could relate to some of it. I am old enough to remember the dying days of well-digging and functioning wells when I was growing up as a kid back in my village; a few hazy memories of the well that watered vegetables in the backyard of our country house before it had to be closed up and filled with earth when elders decided to install electrical water-pumps to draw up groundwater. That was in Pakistan and this story is from Turkey, but it was pretty much the same in both places. The wells haven't totally disappeared. You can still find them in more remote areas around sparsely populated hamlets where old pastoral and agrarian life continues to this day.. Pamuk spends a lot of pages to describe the finer details of well-digging through the story of one Master Mehmut, the master Well-digger, who takes our main protagonist, Cem, the narrator of two-third of the story, as his apprentice. Things happen that cause Cem to abandon his master and run away and begin a new life in the heart of Istanbul. Then we have a fast-paced narrative that covers decades before the turn of events bring him back to confront his old and buried secret. Cem, fully aware of the guiding myths of his life, tries to maneuver away from them but as fate would have it he’s unable to do so.. The book is designed unevenly and I felt the middle part of the story was rushed, as though the writer didn't want it to go beyond 250 printed pages, or couldn't wait to get to the end of the story to reconnect with the events in the early years of Cem. I also felt that Pamuk tried too hard to interpret the myths for us. He kind of over-explained them to the point that we already knew what's going to happen in the end. That was, in my opinion, a weak spot and a big one. All in all it's a good book but not a great one, despite Pamuk's attempt to give it a solid intellectual foundation by incorporating literary myths.. TRANSLATION AND ITS DISCONTENTS?. I am a fan of Orhan Pamuk but I have to admit that both this one as well as his previous novel,. The Strangeness,. are quite prosaic and conventionally told. The lyrical, intense, and rich style of his older, pre-Nobel novels seems to have disappeared. Some reviewers have suggested it might have to do with the new translator, one Ekin Oklap, after Maureen Freely, the erstwhile translator of his top-rated books, was let go. But I don’t quite think this is the case. You can easily recognise and love Pamuk’s style in. Snow, The Black Book, The Museum of Innocence, The White Castle,. and. My Name is Red.. The first three are translated by Maureen Freely but the last two are translated by Victoria Holbrook and Erdağ Göknar respectively (and Göknar’s one translation happens to be the best of all). This means that what we know of Pamuk’s style and voice isn’t reliant on the translations of Maureen Freely alone.. If three translators between themselves could maintain his style in five books there is no reason why Ekin Oklap would not have been able to do the same. Since I don’t know any Turkish to compare with the originals, I have to deduce from the above that it’s not really Ekin Oklap’s fault but Pamuk’s own style has undergone a change in his recent writings. I’ve argued elsewhere that he might be running out of steam, which isn’t an uncommon phenomenon, even with good writers. You can detect a writer’s literary weariness when you read Marquez’s swansong,. Memories of My Melancholy Whores;. and not surprisingly, being as scrupulous as he was, he didn’t write anything during the last 20 years of his life. It might just be time for Pamuk to sit back and think hard about what he is going to write next or whether he’s going to write anything at all.. October '18","Sep 19, 2018"
3250759,Paul Fulcher,"As a fatherless son, so a sonless father will be embraced by none.. from Ferdowski's Shahnameh (and the epigraph to this novel). I had wanted to be a writer. But after the events I am about to describe, I studied engineer in geology and became a building contractor. Even So, readers shouldn't conclude from my telling the story now that it is over, that I've put it all behind me. The more I remember, the deeper I fall into it. Perhaps you, too, will follow, lured by the enigma of father and sons.. The Red-Haired Woman is the latest novel from Orhan Pamuk, one of those authors of whose books I am a completist, and this, while not perhaps hitting the Nobel-Prize worthy heights of his greatest work Snow, is another excellent addition to his works and my shelves.. [Review updated with some comments from an excellent reading and illustrated discussion between Orhan Pamuk and Boyd Tonkin at London's Southbank in September 2017]. At 250 pages it is much more compact than his last novel, the Dickensian. A Strangeness in My Mind. , but equally enjoyable and worthwhile, the relatively sparse story balanced by an interesting take on father/son relationships rooted in classical epics, but with also links back to Pamuk's earlier works.. And as with A Strangeness in My Mind, the translation by Ekin Oklap who has supplanted Maureen Freely (translator of Museum of Innocence and Snow). Again (my review of the previous book:. https://www.goodreads.com/review/show.... ) the prose does appear more prosaic than Pamuk's earlier works, but whether this is a feature of the original, or indeed truer to Pamuk's prose generally, is difficult for me to say. Pamuk himself, it must be said, commented that he is a big fan of the translation, which is the ultimate endorsement.. The narrator [of most of the novel] begins the story living in Istanbul with his mother, his father, a middle-class pharmacist but also a leftist activist, having, after several periods of prolonged absence both while politically active and while detained by the authorities, finally permanently left the family home and re-married. He is cramming for his university exams, hoping to study literature, and takes on a summer-job in Öngören, a small town 30 miles from Istanbul as an apprentice to a well-digger.. Master Mahmut is one of. the last practitioners of an art that had existed for thousands of years. , although rather dismissive of some of the more elaborate rituals with divining rods and whispered prayers of some of his peers. Cem comments:. These particular skills led some of the old well-diggers to become convinced that, like the shamans of Central Asia, they, too, were in possession of supernatural powers and the gift of extrasensory perception, allowing them to commune with subterranean gods and jinn. I remember as a child hearing my father laugh at such tales, but those longing for cheap ways to find water wanted to believe them ... when well-diggers crouched amongst the creepers and pecking hens in those back gardens, listening to the soil, old men and middle-aged ladies would treat them with the reverence usually reserved for the doctor putting his ear to the sick baby's chest.. The reality of digging wells, as Cem soons discovers, is of back-breaking and dangerous work. Pamuk describes this in almost painful detail, and at first it appears the novel is largely telling the story of a dying craft in the same way as the boza seller in A Strangeness in My Mind. Pamuk himself had been wanting to tell the story of a well-digger looking for water in apparently barren-land ever since he met one while writing his. The Black Book. over 25 years earlier.. But as Master Mahmut and Cem rest in their tent each night from their exertions, the old man tells the apprentice stories, including that of Joseph, favourite son of his father, and abandoned down a well by his brothers. The well-digger draws the moral from the story that. A father must be fair. A father who isn't fair will blind his son.. The next night, particularly tired after striking rock in his digging, Master Mahmut asks Cem to contribute a story of his own. Cem, presumably prompted by the talk of fathers, sons and blindness, tells the well-digger the story of Oedipus. which leads Mahmut to conclude that no one can escape their fate.. In the town, the 16 year-old Cem captures sight of the eponymous red-haired woman, in her thirties but mysterious and alluring. She turns out to be part of a small troupe of performing artists, The Theatre of Morality Tales, and when Cem watches her performance, it concludes with a powerful scene that he later, after researching the story, finds is that of Rostam and Sohrab from the Persian epic poem Shahnameh. In a reversal of the Greek story, here the father Rostam ends up, unknowingly, fighting and killing his son Sohrab.. After the rather drawn out (pun intended) process of digging the well, Cem's time in the town comes to an abrupt end, and the narrative rather accelerates, when he first sleeps with the red-haired woman and then an accident occurs at the well.. He returns to Istanbul where he contemplates both what happens, but also the two tales of Oedipus and of Rostam and Sohrab. In the Oedipal tale he seems particularly fascinating with how he could end up sleeping with his mother (. a woman at least sixteen years older than he was. I tried both couldn't imagine what that was like. ), an odd failure of imagination given that was the exact age-gap to his red-haired lover. And the story of Rostam and Sohrab is one he needs to rediscover. As the islamist Blue explains to the secular modernist Ka in Pamuk's wonderful. Snow. .. Once upon a time, millions of people knew it by heart — from Tabriz to Istanbul, from Bosnia to Trabzon — and when they recalled this story, they found the meaning in their lives. The story spoke to them in just the same way that Oedipus’ murder of his father or Macbeth’s obsession with power and death speak to people throughout the Western world. But now, because we’ve fallen under the spell of the West, we’ve forgotten our own stories.. Pamuk also himself has remarked that the Oedipus and Rostam stories illustrate different aspects of Western and Eastern culture: to the extent our sympathies lie with the murderer in each case, for Oedipus we are supporting individualism and for Rostam authoritarianism and the continuation of the state.. Cem's research takes him around the world to discover manuscripts and miniatures based on the story (one of which features in. My Name is Red. ):. Cem marries and - as the opening quote suggests - inspired by his well-digging experience enters into the construction business, rather than pursue his literary dreams. He and his wife prove unable to have their own children, and instead their construction company, which they name Sohrab, and which grows spectacularly in the rapidly expanding Istanbul, making Cem a rich and well-known businessman, as well as allowing the novel to touch on themes of Westernisation and individualism in the traditional Turkish society:. Sohrab was our son. He was growing up much faster than most children, outperforming his peers, and winning accolades for his business acumen.. Although he never forgets the red-haired woman, even recognising her in the actress. Silvana Mangano who plays Queen Jocasta, Oedipus's mother and wife, in Pier Paolo Pasolini's 1967 film Edipo Re.. During his and his wife's cultural research, they also discovers Wittfogel's. Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power. , which links Asian ""hydraulic societies"", needing conscripted labour to provide water and irrigation, to despotism (a sort of ""at least he made the water run"" equivalent to Mussolini's trains), and thereby, they decide, conditions ripe for patricide or filicide.. As the construction boom and expansion of the city reaches even the tiny town where Cem had helped build the well, he finds himself drawn back to Öngören, and inevitably sucked into a father-son confrontation that will have echoes of the two ancient tales. The coincidences of the stories are perhaps a little unrealistic but as one character remarks:. Theatre has taught me not to dismiss anything in life as mere coincidence. . To say more in the review would spoil the pleasure of the story.. The last section of the novel is narrated by the red-haired woman, reflecting on the events of the novel. She laments, both from the historical tales and her own life, that:. Whether it was fathers killing their sons, or sons killing fathers, men always emerged victorious, and all that was left for me to do was weep.. But as she unravels her own story, we discover a different perspective on what we had seemingly read in the rest of the novel, and realise that she had far more agency that the rather helpless quote above might imply.. And she herself sees a model for her looks in drawings and paintings of the poet and artist's model Elizabeth Siddal by the artist and poet, and later her husband, Dante Gabriel Rossetti in the 1850s, such as this one drawn shortly after their marriage:. The original Turkish version of the novel, for reasons made clear in the text, had such a picture on the front cover - perhaps my one criticism of the English version is that the publisher has chosen a far more abstract cover.. Overall - a wonderful blend of literary commentary, father-son relationships with the added dimension of the mother/wife/lover, and the modernisation of Istanbul.","Aug 21, 2017"

3687216,Yelda Basar Moers,"​I'm a huge fan of the soulful and brilliant Turkish Nobel Prize winning novelist Orhan Pamuk. So when I heard he had a new release (published in the U.S. last month), I got my hands on it as soon as possible.. I loved The Red-Haired Woman, an alluring tale of a teenager who is hired as the apprentice of a master welldigger to find water on a barren plain on the outskirts of Istanbul. During his time on the job, he meets a beautiful red-haired woman. His affair with her transforms him in unimaginable ways. I loved Pamuk's intimate storytelling, his stunning prose filled with poetic, dreamlike musings and old Persian and Greek literature, which he weaves into his narrative. Orhan Pamuk's books are as high quality as modern literature gets-- fine dining on the bookshelf!. This is the fourth book of his that I have read and I'm beginning to see a recurring theme of heartbreak, lost Iove and longing. I wonder if Pamuk had his heart broken in his youth! Some writers have said that if you want to become a novelist-- go out and get your heart broken! Well if this the case for Pamuk, it worked out for him! Heartbreak or no heartbreak, whenever I read a book by him, I always feel like I'm reading a classic, though it is not a classic, as he is still alive!. Below is a snapshot of his stunning prose:. ""The purple peaks toward the Black Sea had assumed a strange blue shade, and the rare clumps of trees among the drab, jaundiced plots in the plains behind the mountains seemed particularly green...it was all beautiful, and a part of me knew that the reason I felt this way was that beautiful red-haired woman I had just seen standing in the doorway of her house.""","Sep 30, 2017"
8904243,Jennifer Blankfein,"Follow my blog Book Nation by Jen. https://booknationbyjen.wordpress.com.... for all reviews and recommendations.. I really enjoyed this short but dense book, The Red-Haired Woman written by Turkish Nobel Prize winning author Orhan Pamuk. In the 1980s, a teenage, fatherless boy is an apprentice to Master Mahmut, a well digger. They dig for water in the hot sun, and tell stories to pass the time. They develop a tight relationship and grow to rely on each other as co-workers and as father and son. One evening the boy observes a beautiful red haired woman twice his age and daydreams about her to get through the difficult days of work. She is an actress in a traveling theater production and he becomes overwhelmed with desire to see her in the play and meet her. Then there is an accident and we don’t know what happens to Mahmut. The boy leaves town and we are not sure who the red-haired woman really is. The characters connections to one another and the mysteries make this novel a fantastic page turner.. Through stories told to the boy by Master Mahmut, ideas about fathers and sons are explored with references to Oedipus Rex, where a son kills his father and has children with his mother, and Rostam and Sohrab, where the father kills his son. I had to do some googling to fully understand the references, but I like to learn something when I read and this story was captivating. Love, loss and relationships are touched upon in The Red-Haired Woman, giving the reader a lot to think about, and so well written with a few shockers and surprises. I loved how myths and real life paralleled each other and I highly recommend this book!","Nov 06, 2017"
900147,Laura,"From BBC Radio 4 - Book at Bedtime:. The Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk explores the complex layers of father-son relationships through the apparently simple story of a young man apprenticed to a welldigger on the outskirts of Istanbul.. As the story of the well digging proceeds, he brings together eastern and western myths and legends to look at what is really meant by authority and rebellion. Can anyone ever escape their fate?. With this vivid image of digging towards the centre of the earth at the heart of the story, he brings together eastern and western myths and legends to look at what is really meant by authority and rebellion. Can anyone ever escape their fate?. Cem Çelik is a ""little gentleman"", the son of a leftist Istanbul pharmacist whose politics take precedence over parenthood. During one of his father's lengthy and regular disappearances, 16 year-old Cem gives up his holiday job guarding his uncle's orchard and apprentices himself to a master well-digger, Mahmut. They set about digging a well to provide water for a local businessman's factory.. Heraclitus said that truth lies at the bottom of a well. The wells of Pamuk's Turkey are something quite sinister - here, guilt and shame lurk in the darkness, forever threatening to come spewing up into the light. The novel turns on Cem's encounter with the red-haired woman of the title and a subsequent act by the well that stains the rest of his life.. As Cem accepts the warm but irascible Mahmut as a surrogate father, and Mahmut slowly begins to regard Cem with a fatherly affection, the storytelling begins. First Cem listens intently to Mahmut's tales, then is himself invited to speak. Myth and folklore pervade the novel, and throw the events of Cem's life into sharp focus, against the backdrop of the ever expanding 21st century Istanbul.. Written by Orhan Pamuk.

10360290,Mostafa Mostafa,"No wonder i am a Pamuk fan!. This book was quite different, style wise and plot, from his previous works!. Pamuk illustrates in his book the unsettling relationship between father and son!. Growing up fatherless, Cem becomes a well digger’s apprentice who takes the role as his father!. The book is divided into three parts; two of which narrated by Cem himself at 16 and 30s and the third by the red haird woman!. Cem’s character development can be sensed and is felt in the first two parts; the voice is more mature!. The two parts are tied elegantly together by the red woman herself lending us her voice in the third part!. How myths and fables shape your lives and even change their course is pretty interesting!. Over the course of the book, Pamuk discusses fatherhood and its role and impact in a son’s life!. Istanbul as usual is a character in this book; although acquiring a minor role ( compared to his other works), it develops and grows!. The book wraps up in a major dramatic conclusion which, although you can predict, but leaves you in awe!. Pamuk had done a great job! Highly recommended!","Aug 17, 2018"
1802440,Cynthia,"For the first third of Re-Haired Woman it barely held my interest. Fortunately Pamuk has such a stellar reputation that I forced myself to keep reading. The story begins on a sleepy mountaintop in a town outside Istanbul, Turkey where a well digger and his two teenage charges tell one another morality stories and occasionally wander down the mountain and into the small town. Ongoren boasts a military outpost some restaurants and coffee houses and a band of actors who are there for a limited run. Coincidentally they act out ancient Turkish legends. The red-haired woman and her husband are part of this troupe and she catches the eye of Cem. He becomes obsessed and seeks her out whenever he can.. Part of the reason I didn't enjoy the beginning was because the well digger, Master Mahmut, is so heavy handed in his supremacy over the boys. They're expected to obey him and listen to his long winded stories without question. The next part of the book where Cem is an adult and able to see things more clearly and determine his own destiny is much more enjoyable. It goes without saying that this Nobel Laureate writes beautifully and the significance of the legends becomes clearer as you read on..

Here are a couple of lines to prove my point: 'I let out each piercing wail, hoping for some release from the anguish' and 'The things you hear in old myths and folktales always end up happening in real life.' Not usually, actually. Avoid at all costs. I would rather barbecue my own eyeballs than read another of his books.","Oct 02, 2017"

45597216,Yuko Shimizu,"My favorite film director is Wong Ka-Wai. I often say if Pamuk or. Haruki Murakami. were to be made into films, they have to be directed by Wong. Not that their books are similar, but all the emotions, sadness and melancholy of the characters, often depicted in minute but memorable scenes (rather than going on and on about actual emotions)... All three of them do this the best.. Now to think about it, Murakami is known for often using a well as symbolism. And This book is also about a well. (. My Name is Red. too of course.) Then while I was reading this, I came to a realization that. Kafka on the Shore. is also a modern retelling of Oedipus myth. Why did it take me so long to realize this? But, anyways, really interesting comparison/companion book. Same myth, completely different stories, equally captivating.. I couldn't put it down, and read the whole thing over a weekend. Considering English is my second language (I still read much faster in Japanese), it's a record.. So many thoughts and emotions. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time.","Aug 24, 2017"

51872363,Miriam Cihodariu,"This story explored the complicated and difficult relations between fathers and sons, with multiple layers. I like the author's fascination with Western (Oedipus) and Eastern (Rustem) myths regarding colossally tragic stories of patricide or filicide, and how these stories reverberate and foreshadow the events in the book.. You can read in the book many things between the lines, from toxic masculinity (the fragility the Red Haired Woman is talking about) to tensions between conservatize and modernizing forces in Turkey, some allusions to state & police brutality and so on.. The folk tales taken from Persian myths are very endearing and make me think of the Romanian versions of them I used to read or listen to as I grew up. Yes, they reached even here, probably when they were still popular in Turkey too.. I also liked the very vivid descriptions of everything. The landscapes are pulsating, and there never seems to be a dull moment in these descriptions- or something which drags along too much.. --------------------------------------------------. Some of my favorite excerpts:. “Sometimes I pictured us reading a book together, before at last kissing and making love. According to my father, the greatest happiness in life was to marry the girl you’d spent your youth reading books with in the passionate pursuit of a shared ideal. I’d heard him tell my mother as much while describing someone else’s happiness.”. “In those moments, I thought: I am most completely myself when nobody’s watching. I had only just begun to discover this truth. When there is no one to observe us, the other self we keep hidden inside can come out and do as it pleases. But when you have a father near enough to keep an eye on you, that second self remains buried within.”. “My father left us!” I said.. “Then he wasn’t a father at all,” she said. “Find yourself a new father. We all have many fathers in this country. The fatherland, Allah, the army, the Mafia…No one here should ever be fatherless.”. The Red-Haired Woman now seemed to me clever as well as beautiful.. And one from the perspective of the red-haired woman herself:. “I wasn’t yet thirty-five, and already I’d discovered how proud and fragile men could be, the sense of self that courses through their veins. I knew that fathers and sons were capable of killing each other. Whether it was fathers killing their sons, or sons killing the fathers, men always emerged victorious, and all that was left for me to do was weep.”","May 10, 2019"

Love Pamuk's style of writing cause his plot will always tell me a descriptive views of the character's life be it an important character or not. The slice of life plot, the enthralling collection of stories Cem knows by heart-- Oedipus, Rostam and Sohrab, and other epic tales. Thrilling, surprising and wonder at every turn. A retribution and revenge, perhaps an epic mythology turns to reality. I love the smoothness of the plot although the descriptiveness sometimes making me worn out a little. The actuality of each scenes were emotionally presented and vivid. As much as I got to know each of the character I realised on how I actually dislike the red-haired woman-- something about her personality did not fascinates me as much as Cem did.. It speaks centuries of Istanbul as a whole-- its development, social and political. Very nostalgic. Apart from the historical feeling that I really love, it interests me a lot on how the narrative keeps wandering around with father-son relationship as its subject. It shows some sight of one's humanity, unexpected feelings and sincere thought. A great read nevertheless.","Mar 14, 2019"

On the outskirts of a town thirty miles from Istanbul, a master well-digger and his young apprentice are hired to find water on a barren plain. As they struggle in the summer heat, excavating without luck metre by metre, the two will develop a filial bond neither has known before--not the poor middle-aged bachelor nor the middle-class boy whose father disappeared after being arrested for politically subversive activities. The pair will come to depend on each other, and exchange stories reflecting disparate views of the world. But in the nearby town, where they buy provisions and take their evening break, the boy will find an irresistible diversion. The Red-Haired Woman, an alluring member of a travelling theatre company, catches his eye and seems as fascinated by him as he is by her. The young man's wildest dream will be realized, but, when in his distraction a horrible accident befalls the well-digger, the boy will flee, returning to Istanbul. Only years later will he discover whether he was in fact responsible for his master's death and who the red-headed enchantress was.. Recollections of an absent father. The countryside beyond Istanbul, 1986. The well-diggers visit a nearby town.. Used to listening to the master's stories, Cem is asked to speak. A visit to a travelling theatre opens up a new world to the young apprentice.. A night with the red-headed woman excites a tired young well-digger. Fearing the worst, Cem flees Istanbul and goes home to Gebze. Cem is a success, but he is drawn to storytelling, folklore and myth.. At his farther's funeral, Cem is approached by a stranger. The red-haired woman remembers a night at the theatre thirty years ago. as the red-haired woman's son grows, he begins to ask questions about his father.. BBC description:. The Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk explores the complex layers of father-son relationships through the apparently simple story of a young man apprenticed to a welldigger on the outskirts of Istanbul.. With this vivid image of digging towards the centre of the earth at the heart of the story, he brings together eastern and western myths and legends to look at what is really meant by authority and rebellion. Can anyone ever escape their fate?. Cem Çelik is a ""little gentleman"", the son of a leftist Istanbul pharmacist whose politics take precedence over parenthood. During one of his father's lengthy and regular disappearances, 16 year-old Cem gives up his holiday job guarding his uncle's orchard and apprentices himself to a master well-digger, Mahmut. They set about digging a well to provide water for a local businessman's factory.. Heraclitus said that truth lies at the bottom of a well. The wells of Pamuk's Turkey are something quite sinister - here, guilt and shame lurk in the darkness, forever threatening to come spewing up into the light. The novel turns on Cem's encounter with the red-haired woman of the title and a subsequent act by the well that stains the rest of his life.. As Cem accepts the warm but irascible Mahmut as a surrogate father, and Mahmut slowly begins to regard Cem with a fatherly affection, the storytelling begins. First Cem listens intently to Mahmut's tales, then is himself invited to speak. Myth and folklore pervade the novel, and throw the events of Cem's life into sharp focus, against the backdrop of the ever expanding 21st century Istanbul..

35482263,Gumble's Yard,"For an insightful review of this book including: the themes underlying it; its connection to classical literature (including but not restricted to the legends of Oedipus and of Rostam and Sohrab); its links to Pamuk’s existing canon – a canon which deservedly won him the Nobel prize; the way in which Pamuk as ever explores the fissures in Turkish society; a hint as to the twists in the latter part of this book, I can only recommend Paul’s review here. https://www.goodreads.com/review/show.... However I don’t agree with the overall assessment of the book – and my 3* rating is more of a 2.5 rounded up for one of my favourite authors writing (as he often does) about one of my favourite cities (Istanbul).. The reason for my hesitation is that, at least in the first 2/3rd or so of the book, Pamuk makes sure he explains every classical allusion or metaphor, every link between the story of the narrator and the stories of legend at such length (not just when they happen, but before they happen so that we can guess what is coming, and them after it has happened just in case we have not been paying attention) that no space is left for the reader’s own interpretation, imagination or research.. Now such an approach could work if performed consciously and explicitly and with a narrator who repeatedly breaks out of the narrative and/or breaks through the third wall to address the reader directly; however this book is at least for most of its length written as a very traditional novel with a first person narrator who is the protagonist of the action.","Nov 12, 2017"

5927877,Kyriakos Sorokkou,"Δείτε την κριτική στα Ελληνικά στις. βιβλιοαλχημείες. I read my first Pamuk in the spring of 2015. The book was. My Name Is Red. .. It was one of the first books I read after I decided to read more diversely, and internationally.. I bought it because I hadn't read a book from Turkey before, and the plot was intriguing. The narrator of the first chapter is a corpse. In one of the following chapters the colour Red itself is the narrator.. Many said that this is an Islamic version of Umberto Eco's. The Name of the Rose. .. Well, not exactly; but both books have some connections with each other.. There's the colour red in their title, there's a blind wise man in a labyrinthine library, there's also a murder investigation, and both books discuss tradition over progress.. After finishing it I realised that Pamuk will be the author from whom I'll buy whatever he writes.. The blurb on the back cover says that. ""Pamuk is a exceptional novelist, who keeps writing his best novels after his Nobel Prize win."". Indeed he is one of the few authors that won a prestigious prize that I enjoy. His books are not for the elite, the academics and their elitist thralls.. Everyone can read them, both those who enjoy. Paulo Coelho. and those who enjoy. Machado de Assis. Of course as always I'm prattling about. anything. else besides this book.. Let me return back to this book.. Since my first Pamuk in 2015, I read at least on book by him each year, six in total.. This book came into fruition after an incident that happened to Pamuk.. A well-digger and his teenage apprentice. He saw in them a father son relation.. So he decided to write a story based on this incident and with themes on patricide and infanticide.. They both serve as themes in two great classic works of Western and Eastern civilisation:. Oedipus Rex. and. Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings. .. And of course a mysterious red-haired woman that acts as the (missing) link in all of this.. As with his previous books we have in this book once more, a dialogue between East and West, religion and secularism, tradition and change.. Not my best Pamuk but I can't be 100% objective with an author I love to read from, and even watch and enjoy his interviews, that always have this storytelling feel.. Now I have to think what will be my next and 7th Pamuk.","May 19, 2020"

Nietzsche on the myth of Oedipus, Sophocles’s play Oedipus Rex, then one from Shahnameh which a kind of mirror of Oedipus Rex in which a father kills his son. Not surprising then that this short book (short for Pamuk) is about father-son relationships. It's also about modern Turkey's battle between Westernisation and tradition. Its a cleverly told story.. The first Part is a simple tale of a young 16 year old who spends a month digging a well with a master well-digger. The two swap stories and the boy sees the well-digger as a father figure. At nights the boy goes to the local town and is goo-goo about an older woman with red-hair.. Part 2 sees the boy become a man, gets married and runs a successful property development business. He returns to the place where he dug the well and..... Part 3 is narrated by the red-haired woman who ties the story up nicely.","Jul 19, 2020"
38383557,Victor,"In case you were wondering what this book is about, I'll tell you: it's about the story of Oedip and the story of Rostan and Shorab. I discovered that by reading the careful placed clues around the novel, amounting to 200, about one for each page.. Besides that it's not much: your Turkish variety of a soap opera that wants to take itself serious by employing a fairy tale tone of sorts that falls flat and a recount of the explosive growth of a city (I'll let you take a wild guess) that comes close to being fetishized.. If you'd strip away the affectation you'd be left with nothing but a description of a worrisome society caught in a battle between Islamic and Occidental values and losing it in favor of Islam and maybe behind this last bastion hides the true meaning of the story. There are plenty clues to support this interpretation and if you consider the Red Haired Woman as the embodiment of Turkey the painting gains shape.","Sep 28, 2017"

I really shouldn't expect any sort of thriller or anything like that but somehow, retrospectively, I think that's what I did.. The language wasn't hard to read so I think that's kudos to the translator. The beginning (about 1/3) was interesting enough but then it just went down and down. The protagonist got to be obsessed over a couple of ancient texts (of which I'm familiar with one that I had to do at school and hated it) with similar incidents at the end though with opposite endings so it made the ending of this book rather predictable.

10283403,Dick Reynolds,"The protagonist of this story is a man named Cem. As a young man he finds work helping a well-digger named Mahmut. Their activity is told in fairly graphic detail; Mahmut wields the pick and shovel while Cem stays outside the well working a device that lowers and raises a bucket into and out of the well.. Cem finds time to become friends with a red-headed woman named Gulcihan who is an actress appearing in a traveling theater group performing near the site of the well dig. Cem has a brief romantic episode with Gulcihan but their relationship doesn’t go anywhere because of their age difference.. One day Cem becomes careless with the bucket; it falls into the well striking Mahmut. Cem doesn’t hear any response from Mahmut and abruptly leaves the site without trying to get help for Mahmut. At this point I would have strangled Cem if he was anywhere near me. Suffice it to say that he is tormented by guilt for a long time.. But time goes on. Back at his home town, Cem meets a woman named Ayse, they fall in love and get married. They want children but it’s not to be because Ayse is not able to have them. At this point in the book I had an “aha” moment and knew where the plot was heading.. Cem and Ayse become partners in a construction business and it’s very profitable. Many years later Cem is on a business trip that takes him to the area where he and Mr. Mahmut had worked on digging that well. Cem learns about what happened to Mr. Mahmut and meets several other important people from his distant past. In such a manner, the several plot lines of the book are neatly resolved.. Author Orhan Pamuk writes a beautiful but sometimes uneven story and the translation from the original Turkish is English is particularly good. There is considerable philosophizing about father and son relationships, such as Rostam and Sohrab. There are also references to Oedipus, a subject that held little interest for me, and only slowed down the main line of the plot.","Feb 14, 2018"

And when a kind stranger gifted me this book as a sign of good wishes and luck, I was immediately hooked onto it. It was a slow read at first but the curiousity about knowing who The Red-Haired Woman is kept me going. I wouldn't say it's a perfect read but it was definitely worth reading because it made me think about the concept of fate and destiny and about the infinite loop of repeating stories/moments. And Pamuk's writing is pretty simple. Small, simple sentences that convey the meaning of the story directly instead of using puns and jargon(even though it can said that the whole story is a metaphor in itself) The myth infused with the tale made The Red Haired Woman a modern fable that is almost real. The tone of the story is melancholic(for me) but shaped the character of Cem and the entire story. More importantly, the story gave me an insight into the world of Turkey and this is my first Turkish novel. I just complete reading it and let's say I am still letting it sync in. Read it if you can.

33440429,Ashish,"Somewhere Between 3.5 and 4 for this one. The book is a heady mix of fables, of relationships, of time, of the people in a country going through a tumultuous evolution, and of politics. The base of the book rests on the father-son relationship and it borrows extensively from myths and stories that have a foundation in it; the story of Oedipus, of Rustom and Shorab, both of which based in the dichotomy of the father and the son and the paths that they take, resulting in their clash. With overt references to patricide and filicide, the reader is made to see the various analogies and how they work towards the climax, the exact nature of which one isn't made clear until the very end. However in an attempt to fit the story into one of the two moulds, the author makes use of a couple of Deus Ex Machina, which might seem alright in a fable, but weakens the second half of the book.. The first half of the book is brilliant as it establishes the protagonist and his place in the world around him. With a father who is gone when the he was just a boy, the reader sees a longing in him to have a strong father figure. It is one of the strongest themes that runs through the book. There are parts of the book which talk about the need for a father figure, the need for one who watches over the kid and sees that he develops into a strong individual, and this is allegorical of the political changes in Turkey over the years, the rise of oppressive and strong powers looking over the country. There are a lot of references to the socio-political circumstances in the country as we see the story weave it's way over the decades to modern day turkey.. The writing in the book is good, nothing exceptional. It shines in parts where the protagonist wonders about the nature of stars and our place in the world around us, his youthful infatuation with the red-haired woman which changes the course of his life, and the repercussions that haunt him his whole life till the end.. There are obvious pacing issues with the book in the second half, a few convenient coincidences and an attempt to sort of shoe-horn it into a fable-like mould. However it's worth a read, especially for its beautiful references to lore and the honest depiction of a country which connects the east to the west, as does the book which does the same for myths.","Nov 13, 2017"
7177008,Jane,"Set in Turkey over a period of 30 years or so starting around 1986. In order to make a little money, Cem, the main character, a teenager close to finishing high school, serves as an apprentice to a well-digger, Master Mahmut, in a small town near Istanbul. The Master sometimes tells old myths and tales when their work for the day is finished. In the nearby small town, the boy meets a red-haired woman. She turns out to be an actress in a traveling troupe of players who re-enact comic skits and versions of classic tales. Cem is infatuated with her and has a one-night stand with her. After an accident to his boss which Cem causes, Cem thinks he has killed him and flees the town. Years pass and Cem marries but he and his wife are unable to have children. They are obsessed with the stories of Oedipus [a patricide] and of Rustam and Sohrab [a filicide from a Persian epic] and travel all over the world to see manuscripts and paintings of these stories. Cem, now a geological engineer, founds a construction company, Sohrab [it becomes his ""son"", so to speak], and becomes very wealthy. Decades later Cem visits the area where he had apprenticed years before. It has changed remarkably. Where is the well? Did he really kill Master Mahmut? Who is the young man, Enver, and is there any connection to Cem if any?. Very readable, good translation, and the mystery aspect gripped me all through. I was disappointed in Pamuk's last few books, but this one made up for them. The novel emphasized the differing relations between fathers and son: filial and paternal love or lack thereof.","Mar 25, 2019"
11701608,Barbara,"Personally, I think this novel should have been entitled “Life follows Myth” which is truly the main theme of this novel. Turkish author, Orhan Pamuk has chosen to write in depth how he feels the father/son relationship, or more importantly conflict, either resembles the ancient myth of Sophocles’ “Oedipus Rex” or Ferdowsi’s “Shahnameh”. In the former myth the son unknowingly kills his father; in the later myth the father unknowingly kills his son.. The main character is Cem whose father is missing in his life. As a teen, Cem searches for a father figure and finds one in his first employer, a well digger. At age sixteen Cem is an apprentice for a well digger for a month. Their relationship is close and philosophical. While working there is a traveling theater troupe, which features a beguiling red-haired woman. She is his first crush and Cem becomes obsessed with the red-haired woman, well into his adult years. Cem’s apprenticeship ends abruptly after an accident and that one month becomes an influential event in his life. The red-haired woman and the well digger are ghosts that shape Cem’s future.. All son/father relationships are seen as resembling parables that Cem has read. Cem’s hobby is researching parables and myths, notable the aforementioned ones. Maybe this novel was too cerebral from me, but I found it redundant and a bit boring. I finished it because when I wanted to quit, I was almost done. And then, at the end, it got better.. Do I recommend it? No. Was it worth reading? Yes. I did enjoy the pieces of Turkish history that was woven in the story. Cem is a young teenager in the 1980’s, and all through the novel, Pamuk weaves political Turkish history. I’d recommend it to those who enjoy reflecting upon traditional and historical events that resemble myths and parables.","Sep 30, 2017"

A retelling of father and son dynamic as captured by the mythologies, as in the Oedipus in the West or Rostam-Sohrab in the East, in the context of modern Turkey (Istanbul). The interweaving of reality and myth is quite interesting, in which myth can be a self fulfilling prophecy, no matter what you do it can always happen. I always like the Pamuk uses first-person narrators to capture the multiple sides of the story. It is a relatively ""easy"" read compared to his previous books, a little less layered and partly relies on convenient coincidences, which is probably because this book is written in a year, a relatively short time for him.","May 25, 2017"
29609809,Kunjila Mascillamani,"Deep bought this book and tried to show off by finishing it in three days or something. He asked me to read it because he wanted to discuss something about it with me, he said. So i read the book in three months. I liked it but did not like it also. Obsession with fathers and fatherhood is something i don't get. It's really not a thing for me. But the narrative technique used by Pamuk is something to take note of. That was what Deep wanted to talk about as well.. The first part is a first person narrative of a boy who has a father who abandoned him. But he is writing it after he grew up. He is looking back at the incidents, narrating a story from his past. It is about his relationship with Master Mahmut, the well digger, when he was a child. The simple manner in which their relationship is portrayed as growing is subtle and lovely.. Once, a shooting star traversed a sliver of sky still visible between the cypresses, and we both turned to each other at the same time, as if to say, Did you see that?. ***. We gazed at the stars while walking up our hill and didn't talk at all. It was as if a crime had been committed, and since the countless stars and crickets around s had all witnessed it, we lowered our gaze ad kept quiet. The cemetery owl greeted us from the black cypress.. However, it was not possible for me to dissolve in the relationship or relate to it much because frankly, i have no idea what fathers are like and what they do when they are with their children. But there is one part that i understood in it. It was the part in which the boy was getting jealous of Master Mahmut and also angry with him.This was possible for me because i have been there in my relationship with her. And when i see others get angry with her and jealous of her, i quickly understand what they are thinking.. What was behind this talk of blindness? How had the topic even come up? Was it to emphasize how dark it had been inside the well where Joseph was confined? I have asked myself this question countless times over the years. Why did that story upset me so much and make me so angry at Master Mahmut?. ***. . . . Clearly some of these things had been tossed into dried-out wells for safekeeping, only to be forgotten as years and then centuries passed. Wasn't that strange? If you cared about something, something valuable, but then left it inside a well and forgot about it, what did it mean?. The way he felt he should hide his encounter with the Red - Haired Woman. . . . I felt I had to protect this blissful thing within me from his anger. . .. Now here is an honest depiction of how men view sex as a means of establishing power. . . . sleeping with someone like the Red - Haired Woman had lifted my self-confidence to the point that I felt there was nothing I couldn't do. . .. And the explanations they weave in their mind to justify their patriarchy before hitting on a woman. Or trying to sleep with a woman. This one is to justify that it was okay that he had slept with the wife of a man he knew or was an acquaintance of.. It wasn't as if Turgay was my long time friend, anyway - I'd only met him three or four times, I reasoned. Besides, these rootless theater migrants who danced so suggestively and told vulgar tales to entertain soldiers did not exactly subscribe to wholesome family values. Who knows, maybe Turgay himself cheated on his wife with other women. Maybe they entertained each other with tales from their extramarital adventures. Maybe tomorrow the Red - Haired Woman would tell Turgay about her night with me. Maybe she wouldn't even do that and forget all about me instead.. And yeah, i discovered that someone else noticed points of view in dreams and had similar experiences like mine. . . . Sometimes in my dreams there was a third eye, and I would simultaneously watch Master Mahmut and observe my younger self watching him.. Description of the experience of digging inside the well:. . . . As long as I could see Master up there, I didn't feel alone underground. Every time he moved aside to empty the bucket, a small disk of sky was revealed. How perfectly blue it was! It was remote, like the world at the wrong end of a telescope, but it was beautiful. Until Master Mahmut reappeared, I stood immobile, staring up at the sky at the end of that concrete telescope.. Part II is narrated by the same person but is his life after he abandoned Master Mahmut in the well and fled for his home, like a criminal. His thoughts about what he had done and how he felt about it and the ways in which he tried to justify it.. . . . I was sure that he was still doggedly digging, like a persistent fruitworm burrowing its way through a gargantuan orange.. ***. Some nights I saw Master Mahmut in my dreams. He was still digging away, somewhere up in space on a colossal bluish sphere spinning slowly among the stars. That must mean he wasn't dead and that I need not feel so guilty. But it still hurt if I looked too closely at the planet he stood on.. ***. And I still thought of Master Mahmut: somewhere in the back of my mind, an ever-shrinking man was digging a well right through the core of the earth, and sometimes he entered my dreams in other guises and told me stories.. Chaper 31 has the names of some films you can watch after reading this book.. Part III is titled The Red - Haired Woman and is told from the point of view of the Red - Haired Woman. Here is where it becomes complicated.. She narrates the story of her love relationship with Cem's father. There is a portion i liked for the similarity it bears with the Communists in Mallu Land (Kerala).. I used to discuss these matters with Akin, my son's future grandfather, back in my tenties when we were in love. He was always astonished to recall all the profanities boys learned in school and militar'y service, swear words I'd never even heard of when he mentioned them, commenting how ""disgusting"" they were and launching into a tirade on the ""oppression of women,"" which he always ended with his assurances that no such obscenities would survive the establishment of a working-class utopia. I had only to be patient and stand behind our men while they prepared the revolution. . .. Now the Red - Haired Woman asks her son who is now in jail for having killed his father, Cem, to write the story that we just read. She believes that if it is written in a certain way, the judge will forgive him and give a favourable verdict. Here it reminded me of 'If On a Winter's Night a Traveller' by Italo Calvino. The writer is asking the read to choose and judge the characters. The last part took it father than required, in my opinion. The author - Orhan Pamuk - started making the characters speak his mind when he adopted the narrative technique.. . . . ""I'm so happy to hear you're going to write your novel now, my darling boy!"" I said. ""You can put this picture on the cover when it is finished, and perhaps there may even be some room in there for you to write about your beautiful mother when she was young. See, this woman looks a bit like me. Of course you know best how your novel should start, but I think it ought to be sincere and mythical at the same time, like the monologues I used to delover at the end of our performances. It should be as credible as a true story, and as familiar as a myth. That way, everyone, not just the judge, will understand what you are trying to say. Remember: your father had always wanted to be a writer, too."". In the end when the Red - Haired Woman is suggesting the boy how to write the book, we also start to think if it wasn't her who wrote the whole thing to save her son or to tell this story. But since we also know that it was Pamuk who wrote all of it, we wonder why he did that. Why did he begin as if the story was being told by Cem, the man who gets killed by the end of the novel. It's not clear but is interesting. Otherwise, it is not a great read but is a good one. I lost interest when i learned that the revelation in the end was that the woman had slept with both the father and the son. It sounded like a male fantasy to me right there.","Jan 11, 2018"
11514706,Rima,"With Orhan Pamuk, you got to learn the art of patience, the art of savoring every single word, page and chapter till you reach approximately half the novel not knowing where you are heading. It is not because of mystery or intrigue that you feel like you are wandering aimlessly in his pages; it is just description (with a complete absence of action) that smoothly and psychologically prepares you for what is coming. Then, after you start threatening and swearing that you are going to write the worst review for the book(along with feeling betrayed by one of your favorite authors), action happens. Afterwards, the writer skillfully weaves between the ancient and the modern, between mythology and modern art to produce an unprecedented plot about relationships between son, father and mother. Pamuk takes you forth and back in time to Greece, Iran, Istanbul and so many other European countries. You enjoy the ride so much to an extent that you don’t want to land. When you reach the final page, you turn the following blank pages in disbelief looking for a word, a line or if you are lucky a page from him. It is simply an amazing read!","Dec 26, 2017"
4917378,Daniel,"This is such an excellent novel. Having read a number of Pamuk's other works, this one stands out for its concision and poignancy. As many other reviews have already noted, the novel plays with the myths of Oedipus and Sohrab: the western Oedipus unknowingly kills his father and marries his mother, the eastern Sohrab is killed by his father Rostam. As in all his other novels, Pamuk flirts with the Turkish struggle to situate itself between the east and the west, the traditional and the modern, the secular and the religious. This struggle is reflected in Cem's western, secular, and modern identity, and his son Enver's religious and, perhaps, more eastern identity.","Sep 05, 2017"
4922926,Elise,"I love Orhan Pamuk's novels, but I don't love them all equally. This one held me captive just like the red-haired woman held Cem, the story's protagonist, under her spell. Here Pamuk tells a modern story of love, lust, and infidelity that resonates with ancient myth and legend. He also does a fine job of creating tension and discomfort that drives the plot in ways that made it difficult to put this book down. While reading The Red-Haired Woman, I was transported to an alien and enchanting world, one that is dark, and strange, but also familiar in the way that it reached me at a deep human level. Thank you, Orhan Pamuk, for another great story!","Dec 04, 2017"
25281221,Kevin Luy,"Think it's slow going...KEEP READING.. Usually I hate when people say that, but it's true. The last Part pulls everything together in really interesting ways.. As in my favorite Pamuk, he has fun with the narrative voice using different perspective a to tell his story.. Only drawback is the east/west father/son narratives get to be a little much. We get, Orhan, you're telling a story about contentious generations.","Sep 20, 2017"
38648548,Megan S,"This started off so promisingly...I enjoyed the passages about well-digging and found I was more intrigued than I would have imagined. However, after not too long, this book went downhill. I found the plot and writing incredibly unsubtle - the links to the myths are constantly hammered home. And I found the characters and their arcs unbelievable. In particular, I thought the red-haired woman of the title to be a complete fantasy figure. Lots of eye rolling from me.","Feb 17, 2018"

38723674,Nomentions,"All the classic features of Pamuk, weaving in western and eastern myth, secular and religion, and rapacious and corrupt development of the land.

105474709,DIEGO KEVIN,"*This comment has been written by a Spanish speaker. If you see something wrong with its content, please, don´t hesitate in comment it. Thanks*. *This comment may contain spoilers*. The red-haired woman is a novel written by the awarded Orham Pamuk. It narrates us the story of Cem Celik, who is a teenager with an absent father and dreams of being a writer. Unfortunately for him, he needs money for enter in a university. However, un day he meets Mahmut Usta -a person who makes wells for extract water-, who takes him as his apprentice. Together, they´re going to work for almost a month, but without success. A deep relationship grows between them, even Cem will come to consider Mahmut as if he were his father. In the city nearby where they work, Cem will see a red hair woman and he fall in love with her. That added to the zero success in the excavation, forces Cem to leave Mahmut when he needed him most. As Cem grows and get older, always feel guilty about this and will never forget Mahmut.. The novel talk about the same themes developed in the Greek tragedy Oedipus and the Iranian legend The Sad Battle. It´s very interesting how the author tries to retold these same stories on a modern context, it´s very predictable, though. In my opinion, there´re too much emphasis in Oedipus and The Sad Battle and this is so much that at some point we already know that either Cem will murder his son or his son will murder him. We don´t expect other final and -even when the narrative technique is really good- what we think happens.. About this technique in the narrative of the novel I want to say an appreciation. In the last chapter of the novel, we discover that who narrates the story is the son of Cem. The mother of this child is the red hair woman and who narrates the sexual encounter is the son of Cem. That hasn´t nothing weird but gets strange when we think about the relationship existents between him and his mother. He kisses her mother´s hand as if he were her lover and when Cem is going to enter in the house of the Red Hair Women she tells him that she could be his mother. Why did this get my attention? Because incest was the only detail missing in this modern Oedipous. The scene of the sexual encounter is not developed in the novel, so that could make us think different than my theory. But it also is mentioned how people reacted on front of this theme: the Red Hair Woman tells that when she tried to talk about this in her plays, the audience attacked her and she needed to stop her performance due to people didn´t use to talk or think about this, they didn´t even imagine something like that. But Erven could think of his mother in that particular situation and I know that he didn´t narrate an incestuous encounter, but maybe that idea crossed his mind at some point or if didn´t, why else would he put that phrase in his mother´s mouth? “I could be your mother”.. In conclusion, I do not agree with the criticism of this novel that says that is too superficial or that it is lost in its symbols. I do think that is overloaded of symbols and some of these are explained in excess, but I also think that the critics are losing some of the others. When something has all the lighting for itself, it doesn´t allow to see other important things. Maybe this was the author´s intention with the lighting, we are talking about a Nobel winner, we shouldn´t forget that.","Nov 15, 2019"
5693583,James (JD) Dittes,"This is an astonishing book: astonishing for its ambition (Pamuk is paralleling both the Greek playwright, Sophocles, and the Persian bard, Fedowsi), its relevance to today, and its depth. I have loved Pamuk since reading. My Name is Red. , but I never thought he would again publish something as insightful as. Snow,. which I consider to be his masterpiece.. Step aside. Snow. , I'm here to say that. The Red-Haired Woman. is every bit as significant a book for western readers, as well as for Turks.. Snow. (2002) was a novel set in the hinterlands at a time when Islamism was resurgent in rural Turkey. A secular writer journeys to Van to investigate suicides by girls wishing to wear headscarves, rekindling a long-lost romance in the process. The book explained to readers like me the passions of Islamists, while examining the issues from the POV of a westernized Turk. It was an amazing story and an astonishing piece of cross-cultural translation on the eve of the Iraq War.. Picking up 15 years later,. The Red-Headed Woman. isn't set in the hinterlands, but in a suburb of Istanbul in a Turkey where Islamists are dominant and President Recep Erdogan is in the process of overturning the secular republic established by Kemal Ataturk 100 years ago. The two books are complimentary, but TRHW is far more ambitious.. So many of Pamuk's novels revolve around obsession and unrequited love. Here, the 16-year-old Cem, abandoned by his father and forced to save money for college as an apprentice to a well-digger, falls hard for the title character, whose name is given several times in the book but who remains The Red-Haired Woman to the end. When he isn't busy with the tiring work of hand-digging a well 30 meters into the earth, Cem mopes around the village of Öngören, hoping to catch a glimpse of the woman.. After spending the night with TRHW, Cem makes a mistake on the work site the next day and flees the town, thinking that he has killed the kindly master well-digger who has become like a father to Cem. At this point in the plot, one might think that Pamuk has Dickens on his mind: a teenage boy has fallen on hard times but flees the scene of the crime with great expectations in store.. Ha. Pamuk has far greater lights in mind.. Two stories enter the narrative as Cem grows into adulthood: Oedipus Rex, which originates in Greece, the culture to Turkey's west, and the. Shahnameh,. the epic saga of the kings of Persia, the culture to Turkey's east. Both stories deal with abandoned sons; both stories end in tragic murders.. Pamuk is the perfect writer to illustrate the tensions that pull Turkey eastward as well as westward. For western readers like me, he balances secular sensibilities with a deep love for his homeland. He is an illustrator of culture every bit as precise as those featured in the Topkapi Palace.The novel's close ties to these timeless classics do not spoil a thrilling, surprising ending.. The novel reaches back into the Marxist revolutionaries of the 1960s and 70s and spans time to the present-day battle between infertile, wealthy secularists and revenge-minded nationalists/ Islamists (especially in the wake of the 2016 failed coup attempt).. The allegory is strong, the tragedy cuts like a knife. I can't recommend this book highly enough.","Dec 02, 2017"
62680378,Sarita,"The story evolves around Cem Celik, who was a teenage son of a leftist who in the mid 1980s is snatched from his family by the state police, and later abandons his home for more selfish reasons. This leaves Cem searching for a father substitute, which he finds in the figure of Master Mahmut, a well-digger who employs him as an apprentice.. ""A father is a doting, charismatic figure who will until his dying day accept and watch over the chiled he sires. He is the origin and the center of the universe. When you believe that you have a father, you are at peace even when you can't see him because you know that he is always there, ready to love and protect you. I never had a father like that."". During his time in Ongoren digging a well, he encounters the red haired woman, an alluring member of a travelling theatre company. She catches his eye and seems as fascinated by him as he is by her. Cem's wildest dream comes true but when a horrible accident befalls, Cem returns to Istanbul and continues his study.. Thirty years later, a well-established and childless Cem, returns to Ongoren and all mysteries unfold.. Throughout the novel, Pamuk heavily references to two ancient and opposite tragedies of fathers and sons: Oedipus Rex by Sophocles and the classic Persian Shahnameh by Ferdowsi. These two classic tales become both Cem's obsession and destiny.. ""Life follows myth!"" I said, electrified. ""Wouldn't you agree?"". ""I do,"" said Ayse politely.. More than exploring a father-son relationship, the story also explores duality. East and West, rich and poor, leftist and rightist, tradition and modernity, religion and secularism, ancient tale and reality.. ""Our wealthy, Westernized classes are so obsessed with individualism, they've forgotten how to be themselves, let alone how to be individuals,"" he said. ""these Westernized Turks are too conceited to believe in God. Their individuality is all they care about. Most choose not to believe in God just to prove they're not like everyone else, though they won't even acknowledge that's the reason why."". I felt it was my curiosity about Orhan Pamuk that made me pick this book and started off enthusiastically. There are three parts and as soon as I got into the second part, I grew bored of it and wondered if I would have enough patience to go through. However, the story twisted towards the end and it was gripping! Needless to say, I am glad I pushed through and will read more of his works in the future.","Dec 21, 2018"
68856156,Julian Douglass,"This is an interesting book in the sense that you really need to pay attention to the dead part in the middle to fully get the plot. The first part of the book takes over a month where Cem is trying to understand who he is and what he wants to do with his life. He meets a beautiful Red Haired woman and is completely captivated by her. Because of this distraction, he nearly kills his boss and then runs away, never to return.. The second part speeds his life up from the late 1980's to about today, where Cem becomes a successful business owner, and then ruins his life from a issue in his past, all of which follows the story of two ancient plays that he becomes obsessed with as he ages and cannot bear a child.. The second part starts off really slow, and it is almost like Mr. Pamuk completely forgets the first part of the book until the very end, when there is a kinda big ""What the Fuck"" moment that brings you back into the story.. The third part of the book wraps up the story, but told in the perspective of the Red-Haired Lady, which in my mind is a little too long.. Overall, the book really flows but you will have to power through the middle to get to the good part of the book. Great was to bring Greek and Persian Mythology into a modern setting. Almost reads like a Shakespeare tragedy. Fun characters and a really good survey of Modern Turkey too","Apr 10, 2019"
655113,Bob Lopez,"A man recounts an incident that occurred during 1 particular month of his youth--and the issues from that incident spring up later in life. It's like he took a page from his diary from some time in the 80s, wrote half a book about it, and took another page well into adulthood with those same characters, and wrote the rest of the book. It's a very good book, and Pamuk is a very good writer. He turned what could've been a conventional, hum-drum book about a teenager falling in love with a woman into a novel of great depth, a novel about memory, and fear, and fatherhood. I mean, sure, it's clearly written by a dude, and has some lame, dude-ish ideas (I mean, the woman is in her mid-30s but gives a 15/16 y/o a bone because he's her ex-lover's son, and this is passed off as some playful dalliance...but I digress), but the writing is strong and compelling.","Jul 13, 2018"

52715479,ianca rebel,"I was reluctant to even continue this book, however some mystical force drew me to not let it go - ah, oh, so rewarding the feeling I didn't! I could barely resist its last 150 pages, when the story really began to unfold and create some tension.. I admire Pamuk's work and ultimately found it enticing. It is a story about fathers, sons, and fatherless sons, and their twisted connections, a history which almost repeats itself. It is partly also a story about the urbanization of Istanbul and its Westernization.. Without giving away too many details, I would just say: if you feel like reading something different, with a trace of mythical tales, and above all, if you have patience to get over the well-digging apprenticeship descriptions, then read it.","Jan 15, 2018"
8801579,Cindy Leighton,"""logic dictates that Rostam should have had to pay some kind of price for killing his son. But there was no punishment at the end of this tale from the East- only the reader's sorrow. Wasn't anyone going to make the Eastern father pay?"". Who would think a book where the main action centers around a young, fatherless boy and his master digging a deep well by hand would be so compelling? This part of the three part book was actually the best part for me. So much East meets West, focusing on the folktales of Oedipus and the Eastern version of Rostam an dSohrab - a 10th century Persian epic. The entire book centers around these tales of fathers accidentally killing sons and sons accidentally killing fathers and young men being ""too attached"" to their mothers. Since the book also discusses at length fate vs freedom, East vs West, tradition vs modernity - we assume the entire book that the reality will mirror the fables.. I like this much better than the first two Pamuk books I read - Snow or My Name is Red. Although I'm still not sold on his being a Nobel prize winning author. The end of the book, told from the point of view of the Red-Haired woman, felt rushed and out of place. Pamuk's skill is not telling a story from a woman's point of view. But the first 2/3 of the book were intriguing and well worth reading.","Mar 24, 2018"

Then once it happened I couldn't put it down as I needed to know what the consequences were. The ending however I don't think I liked, without giving anything away it kind of ended poetically and I can see why it had to end like that but then I felt it was a bit odd. The stories in the book that the main character obsesses over mean that things had to end as they do in those stories however when the confrontation happens I felt they weren't talking like normal people. Especially the main character who didn't even attempt to explain things which annoyed me. If he had though then things might have been different and there wouldn't have been such a nice poetic ending as in the stories he loved.","Mar 01, 2019"
18083001,Teri Stich,"Interesting, modern, exploration of the myths and legends involving Oedipus, Rostam and Sohrab, and the world of father and son relationships. Slow moving prose but still captures and keeps one's interest, though a bit tedious and repetitive in places. Taking place just outside Istanbul, I did appreciate learning a bit more about this part of the world and its development. Fatherless young man, becomes apprentice to a well digger who he starts to look to a father figure. Young man becomes obsessed with mysterious older woman, serious accident happens and the long term consequences of those short several weeks as well as the hidden past coming to light..

Orhan is a master story teller, of-course, but the mood of the book felt a bit rushed in the end.. The main thesis of the book, that is western father-son story, Oedipus Rex, vs Eastern story, Rustam and Sohrab from Shahnama, is, although was examined in detail, was not reached to a satisfactory conclusion.. I finished the book and kept wondering - its like a you eat a meal and still feel unfulfilled.. Also the protagonist's son's blame, that the father abandoned him, were not logical, as Cem didn't knew he had a son till the DNA test. So how can he be blamed???.

According to me, the best part of the novel is the last part where the perspective of the story changes from that of Mr. Cem to that of the Red Haired Woman..

He has woven a tale that is simple in laguage and drags you into the tale right from the very beginning. A tale set predominantly in a village of Turkey.. The book is divided into 3 parts, each giving the reader a better view of the incidents in the story of Cem, his master and obviously the Red-haired woman. A very refreshing tale taking the reader into the life of the characters in Istanbul. The story with heavy references to Oedipus got a bit predictable towards the end but I'm not complaining.","Mar 06, 2018"

7508838,Sabeena,"Still hungover with Orhan's Snow i dived into The Red Haired Woman with extreme fervour! The Black Book and Snow had similarities which i thought i might see as underlying themes in Pamuk's writing- some dark psychology, a brooding male protagonist at odds with society, the clash of eastern and western thought, political unrest, a sort of sense of exploration/investigation, considerable amount of soul-searching, heartbreak..just to name a few! And usually this is Masterfully revealed by Pamuk. Perhaps i was expecting a similar experience with TRHW but this book has left me in another level of fascination for his writing!. The story, the plot, the way it unfolds, the well-rounded convincing characters, and a beautiful prose laced with cultural, historical and philosophical gems. Stories within stories, morals, questions, ruminations, guilt, love, heartbreak... all done with a flair of genius that only Pamuk knows.. I devoured this book in 3 days (its a relatively short read with 253 pages, but thats good because i can read it again!).. Too many beautiful lines and quotes to choose from but this one which is fresh in my mind:. 'Of course you know best how your novel should start, but i think it ought to be sincere and mythical at the same time, like the monologues i used to deliver at the end of our performances. It should be as credible as a true story, and as familiar as a myth'. I couldnt think of a better way to describe this story; all the magic of a myth and all the credibility of modern works. A completely and utterly satisfying read.","Nov 05, 2018"

The themes it depicts are old but new. One thing I disliked is the plot twist where Cem finds the truth he has been denying for a while or maybe just couldn’t see it, for I thought it’s kind of weak narration on the author’s part. The ending is expected but devastating simultaneously. I would recommend this book for those interested in Greek myths and traditional folktales..

93731898,Cinnamon,"The Red Haired Woman by Orhan Pamuk summed up in two words: Daddy issues.. Cem’s absent father and associated baggage defines his life. As a youth, he finds a father figure in the well-digger he is apprenticed to one summer, in a sultry, sleepy town where he meets the Red-haired woman. An accident causes him to flee the place one night, but questions and guilt haunt him well into adulthood.. Growing obsessed with exploring patricide and filicide, Cem is drawn especially to the legends of Oedipus, and Rustom and Sohrab. When he returns to the town thirty years later looking for answers, it turns out ghosts from the past have been looking for him too.. Metaphors and symbolism are to be found all over the place, along with repeated references to Rustom and Sohrab; and Oedipus. The Red Haired Woman, rather than a retelling of these stories, is more of a re-shouting.. I felt that the writing was atmospheric and evocative in the first third, later on, it just got downright clunky. I guess translations of books never really convey 100% of the original.. Orhan Pamuk is generally hailed as a brilliant writer, maybe I will have to read more of his books to get into this style of writing. The Red Haired Woman, I think, is not a good place to start.","May 01, 2020"

16307827,Namita,"This was the first Orhan Pamuk novel I have read. Having heard a great deal about him from some of my colleagues, friends and professors who share a similar taste in novels, I expected a bit more out of this.. The first half was extraordinary. The poetry in the writing combined with the simple style of storytelling was nothing like I had ever read before. Taking a simple idea of a father-son bond, the insecurities inherent in patriarchy and the extreme notion of patricide to poetic and philosophical heights isn't a new feat. But to give it a modern spin and gracefully weave it in a mundane story about a lower middle class boy; moreover retain the poetic flavour and add to the philosophy was definitely an imaginative feat and step in the right direction for evolving art. However, the plot dwindled in the second half and lost its poetry to mindless intonation of the same ideas over and over again. The end left me wanting for a better closure. Keeping in mind that I read the English translation, and the poetic quality could have been lost or subdued owing to that fact, the hollowness of the philosophy in the second half did not redeem the book in any way.. One great quality of this book was the loving manner in which the author describes Turkey. The country is a living breathing character in the book. For the pleasure of reading that alone I would recommend any book.","Nov 21, 2017"
51987406,Sam Davison,"I found this book a little disappointing, having always loved Orhan Pamuk's books. While there are many good, familiar things about it, not least the descriptions of the art of digging wells, and the vocative passages that give life to a bygone Istanbul, the writing was at times very cliched and stiff. Despite all that, I was sorry to finish it.","Feb 15, 2018"
69040653,Doug,"This is a suspenseful and stimulating story, though perhaps not as rewarding as it ought to be. The first part deals with digging a well and there are many factors at work – whether they will strike water, the disintegrating relationship between Cem and the master well-digger, the infatuation with the red-haired woman – and winding through all of this the power of story-telling. Not only the power, but the predictive qualities of myth and legend, the idea of fate being inescapable. This is the foundation of the novel and what keeps us turning the pages. We are handed two stories in particular – Oedipus, where the son unknowingly kills the father, and Rostam and Sohrab, where the father unknowingly kills the son – and the reader is swept along wondering how these fateful stories are going to play out here.. It’s a tall order and Pamuk doesn’t entirely satisfy. Like both classic myths, it’s a contrived resolution. But worse, Pamuk’s version lacks resonance. Whereas the two myths shock and move us with their finales, Pamuk cannot do the same because we are anticipating a shock. We have been thoroughly forewarned. What we really need here is either resonance or supreme cleverness. Frankly, given all the build-up, ending this short novel with a topper of an ending seems like a Herculean task.. The novel is divided into three parts. Before the well, after the well, and a long epilogue narrated by the red-haired woman herself. That final epilogue feels like a lot of exposition, though it is interesting to consider that all that melodrama was being lived out while Cem blissfully lived his life, completely unaware, like a parallel universe.. Unlike the recent Home Fires by Shamsie, which retold Antigone in a very clever and powerful way, Pamuk went into his variations on a classic myth without much of a hook. Ultimately, I felt little when the story was over. The idea of life reflecting myth was a very interesting one, but though it is thoroughly discussed by various characters, the story didn’t pan out in any meaningful or thought-provoking way, leaving us with the seeds of an idea, rather than something fully formed. Perhaps Pamuk simply drew too much attention to the idea, setting us up for a letdown?. On the other hand, for two-thirds of the novel, I was putty in Pamuk’s hand, swept away by the mood and the action. If the idea of the self-realizing myth was more promise than fulfillment, there are still lots of other ideas to sink your teeth into, like the authoritarian well master by day (father figure by night) as a sort of cultural representation of Turkey itself, or the red-haired woman choosing her hair color as opposed to red-haired women who inherit it and what that insinuates about free-will and fate, or the opposition of the West that regards Oepidus’ oblivious crimes to be beyond horror to the East that consider Rostam’s crime to be heart-breaking but legitimate. Though it is short, it’s hardly an empty book. It was my first Pamuk novel and I completely recognize why he is so lauded. I’m already looking forward to another.","Jan 08, 2018"
5600753,Mirek Jasinski,"I liked ""The Red-Haired Woman"". I liked it more than Pamuk's last two novels. It was simple, without literary embellishments, and yet complex in meaning. The father-son relationship (or the lack of it) and the effect it has on our formation as human beings. The Oedipus complex or the opaque Persian story of ""The Shahnameh"" by Ferdowsi or the suffering of Abraham who was asked to kill his son in sacrifice. And all of those interwoven in one single story of a boy, who is left by his father and who fathers his son at the age of 16, without knowing it.","Feb 11, 2018"

The middle, that is,once the hero becomes an engineer, marries, and finds financial success, tends to drag. I suppose that semi complacency of Cem’s life, though riddled with just beneath the surface guilt, leads the reader to the next phase of discovery. I liked it.

9086236,Chaitra,"I don't think Orhan Pamuk's books and I get along. I haven't liked the two previous books I've read of his, and this one is no exception. However, that being said, this is more accessible, even based on an over the top premise. It worked for. Oedipus Rex. and. Rostam and Sohrab. true. But updating either didn't make any sense, and what sympathy I might have been able to muster for any of the characters, I lost because of the ridiculousness that comes from making the book hew so close to the originals.. On paper, I liked the intellectual exercise, because though the stories are similar in vein, they're diametrically opposite in conclusion. Oedipus unwittingly kills his father, while in Rostam and Sohrab, it's the father who kills his son. For a long while, there's Cem casting himself as Oedipus which comes true in more ways than one, and when the existence of his son comes to light, he thinks himself Rostam.. But in practice, it's just too much. And there's way too many repeats of the same theme that it became slightly ridiculous. I also wanted nothing to do with the red-haired woman, I did not understand for her motivations for doing anything she did, which is in line with how I feel about the women in Pamuk books. They are objects of immense beauty, but I know nothing about their inner life because it's not in the book.. Pamuk is a nobel prize winner, and one day I hope I will read a book of his that will finally click with me. But. The Red-Haired Woman. is not that book.","Oct 26, 2017"

17131437,Peter,"I confess to being an Orhan Pamuk fan. His books about life in Turkey and about East vs. West are written in a low-key conversational style that I find appealing. Like the ripples on a stream that reflect the rocks at the bottom, Pamuk’s stories gently move you along until you feel the structure under the surface. His excavations of his characters’ inner lives are strange but strangely attractive. So I'll begin with a quick overview of Pamuk's work.. Orhan Pamuk's. Oeuvre. Pamuk’s work is diverse but with a number of common features. It is often about the tension between East and West, as in my favorite, the 1998. My Name is Red. (1998). This is a murder mystery set in the 16th century Ottoman Empire when the empire was experiencing fierce religious debates about whether art should be Eastern or Western. That novel’s first sentence may have led to his 2006 Nobel Prize in literature,. I am a corpse.. Pamuk’s themes also are often political—the tension between socialist revolution and the conservative state, the tension between Eastern and Western thought. An example is. Snow. (2004), about a Turk trapped in a remote Anatolian town by a blizzard when a struggle between revolutionary and conservative groups breaks out.. Some of Pamuk’s books are less global, more introspective, and more personal, often immersed in nostalgia, melancholy, and obsession, a state the Turks call. hüzün. . A prime example is his. The Museum of Innocence. (2008) about a man who loses the love of his life in youth and spends the rest of his life collecting mementos of her; he dies without regret.. At the personal level Pamuk’s characters have certain traits. They are trapped by Fate, they experience traumatic losses, Fate overrides their choices in determining the paths—in. The Red-Haired Woman. (2015) several generations experience filicide or patricide akin to that in Sophocles’. Oedipus Rex. (patricide) and the Persian. The Shahmeneh. (filicide). Here Pamuk states clearly that “Life follows Myth,” telling us that our past and our social memory shape our lives.. Yet another theme about individuals is that they experience traumatic losses and experience the consequences of their choices. In. The Museum of Innocence. the protagonist loses his love and chooses between remembering the past and looking to the future, selecting the former and living a monastic life of anonymity.. The Red-Haired Woman. In. The Red-Haired Woman. (2015) the narrator and protagonist is a young man named Cem. Cem’s father, a pharmacist with revolutionary leanings, has disappeared into the labyrinth of Turkish justice—and not for the first time. Cem is destined for university when he is offered a short-term job as a well digger’s assistant. Fearing that this will pull him off of his destined path, his mother resists, but what can a mother do when immediate wages beckon?. Cem heads off to the new well site with his boss, Master Mahmut, and another assistant, Ali. He learns a lot about traditional water finding and digging equipment, and he relates to Mahmut as a son would to a father. While going to a nearby village for supplies, Cem casually passes by the home of an attractive young red-haired woman who gives him an “I know you” smile, a smile that sets off an obsession; the passing is brief, but the effect is lasting.. The well being dug near the Red-Haired Woman’s village takes an unusually long time (it’s those damn rocks) so Master Mahmut and Cem swap stories that inform us about the novel’s intent. First, Cem tells Mahmut the Greek story of. Oedipus the King. : Oedipus unknowingly kills his father and becomes king in his place (hence marrying his mother who bears his children), but makes the mistake of vowing to find his father’s killer; when he finds that he is the killer he blinds himself.. Mahmut then tells Cem of a king who has a dinner party to which he invites Azrael, the angel of death. Azrael is surprised to find the King’s son at the party and the King, noting the surprise and thinking that Azrael might be there to get the Prince, sends the Prince to Tabriz in Persia for safety. It turns out that Azrael’s surprise at seeing the Prince was not because he was supposed collect the Prince’s soul in the King’s palace, it was because Azrael didn’t expect to see the Prince in the King’s palace—God had told Azrael to collect the Prince in Tabriz! Thus, the King had done precisely what God required of him to lose his son. God works in mysterious ways and His Will. will. be done! Here we learn that Man cannot bend Fate. In modern parlance, “Man Plans and God Laughs.”. After nearly a month of digging by day—the well is now 100 feet deep—and of stalking the Red-Haired Woman by night, Cem finally meets her and discovers that she is an actress at a traveling show called the Theater of Morality that in politically inclined morality plays and folk tales. An Actress—Oh, Oh! Also, her husband is in the troupe. A Husband—Oh, No! Not just that, but she knew Cem’s father from revolutionary circles.. We fear that our Cem has got himself into something deeper than a well. When she—a 33-year old—takes the 16-year old Cem to her bed we know something is very wrong in Pamuk’s theater of morality. Cem, of course, feels some adolescent guilt about fornicating with the Red-Haired Woman—he’s too innocent to realize that the guilt is hers to bear. But the tryst is cut short by a terrible accident (or was it murder?) at the well.. Cem returns home, gets educated as a geologist, finds and marries a woman, and—though carrying a brick of guilt—moves forward in his life. He chooses to forget the incident at the well—and almost does—but he can’t forget the Red-Haired woman. But can anyone really move on? Did Oedipus just say, “well, Dad is dead and Mom’s in my bed. Time to move on?”. This is a morality play about the eternal tensions between fathers and sons, about the obligations they have to each other, about the effects of ignoring those obligations, and about the inevitability of meeting your fate. It is also about the surprising connections between us.. The Red-Haired Woman. is one of Pamuk’s least opaque works, a feature I found refreshing.. Oh, and what about the Red-Haired Woman? I know that you've got two questions—the answers are “No” and “Yes.”. Five Stars.","Dec 19, 2017"
1391890,Philip,"Simplicity is a very complex concept. ‘Keep it simple’ is good advice, but not if its result is a dumbing down of content or a dilution of ideas towards the patronizingly inane. Simplicity, when it indicates an elegant and succinct portrayal of otherwise complex material, is what writers often seek, but rarely achieve. For some truly great artists the quality is achieved apparently without effort. This is the quality and the power of illusion.. An impressive example of this complexity of the apparently simple can be found in The Red Haired Woman by Orhan Pamuk. So much fiction takes the form of a biography that examples need not be listed. These life stories take many forms, from chronological sequence to end-of-life recollection, from jumbled memories to self-analysis. Very few would follow the highly original form of Orhan Pamuk’s novel and, crucially, the reader of this book will not be aware of its experimental originality until the end, perhaps even some time after finishing the book.. The Red Haired Woman is in the three distinct parts. The novel’s principal character is called Cem, though the narrative is well developed before we are aware of any name. In the first part, Cem is still at school. His impoverished family cannot raise the cash to enable the lad to attend a crammer to assist his studies, so he takes a holiday job labouring for a well digger. We are aware, though never explicitly, that there are complexities in these familial relationships. We are in Istanbul, where we habitually find Orhan Pamuk, but thirty years ago when the city had not sprawled to its current extent and perhaps where certain things were not discussed openly.. Mahmut, master of his trade, is the well digger. He and his two helpers begin to work on sloping ground in Őngőren which, at the time, is a sleepy little place beyond the city limits, where everyone knows everyone else's business and where modernization is just on the horizon. The well diggers go about their task during the day and retire to a bar in town most evenings. There is a theatre group in the town, and one of its members is a thirty-something woman with red hair. Cem becomes obsessed with her beauty and, as often is the case in Orhan Pamuk’s fiction, the sensation becomes all-consuming for this young and impressionable man. Stubbornly, the well excavation does not yield its goal and Cem extends his stay in Őngőren. Perhaps predictably, encounters with the red-haired woman do much to educate the young man. Eventually the labourer leaves the project in strange circumstances before it is finished to return home to Istanbul, leaving behind in Őngőren things that will continue to haunt him.. In part two of The Red Head Woman, we meet Cem again, but now he is an adult, university trained - so the crammer the labouring paid for did at least some good - and on the way to becoming a rich property developer, a significant but perhaps not major force in Istanbul’s modernisation. He is aware of much that he left behind in Őngőren, since the summer of well digging has left many indelible memories. These are brought into sharp focus when a contract to redevelop parts of the area comes across his desk and Cem decides to pursue the project. He thus needs to re-visit to the area and re-tread the only partially recognizable paths he trod during that personally influential summer some three decades previously. Some of the characters he knew those years ago are still around. Some of the issues that motivated dissent are still in focus.. Part three of the book is written after Cem's involvement with Őngőren has concluded. It is in this section that we hear a different perspective on Cem’s life and to reveal its detail in a review would devalue the impact of the book. Suffice it to say that from this different perspective, Cem's actions and memories take on a wholly different character. We knew all along that there was potential for consequences, but Cem never thought to find out what might have happened. But reality catches up, and resentment grows when it is ignored. All experience is particular, and we must all be aware that individual perspectives are nothing more than that, individual. It is the consequences that are shared.. But Orhan Pamuk’s The Red Haired Woman is much more than an individual fictional life. The well diggers, visiting the bar in Őngőren, chat about many things. Repeatedly, two stories are examined from different viewpoints. Oedipus, a man condemned to murder his father and marry his mother, is one. A perspective the well diggers explore is that Oedipus is not aware of the curse that directs his life, and that even when he consciously tries to avoid it shackles, the power of fate further condemns him to its confines. The second story, from the Shahmaneh, features Sohrab and Rostam. Almost counterbalancing Oedipus, this story has a father kill his son. And it is these themes, pre-determination, fate, the paternal, maternal and filial, and then eventually powerlessness that form an intellectual backbone in the work. Cem the property developer is set to modernize the place that did so much to influence his personality, his outlook on life and his future. But the place will reassert itself in his life in a different, wholly unpredicted way that Cem, himself, created, but can neither influence nor control. The patricide and the filicide of the stories that obsessed Cem in his youth eventually fight it out in this brilliant book.. The Red Haired Woman, this short, accessible and apparently simple novel thus develops intellectual and philosophical dimensions, blended with its constant undercurrent of political identity and economic change. Only at the end does the reader become fully aware of the complexity of its themes, and how expertly Orhan Pamuk blends these apparently disparate ideas into a biographical whole called Cem, the principal character through which we experience an entire view of the world. And yet the reading of this book, start to finish, is always simple. The style is transparent and the reality is almost tangible. It is both personal and general, mundane and ontological, reassuringly simple and yet emotionally tangled and challenging. It is a perfect example of how simplicity is it the heart of the complex. Or was that the other way around?","Nov 03, 2018"
16168486,Kenneth Iltz,"Orhan Pamuk is a Turkish novelist and recipient of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature. He is Turkey’s best known and best-selling writer. I have read several of his books. The Red-Haired Woman is not one of my favorites. It is not your typical novel and it is worth your time to read. You can easily invest the time with this short 250 page novel.. Cem was a teenager when his father left him and his mother and the pharmacy that had supported their family in a suburb of Istanbul. During a school break, he becomes an apprentice to a well digger, Master Mahut, and the two are hired to find water on a large, empty plot of land in a small city near Istanbul. While working for Master Mahut, Cem is enticed by an older, red-headed woman who is part of a traveling theater company. He has an affair with her. Afterwards, because of an accident at the well (no spoilers here), Cem returns home.. He ultimately becomes a wealthy real estate developer but his past ultimately catches up with him.. The novel is much more complex than my short summary. If you haven’t read a book by Orhan Pamuk, this book is a good initiation to his work.","Aug 27, 2017"
1655341,Susan,"Pamuk's novel is a genre-bender: part mystery, part meditation, and part multi-perspectival novel.. I was most fascinated with Pamuk’s visualization of two myths of blindness that illustrate author’s stated project of harmonizing the cultures of East and West meeting in Istanbul. Like the inseparable yin and yang of a black and white Tibetan amulet, the patricidal Oedipus myth is paired with the complementary Persian filicidal Shanameh.. The myths are not strictly reproduced; rather, they form the structure of the novel and refer to eternal truths in the main characters' psychology. Cem Celik hates but does not kill the father surrogate with whom as a teenager he has a summer job digging a well. There is much shadow play in Cem’s obsession for a traveling actress old enough to be his mother. After a successful career and placid, fruitless marriage, Cem meets his end at the hands of a bundle of hatred, the son he unknowingly fathered with her. His son must endure a living death in jail for patricide.","Oct 05, 2017"
39107097,Jonas,"Cem, a young adult from Turkey, is searching for a paternal figure and a way forward after his father abandons him and his mother. While teaming up with well-digger Master Mahmud he struggles to choose between trusting and obeying his Master and following his own dreams and aspirations, thus betraying Master Mahmud.. The story of Cem is a modern take on the classical tragedies of Oidipus, who kills his father, and of Sohrab, whose father kills him.. It is a reflection on a father’s expectations versus the young adult’s fight to break free and escape from what seems to be his destiny. In time the roles and perspectives change as the son becomes the father, the keeper of traditions. And so it goes.. Orhan Pamuk manages to blend these Darth Vader vs Luke Skywalker issues with description of typical Turkish opposites, such as a western culture and a secular state vs the Middle-Eastern philosophy and religious views..

Cem the narrator grew up for the most part longing for his absent father; the summer of his 17th year he worked as a well digger's apprentice. While regarding his boss as a father figure he was also busy falling in love for the first time, and losing his virginity. The story is broken into 3 unequal parts, I didn't really enjoy the first part made up of protracted and drawn out misery (I much prefer reading about Atonement, to Remorse). The second part involved a lot of nebulous immoral business practice, and the third part ""a statement for the defense to the criminal court,"" which I found to be concise. Although I wasn't at all surprised by the story developments, I did enjoy the thorough comparisons of Oedipus to Rostam, Sohrab and Shahnameh.","Oct 01, 2019"
14451554,Imran,"This is the second book by Orhan Pamuk, which I read after 'A Strangeness in my mind'. Though its short compared to the earlier novels, but it is equally informative and entertaining. Inspired from western myths (Oedipus from Greek mythology) and Eastern Legend (Rustom o Sohrab from Persian Shahnameh e Fedosi', this book talks about relationship between fathers and sons in an interesting way.. Loved to read about well digging occupation, which died few decades back. In Pakistan, dubbed Turkish soaps attracted audience attention and criticism from local artists at same time. Interesting to read that Turkish media also went through dubbed foreign contents in 1990s and 2000s.. If you love to know how societies change (technological as well environmental) and impact of such changes on people living in those societies, you must give this a try.","Oct 29, 2017"
14538532,Greg,"Cem, a bright teenager, takes a job as a well-digger's apprentice prior to going to college. In the evenings he spots an older red-haired woman involved in an acting troupe, and becomes infatuated. This leads to jealousies with his master and, ultimately, disaster.. In this novel, Pamuk plays around with the tensions in inter-generational relationships: father and son, master and apprentice, older woman and younger man. The book regularly draws on the myths of Oedipus and of Rostam and Sorhab. The first is a cautionary tale of patricide, the second of filicide, and Pamuk's plot makes us to wonder which of these he is leading up to.. This was a pretty good novel, but I didn't really like the way that Pamuk chose to wrap it up, trying to recast the story through another viewpoint, but coming across only as facile and unconvincing.","Dec 02, 2017"
9363671,Jill,"This is the story of a young man and his relationships set against the back drop of a rapidly modernizing Turkey. It is beautifully told in three stories, the first two narrated by Cem, one as an adolescent when he works as an apprentice well digger, the second as a prosperous adult. The third is told by the red-haired woman of the title. The Greek myth of Oedipus (patricide) and the Persian story of Rostam and Sohrab (filicide) are extensively discussed and while interesting this sometimes distracts from the story.","Jan 21, 2018"
68931288,Anne Doe,"Orhan Pamuk tried to stretch his ruminations about patricide and infanticide and the east and the west into a short, half-assed novel. But it's Pamuk, so his used up toilet paper would be rated with 3.5 stars, not his somewhat weaker novels.. The characters are pale and undefined, more of a sketch than fully developed personas. The plot is moving forward too slowly, mainly because it barely exists. There are only a couple of defining points in it, which I won't reveal. I didn't even find quotes worth remembering, which I usually do when I read his novels.. Regardless, his style is light, poetic and pleasing as always, which is enough to give this book a read. I won't give it two reads, though.","Jul 27, 2017"
17951290,Janelle Bailey,"52:. The Red-Haired Woman. by Orhan Pamuk...ahhhh, after a couple of slightly lackluster-for-me reads, a good book again! My criticism of my last read and its being potentially more enjoyable to one who knows Kafka well was totally redeemed with this one, as it heavily alludes to and plays on the stories of Oedipus and Abraham/Isaac, and my familiarity with those made this a very satisfying read. It also reminded me much of. Crime and Punishment. , and though it mentioned the title one time, I had already been thinking about how much Cem reminded me of a contemporary Raskolnikov. I also enjoyed the time I ""spent in Turkey"" while reading this book and also its entangled layers of story. Pamuk has not disappointed me yet. His books are worth the work.","Sep 30, 2017"
9559146,Ruby,"Yet another beauty from Pamuk, the story telling in this happens at various levels, and to intertwine that is beautiful.. The book takes it heart from the epics Like Oedipus and Rostam Sohrab and that adds on to the old world charm.. Also the narrative is lucid, flowing and at times the books becomes unputdownable.. The characters like Master Mehmut gives the story the spine. and deals with the theme of innocent and guilty. The father son relationship is tackled through various sets of father son stories.. The background of Turkey and its changing in the timeframe of 40-50 years is captured very subtly.. The red haired woman who gets her say in the Part 111, gives a lot of food for thought when she says. "" Life follows myths""","Oct 08, 2017"
10079154,Michael,"A brand new novel from the Turkish writer, Mr Pamuk has set upon us another fable of the current situation in Turkey, this time as a bit of coming of age story, a bit of a mystery, a bit of political intrigue. It is a story of fathers, sons in fable and real life and the desires that can come between. The story follows Cem from youth to being a successful businessman. One Summer as Cem is ready to leave High School, his own Father having abandoned the family and thus lacking funds to study for the university entrance exams he takes a Summer job as an apprentice to a well digger on the outskirts of Istanbul. The events of that Summer shape Cem's future on a variety of levels. I enjoyed this book and its many twists and turns. It is a quick read.","Nov 17, 2017"
59286055,Kelsey,"My partner asks me why I continue reading Pamuk's fiction — I've read ""Snow,"" ""The Museum of Innocence,"" ""A Strangeness in My Mind,"" and ""The White Castle"" and each time have been disappointed by the novel's mediocrity.. After being blown away by his memoirs about İstanbul, I expected fiction that was equally stunning, but after reading ""The Red-Haired Woman,"" I am officially giving up on Pamuk's fiction. There was potential here, but ultimately, the metaphors about filicide and patricide, Oedipus and Sohrab, the sightings of the red-haired woman, and the slow revelation about the form of the novel itself, all fell flat.. Stick to his non-fiction if you want more than a soup of loose metaphors and unremarkable prose.","Nov 25, 2017"
1932971,Ankush,"My book this weekend was Orhan Pamuk’s The Red Haired Woman.. Tempted by its jacket cover, which informed me of ‘the tension between fathers and sons’, and which had in its epigraph, three quotes; two, alluding to Oedipus Rex and one from Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh, I quickly picked it up, assuming this would be Pamukian equivalent of Rushdie’s Haroun and the Sea of Stories, or Ishiguro’s The Buried Giant. And true, the Red Haired Woman did have the same high-quality fable kind of atmosphere, but lacked the consistency of narrative, and probably, the hyperbole which makes fables so lovable! Further, and not for the first time, the book has an unavoidable didactic strain – which manifested as an overabundant hammering of problematic father-son relations – and this, sort of took out all the fun from the writing!. To Introduce. The plot (expectedly) derives its overarching binary from two ancient and opposite tragedies of fathers and sons: Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex and the classic Persian tale of Rostam and Sohrab from Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh, or Book of Kings. In the former, Oedipus unwittingly murders his father; in the latter, the father, Rostam, unknowingly kills his son, Sohrab. These two classic tales become both the obsession of the novel’s protagonist, Cem Celik, and the determinants — or overdeterminants — of the novel’s action. The Sophocles tale not only comes out of the Western canon but its notion of the headstrong individualist who probes and questions and tempts fate is convenient shorthand for the would-be tradition-killers of Western modernity. In Ferdowsi, meanwhile, the father who kills his son can stand in for an old-against-young, backward-looking extremism, wielding an airless adherence to tradition against any would-be modernizing trends.. Cem Çelik is a “little gentleman”, the son of a leftist Istanbul pharmacist whose politics take precedence over parenthood. During one of his father’s lengthy and regular disappearances, Cem, who is 16 when the novel opens, gives up his holiday job guarding his uncle’s orchard and apprentices himself to a master well-digger, Mahmut. He is taken to the (fictional) town of Öngören, a down-at-heel military base outside Istanbul, where he, Mahmut and another apprentice set about digging a well to provide water for a local businessman’s factory. During one of his sojourns here, he comes across and subsequently gets enamoured/sexually obsessed by the eponymous ‘Red Haired Woman’. What happens between him and her, and how all of it comes together in the end lies at the heart of the novel.. Discussions. Spoiler Alert. Cem apparently impregnates the Red Haired Woman, who, as we get to know later, much later, had also been Cem’s father’s lover. Eventually, Cem escapes the drudgery of digging the well, and in the process accidentally injures Master digger Mahmut, under whom, he was serving as a apprentice. They develop a filial bond, and Mahmut assumes the role of a foster father to a fatherless Cem. After his escape, he presupposes that he had killed Mahmut, and such Oedipal guilt is part of his active conscience. Carrying this guilt, he completes his studies, marries Ayse and grows in stature as a real estate developer, heading the construction company, which the couple choose to name – Sohrab – as they themselves remain childless. The Red Haired Woman bears the child, a boy named Enver, who, for a long time, she assumes to be her husband, Turgay’s son, but surmises later (one of the first major weak points of the novel), is or must be Cem’s son.. In the second part of the book, we meet Enver – at once a haughty, angry, maladjusted boy, who, it seems, has grown up in the shade of the two epic narratives at the heart of the book. His preoccupation with fatherhood, not having a father, feeling an intense anger for his father, not Turgey, but Cem, both of whom had ‘abandoned’ him and his mother – stretches the reader’s willingness to disbelieve a little farther than would deem logically or emotionally possible.. I kept asking myself – why on earth would he hate Cem? – Cem wasn’t even aware that he had sired a boy! – and much later, is dawns on us that this plot is driven by the Oedipus-Lais/Rostam-Sohrab narrative, and so, either the climax would inevitably contain either father killing the son or vice versa.. And that is what happens! One of them kills the other – and this, I felt was the weakest part of the book as the plot and narrative seemed to laboriously move towards that predestined end!. In the end, one isn’t sure, this is a fable, or a Turkish melodrama – and that is where it fails – to define what the book wants to be.. A Word on the Translation. Further, Ekin Oklap’s translation doesn’t seem to do justice to the book. Oklap’s incessant reliance on dead language does great injury to Pamuk’s already damaged tale. Oklap can barely get through a paragraph without enlisting the most dancing cliches: from “lost in thought” to “a lost cause,” from “the crack of dawn” to “the evening chill.” Some lines consist entirely of stock phrasing: “He’d languished in prison, but unlike some others, he hadn’t changed his tune.” Here are some truly inept English sentences: “A vision of the Red-Haired Woman would dawn in my mind out of nowhere like a sultry sun”; “A parched tenderness lay dormant inside me, ready to bloom at the first sign of moisture.” Add to that the stuttering alliteration — “beaming bucktoothed, busty wife” — and you have the worst translation Pamuk has ever suffered in English.. Final Word. If you want to read Pamuk, pick up Snow, My Name is Red, or Museum of Innocence.. I would not rate this as one of this best works, or even, one of his second-best works.. Thanks. Happy Reading.","Apr 15, 2018"
14196621,Alexandra,"I am a big fan of Pamuk's work and I am always excited to read his books, but this novel is not my favourite work of his.. Most of Pamuk 'ingredients' are here - the magic like atmoshere, the West-East duality, the beautiful prose (albeit less poetic than his previous works). The story seems to lack, however, in depth, and so do the characters.. Pamuk is an erudite writer, succesfuly blending political, societal, cultural and historical analysis, but he seems to overdo it this time. The myths are overly exaplained and overly used and this is not in the benefit of the story or the characters.. But exploring obsessions is something Pamuk is very skilled at and this is, in the end, a good novel.","Mar 01, 2019"
9411460,Sharon,"Thanks to Harry Hartog Booksellers for the ARC. This was my first Orhan Pamuk novel, and while it begins in a fairly simple form, the layers and complexity of the plot unravel to devastating effect by the conclusion. Young Cem, abandoned by his father, spends a life-changing summer in a small town outside Istanbul, apprenticed to a well-digger. Thirty years later, the echoes of that summer come back, interwoven with Greek and Persian myths and the complex relationships between fathers and sons, and the grief of mothers. Rich with symbolism and memory, this is a beautiful, tragic work I would highly recommend.","Jun 15, 2017"
1744565,Holly,"I was captivated by Part One of this book. The writing and Pamuk's simplicity of wording conveying so much really entranced me. However, then after Part One I felt as though the book fell apart a bit and became almost a travelogue of the main characters thoughts. Part Two was dry and often uninteresting, laboring over a fascination that the main character has, which I found wasn't terribly fascinating. I have to admit that the final portion of the book picked up a bit but by then it was too obvious what was going to happen and the resolution of the book was anticlimactic. It is a very well written book though I'm not sure I would have finished it had it not been so short.","Sep 01, 2017"
301015,Tara,"'The Red-Haired Woman' is a multi-faceted novel, beginning with the simple, yet enchanting tale of a teenage boy's ill-fated apprenticeship with a well-digger in a village outside Istanbul, and his infatuation with an actress in a visiting theatrical troupe. In the middle section, we find the boy now an adult, and living comfortably but having shed most of his youthful ideals, and still obsessed with the past. The final section, narrated by the 'red-haired woman' herself, turns the story upside-down and unfurls an alternate version of events. Not having read Orhan Pamuk before, I can't compare this novel to his previous work but it made me want to read more.","Oct 07, 2017"

The rhythm stopped and it read more text-bookish rather than a story. I also didn't love the ending. I liked that the author gave us insight from the woman's point of view at the end so you know what happened, but it felt forced and added only because he know people would wonder ""what really happened""..

70653820,Ana,"I'd say that this book is quite different from other Pamuk's novels. I like that he stayed loyal to the entire east-west antagonism by comparing not only the two tragic stories, but also his views with his son's. I also like that he touches upon many problems of the Turkish society, both from past and presence. However, I think that the book became a bit dry at one point. He often repeated himself, especially when it comes to the stories of Oedipus and Rustam and Sohrab. I think Pamuk can do way better than this. Therefore I give it 3 starts. Not bad, but also not great.","Sep 15, 2017"

I liked that the setting was in Turkey, it was a different place than I normally read in books and the author did a good job of making me feel like I was there and really visualizing the scenes. It really kind of read like a fairy tale, but then the second half began to drag and the pace really slowed down. Nothing much was happening for a while and the story just lost something.

Very glad I did because the penny finally dropped and I realised I should be looking at this book as a very clever and intriguing retelling of the two myths intertwined, the Red-Haired woman's narrative at the end brought it all together so well, although I think a moment of blind rage cannot be excused as an accident.

This book was as intriguing and thought-provoking as ""A Strangeness in My Mind"", telling the story of a boy who fails his master and weaves a tangled fate from that moment to the end of his life. The mythology referenced in the book crosses cultures and time, and broaches classical themes that are still nevertheless shocking. Some of the ideas about cultural stereotypes linger for further thought. I look forward to reading more from this author.","Nov 14, 2017"

This book reminds me of his earlier work, The White Castle. As in the earlier work, this too takes a rollercoaster ride through identies, new and old; Turkey and its location, geographic and cultural; and of course, Pamuk's pet theme of the East meeting the West, while looking back with unabashed nostalgia of all that was lost in the encounter.","Jan 04, 2018"

He truly understands people and his descriptions of the mind of a young male Turk are second-to-none. The trouble for me was, I wanted to hear more about them, less about classic mythology.

To me, it had a documentary flavour, the style rather distant from its subject, particularly once the main character has overcome his adolescence. Perhaps the flatness of emotion hinges on the role of the red-haired woman, explained in the last section. Perhaps it was caused in part by the translation.

2309191,thewanderingjew,"The Red-Haired Woman, Orhan Pamuk, author, John Lee, Katharine McEwan, narrators. In Part One of the novel, Cem Celik is 16 years old. Because his father had abandoned his mother, he was forced to seek summer employment so that he could earn enough money to go to cram school before taking the exams for his higher education. Otherwise his future would be doomed. In this effort, he became an apprentice to Master Mahmut, the well-digger, and a close father/son relationship developed over a short period of time. On one evening, while walking with him, he spied a red-haired woman, Gulcihan, who seemed to catch his eye. He became enthralled with her. Cem is coming of age and feeling things that he had not felt before.. After a tragic event, in which his master is hurt in the well, Cem abandons him and runs away because he is afraid he will be accused of causing the accident which will ruin his life. He places his own well being before that of his master which is considered his greatest sin. Cem never speaks of what he did to anyone for many years, not even his future wife.. In Part Two of the book, years have passed and Cem is happily married, but childless. He and his wife are very compatible and carve out a life for themselves which is very secure financially. When someone claims to be his son, his life’s trajectory turns in a different direction. He discovers that many of the things he had believed for the previous three decades, that had haunted him through the years, were wrong.. In Part Three, the red-haired woman describes her acting career and her past love life including her relationship with Cem and Akin Celik, and Turhan and Turgay, her husbands. She has a son named Enver whose paternity has only recently been discovered. He has been charged with the murder of his father, and she attempts to explain why her son should be judged innocent of the crime he committed.. As the master and apprentice tell each other stories, of father/son relationships and the ensuing tragedies of fratricide and patricide their relationship deepens. Using Sophocles classic about Oedipus and Laius and The Shanamara, a Persian poem containing the legend of Rostam and Sohrab, the reader sees the troubled relationships in families, the difficulties between fathers and sons and the resultant dysfunction from those problems. There is often a deep resentment toward the absent parent for the lack of guidance that is desired from that parent. Politics and the absence of faith, in this case, the Muslim faith, is also blamed as there seems to be a lack of responsibility for one’s actions or an impulsiveness that leads to rash behavior, which religion might otherwise prevent, since irresponsible behavior would be absolutely forbidden.. The moral of the story seems to be the need for a strong father figure in a boy’s life in order for him to take the right path. The lopsided bond of mother and son, without the equal bond of father and son often leads to disastrous consequences. Resentments develop, sometimes without rational reasons, simply based on bitterness. The result of the relationship between Mahmut and Cem and between the red-haired woman and Cem, haunted our main character, and he was powerless to stop fate from intervening and changing the course of his life.. Several questions were posed to me. Why did Cem choose the wife he did? Was her similarity to his mother and the red-haired woman a motivating factor? Did he punish Master Mahmut and abandon him because he had been abandoned by his own father? Were his mother and Enver’s mother too close to their sons, not allowing them to mature in a stable way, not providing them with a way to respect themselves even though their fathers had abandoned them, whether willfully or otherwise? Should immaturity and youth be used as an excuse for reprehensible behavior? Does anyone escape ultimate judgment for their behavior? Abandonment, deceptions and secrets have grave consequences.. John Lee is one of my favorite narrators and he didn’t disappoint me. While Katharine McEwan did a fine job, I didn’t quite match her voice to the personality with which I had identified Gulcihan, the red-haired woman. I felt the red-haired woman was more complicit in the outcome of the novel, than comes across from her portrayal. The narrator’s voice radiated too much innocence for her part. There seemed to be a universal lack of responsibility on the part of the characters for their own behavior, with each blaming their personal misfortune on the behavior of someone or something else.. This novel will provide a great many controversial topics for discussion.","Oct 05, 2017"
8566154,Michael Rieman,"The Red-Haired Woman touches on several subjects and themes that have long informed Pamuk's writing. The comparison between Eastern and Western arts and ways of thinking, the beauty of the miniatures illustrating Eastern fables and tales (though not through the painter's or calligrapher's eyes this time), the contrast between tradition and change in society are all there, but there is a heightened emphasis on the father-son relationship that makes this novel unsettling.. He employs both the tale of Sohrab and Rostam and the Oedipus myth, one in which a father unknowingly kills his son and the other in which the son unknowingly kills his father, in what seemed to me at first an unnecessary ""education."" I had read both of those as a high school student and assumed that they were generally common knowledge, an aspect of cultural literacy. Indeed, an art librarian at Topkapi Palace tells Cem and his wife that the younger generation doesn't seem to care much about viewing the miniatures depicting old tales. Nonetheless, these tales have a powerful influence on characters in this novel, aside from the cultural interest which brings Cem and his wife to various European museums to ponder these works. That might be seen as the liberal, ""Westernized"" element in these people. The deeper emotional responses can be seen in the reactions of people who visit the theater troupe of which the Red-Haired Woman is a part. Her monologue over the death of her son, Sohrab, makes people weep. Angry reactions to Oedipus' relationship with Jocasta, his mother, even threaten to close down the theater at times. The stories, of course, mirror the tensions in the novel, and impact deeply on the characters.. That issue of the father-son dynamic increasingly fuels the novel, and gives its second half an unexpected power.. ""A father is a doting, charismatic figure who will until his dying day accept and watch over the child he sires. He is the origin and center of the universe."" These words, spoken in hostility, suggest the great need some young men have for a strong father, a need not often met in the real world I would think. How deep into the psyche does this reach? ""I never had a father like that,"" the young man states. But how many people actually do? Does this belief lead not only to anger, but to a desire for a strong father-figure, even an authoritarian one? In this novel, fathers are not always present and certainly are not heroic figures, but there seems to be a price paid. Cem's more modern marriage does not produce a child, though his business, named Sohrab, seems to take the child's place for the modern marriage.. In the end, Pamuk blends elements in the stories of Rostam and Sorhab with that of the Oedipus myth in a conclusion that leaves the reader troubled by what may have been an inevitable outcome.. This novel does not attain the beauty of a work like My Name is Red, but still is a meaningful and , I believe, personal statement from its author.","Oct 02, 2017"
11515392,Christine,"I was torn about this book. In the end I rated it 3 stars, but though I didn't ""really like this book,"" I found myself really interested in thinking about it and talking about it. I read a few other reviews on line (NYT Book Review, London Times, Evening Standard) and found that they also were conflicted about it.. There are certainly problems with the language (lack of important description and detail, repetitious--even banal--images when fresher ones are needed); some might be ascribed to the translator, but others come from the writer himself. And the story does become the prisoner of the archetypes (Eastern and Western) at times. But I find myself going back over it and thinking about the connections between the mythic figures and the characters in the story who begin to live out the stories of Oedipus and Sohrab (the son who kills and the son who is killed) and the constant intertwining and reflection of them on all levels of the novel.. At the heart of the novel, it seems to me, are two things: the image of the father and the image of the red-haired woman. Much of the novel's main protagonist's (Cem's) thought throughout his life centers on what a father is supposed to be, on what fatherhood means, on the characteristics of fathers, and fathers in myth and literature, though he himself has little experience of good fathers in his own life. And he turns out not to be such a good father himself, despite all his thinking about it. But the reader certainly is pulled into thinking about this theme and all the repercussions and connections set up in the story.. Where the image of the father is always in the foreground, the image of the red-haired woman remains mostly in the background, except in the seduction of the protagonist and the last part, in which she narrates the whole story again from her perspective (in which she was the seduced, not the seducer). At the beginning of her section, she takes pains to indicate that her red hair (and the image she cultivates with it) is all artifice, which in turn calls into question all that she narrates and her motivations for all her actions. Nonetheless, we are left at the end with a picture of her as the wailing, grieving lover and mother, bringing together the two myths that control the story.. Many of the reviewers kept using quotation marks around ""narrator"" because the end of the novel, which has the young man in prison writing down the whole story of his father and his mother, seems to suggest that that is what we have been reading. So exactly who the narrator is remains mysterious.. It's definitely worth reading and worth discussing seriously.","Jan 30, 2018"
23464063,Parvin Sultana,"Like all his other books, Orhan Pamuk’s The Red Haired Woman also bear witness to his love for the city of Istanbul. In this book also the protagonist faces push and pull of the city, its in betweenness in the realm of East and West, of modern and traditional and the sacred and the secular. Throughout the novel we find references to two ancient tragedies of fathers and sons – the Greek classic “Oedipus Rex” and the classic Persian Tale of Sohrab and Rostam from Ferdowsi’s book Shahname or The Book of Kings.. In the first tragedy Oedipus unknowingly kills his father while in the second one the father kills his son by mistake. Sophocles’ tragedy is not just a canonical western text but its headstrong individualist protagonists find resonance in non Western tales as well. Pamuk’s book also traces the life of Cem Celik whose father is more absent than present in his life. Cem’s Marxist father deserts his family after his release from prison. This puts financial constraints on Cem’s family. As a result he is forced to take up an odd job as a well digger’s apprentice. While the job was supposed to be only of two weeks, it took much longer. It was a challenging job where the site denied to yield water. The work drags on amidst rising tension and tempers.. Cem sees a fatherly figure in the well digger. And they often go to the nearby town during evening trips. There as a part of a theatre troupe Cem meets an enigmatic red haired woman. His attraction towards this woman causes tension in the workplace between Master Mehmut and himself because he imagines an involvement between them. Its interesting how the red haired woman responded to Cem’s approach. She reciprocated his interest sexually. But its only later we get to know why she did so.. Cem’s obsession with the red haired woman leads to an accident in the well digging site. It forces him to flee the place. His life takes many turns and he is forced to come back to that very place where he worked as a well digger’s apprentice many years ago. There he faces the consequences of his own actions – a son born out of his relationship with the red haired woman. We are taken into another estranged father son relationship. The later part of the book points to a repetitive reference to the two classical tragedies. The incidents of estrangement are way too many. Earlier English translations of Pamuk’s book were much better than this one which seems to be a case of careless prose or awkward translation.","Apr 02, 2018"
39252250,Kelsi H,"Please read all of my reviews at. http://ultraviolentlit.blogspot.ca. !. Ten years ago, I read Snow – my first book by Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk – and absolutely loved it. I haven’t been as impressed with Pamuk’s more recent work, although I’m not sure if it’s the slower pace, weighed down by symbolism and archetypical characters, or if my expectations are too high after my experience with Snow.. The Red-Haired Woman is heavily influenced by both western and eastern legends, specifically Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex and the Persian story of Rostam and Sohrab. Although these stories provide complex layers to the novel, they also sometimes make the characters feel less real and more like symbols for the themes that Pamuk is exploring here – the relationships between fathers and sons, the idea of individual freedom versus the government, and ultimately the gray areas between good and evil. It’s a lot to take on, and it explains why the story sometimes becomes dry and unable to hold the reader’s attention.. The novel is set in Istanbul in the 1980s. Cem is sixteen years old, and he spends his summer as the apprentice to a well-digger, Master Mahmut, in a small town outside the city. As they desperately search for water in the barren land surrounding them, they tell stories at night to pass the time, including the legends mentioned above, which both man and boy become fixated upon. Oedipus Rex, the story of a king who kills his father and marries his mother, specifically becomes a loose allegory for Cem’s larger lifelong struggles.. After a day of digging wells, Cem goes into town to visit the tent of some travelling performers who act out “morality tales” for the crowd. When Cem meets the older, married, red-haired woman who performs in the plays, he becomes obsessed and follows her around town. To Cem’s surprise, the two experience one night of passion together, before an accident at work causes Cem to flee back to Istanbul. His experiences that summer weigh him down with a sense of guilt and shame that follows him into adulthood.. Thirty years later, Cem and his wife have the opportunity to purchase the land where he dug the well that summer. When Cem travels back to the small town, he discovers that his past has not stayed buried as he expected – and the red-haired woman has a surprising secret for him. The mystery elements tie the novel together from start to finish, although the big reveal is certainly not surprising. The Red-Haired Woman is much more concerned with its multi-layered plot, rich in literary and historical references, than in developing the mystery or the characters themselves. Although the novel didn’t always hold my attention, I did appreciate the complex layers of story and history – and I think it will only get better with each re-read.. I received this book from Penguin Random House Canada and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","Oct 09, 2017"
67744034,Pretty Bibliophile,"I’m going to begin my review by quoting again, one blurb for this book that was present on the back cover, by Kirkus Reviews on The White Castle, “Elegant and intellectually provocative”. The Red-Haired Woman is a literary masterpiece and as a Pamuk virgin I fell in love with the writing style- almost like the lazy afternoons Cem spent under the walnut tree; rambling and peaceful.. The surroundings portrayed- with the political unrest, seemed very realistic as it pulls the reader in and makes him a part of the book. The cruel twist fate or destiny pulls in the blanket of our stars, makes it so difficult and strange for the people to accept the truth. Cem as an impressionable youth was portrayed as a vulnerable character, in need of a father-figure in his life, for his biological father could hardly be one. His frequent absences create in him the lifelong doubt that always gnaws away at his soul. So when he does find a father-figure in Master Mahmut, we see the dilemma he faces; there are times he feels an inexplicable bond with him and at other times, he is resentful, looking for possibly veiled barbs in whatever Master Mahmut said.. The whole story is beautiful tale and takes in and around Turkey and Istanbul. The scenic beauty that the author relays to the reader is of an arid and windy place, but unlike what we might imagine- there are buildings, electricity, communication lines etc., despite the contrasting pastoral and rustic imagery that come more easily.. Themes for filicide and patricide abound in this book, and Cem as the protagonist also recognizes how much he studies these two events, and yet, the themes of human relationships and human feelings, are perhaps the most dominant ones in this book.. I have also loved the red-haired woman but I do think that the author tries to keep her in the mystery surrounding her until the very end. Even the background we are provided for her is not enough to dispel the heavy fog surrounding this enigmatic woman. Nonetheless, she retained the peprfect bit of vagueness for me as a reader until the very end, despite the little bit of soul bearing that she does.. I rate this book a 4.5 out of 5 stars and rightly understand why it has been awarded the Nobel Prize; it is a literary masterpiece, I reiterate, one that will live through time like the best stories ever told to man.","May 18, 2018"
1758411,Lisa,"There is always more to Orhan Pamuk than the words on the page, and The Red-Haired Woman is no exception. Nominated for the EBRD Prize for Translation, at 250-odd pages it is shorter than his recent novels but equally thought-provoking. Turkish politics isn’t often on my radar, but even I have noted with some dismay that recent elections have seen Turkey abandon some key aspects of democracy in favour of more authoritarian conservative rule. The Red-Haired Woman uses a provocative study of father-son relationships to show how sons (symbolising democracy in Turkey) can only learn to be themselves, when they resist the power of their fathers (symbolising autocratic government).. Ancient story-telling underpins the novel. There is the Persian epic, the Shahnameh which features Rostam and Sohrab, the father killing the child, and then there is (thanks to Freud) the more famous Oedipus of Sophocles, the son killing the father. The central character, Cem, who narrates most of the novel, becomes obsessed by these stories because of events in his own life, and in adulthood he trawls the great art museums of the world looking for works of art which depict these immortal stories.. Like all educated Turks of my father’s generation, what I really hoped to find on these trips wandering the shops, the cinemas, and the museums of the Western world was an idea, an object, a painting – anything at all – that might transform and illuminate my own life. (p.156). Cem is disappointed to find that depictions of Oedipus don’t focus on the moment when he kills his father but instead on when he solved the riddle of the Sphinx, as in Oedipus and the Sphinx painted by Ingres and also by Gustave Moreau. But in Moscow’s Tretyakov Gallery, he is utterly absorbed by a 19th century painting by the Russian artist Ilya Repin, depicting the moment when Ivan the Terrible kills his son in ways familiar to him from ancient Persian representations of Rostam and Sohrab..

42762513,Nidhi Mahesh,"It is my solmenest desire to visit Turkey, especially Istanbul, all because Organ Pamuk has infused such a concoction of myth and reality about the place that it times feels a magical creation of the author himself. I want to see, touch and feel and savour the flavour of this magic potion, yet I am afraid to probe deeper, lest the magical spell is broken!. Coming to Red Haired Woman, it is an intricate tale of filial bond, or lack of it. The interwoven myths and legends and their seamless connect to the modern day tale is fascinating. The characters are built step by step. You empathise with them, grow with them, worry for them and are both equally remorseful and relieved for them. The book reveals different perspective with each reading. In my first read I was rooting for Cem, who longed for a father and for a son. I would walk with him as he roamed the streets Ongoren, I waited for him to get a glimpse of the red haired woman and then to watch her perform. I would worry for him when the accident happen and wish for him to get away from it. I could travel to Tehran and the other European museums he visited to seek out Shahname and Sophocles's Oedipus the King. And I would feel his restlessness towards the end feel remorseful for the way his tale culminates.. But in this second reading I was more engrossed with the women characters. Gulichan, the red haired woman and Ayse are complete opposite in their persona. One a strong willed, spirited woman who sets the terms and forges the course of the narrative, the other an otherwise submissive character devoted to the companionship of her husband, seeking his quest, nurturing his dreams, building his business, remaining in shadow of the male. It's her character that suffers the most yet you don't see her pain, her loss is not shown.. As for the plot, it is not much of a mystery the myths and legends set the premise well enough. You, in a way, know where the tale is headed and who is going to play what role. What is interesting is the process - the way the tale is weaved.. Orhan Pamuk is no doubt a master storyteller, but we must also appreciate Ekin Oklap for the beautiful translation.","Feb 21, 2020"
12737918,Catherine,"Art imitates life. Life imitates art.. Part one is an unconventional introduction to father-son relationship and myths as old as the world - son killing his father, and father killing his son. Part two explores these myths and introduces us to our character's life as a successful businessman whose worries are the guilt he carries from his youth, and the fact that he cannot have children with his wife. Part three is a form of epilogue, conclusion written by the red-haired woman.. More than pointing out just parallels between art and life, the novel deals with the real subject of the Oedipus' myth - self-fulfilling prophecy. Main character's obsession with two myths dealing with patricide and filicide and attempt to clear his conscience and diminish the guilt he's carrying for not assisting his father-figure ultimately lead him to fall into same traps as the characters he spent years studying.. Another interesting detail is the role of red-haired woman. In a way, she represents and announces modern times arriving to conservative society (starting with her hair colour, career choice and unconventional relationship with her son); at the same time she is presented as a woman who can only cry over actions of her male family members, thus giving us a portrayal of her role in patriarchal society as seen by patriarchal society. Final part, her own story, events seen from her perspective, can also be seen as chorus in Greek tragedies.. While style and images created in this novel are the usual amazing Orhan Pamuk's style, this novel was completely different than his other novels I've read (Snow, My Name Is Red, Silent House, The Black Book, Museum of Innocence) and it was a very pleasant surprise. The combination of modern story and connection to ancient myths in a form loosely based on Greek tragedy really made this a great read. This was a great choice to complete my 2017 reading challenge.","Dec 17, 2017"
92006094,Halima,"This is my first Pamuk.. He writes with an effortlessly buttery flow, skilfully weaving layers of complexity into most of the characters. It is the mark of a good writer to be able to evoke emotions on behalf of characters and Pamuk is certainly amply capable in that regard. I particularly loved the way the book changed pace halfway through. Up until chapter 21 (out of 45), we follow Cem, a boy of 16 from Beşiktaş, a district of Istanbul. He takes an apprenticeship with a well digger, in nearby Öngören and for a month we follow this journey. The pace at which the first half is delivered gives the reader the ability to develop some sympathy for the young man with an absentee father. His father had abandoned them for political activism and so our protagonist pours his longing for a father into Master Mahmut, the well-digger. Then suddenly, the pace of the story alters by way of an event (no spoilers don’t worry!) and then we whizz through 30 years in the second half of the book. The story is tied in with two ancient tales. One belonging to Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh, the tale of Sohrab and Rostum. The second belonging to Greek mythology, the story of Oedipus. Both stories interlinked in terms of the father-son relationship (the key theme of Orhan’s novel). Stories that revolve around filicide (a father killing his son) and patricide (a son killing his father), respectively. And in both stories as recounted in Orhan’s novel, neither father nor son know that they are father and son. Particularly interesting to read a book centred around the importance of the father-son relationship and how development can be affected both with and without the patriarchal figure in the picture •. •. It was not a life changing piece of literature for me but it’s a very well written piece of fiction, I can’t deny that! And I do think I have yet to read my favourite Pamuk and I do intend to read more by him after this one.","Jan 16, 2020"
5603048,Jeruen,"Boy, this was a spectacular slow burn.. It started as ""meh"", with me scratching my head and wondering whether I'd eventually find this book interesting. But it slowly picked up, and I found myself eventually on the edge of my seat as it steadily became a page-turner. And yes, the ending was theatrical, and gave me the feeling that I should start the book all over again.. Essentially, this novel is a psychological study about father-son relationships, not mind you, not the ""normal"" type. It is essentially a recasting of the Oedipal myth, parallel with the story of Rostam and Sohrab from the. Shahnameh. . This book contrasts Sophocles' Western perspective of patricide, with Ferdowsi's Eastern take of filicide. And somehow, for the main characters of this novel, life imitates art. Pamuk has taken essentially one storyline and made it complex, bringing it out of either Thebes or Iran and into modern day Turkey.. Pamuk, who in his other novels, has appeared as a character, does not do so in this one. Rather, his characters are inter-connected by a web of complex relationships. Parallelisms abound: Cem's father was absent throughout his childhood, and so was Cem from the perspective of his son, Enver. Master Mahmut became Cem's surrogate father, and afterwards, he was also Enver's stand-in for a father figure. Aside from that, the book also explores ideological contrasts, such as West vs. East, religion vs. secularism, authoritarianism vs. individuality. And of course, there is the mythical belief of red-haired women as the harbinger of evil.. Overall, I must say I enjoyed this book, much more than I expected. I would give it 5 out of 5 stars. I definitely recommend this as an accessible book if one is interested in Orhan Pamuk's works.. See my other book reviews. here. .","May 10, 2020"
43401563,Velislava,"This novel begins incredibly slow, and barely speeds up about two thirds in. The ending was much quicker, though it did not feel rushed. What kept me reading through these slower-paced parts was the author's eloquence in presenting the emotions and moral dilemmas of the main character. Orhan Pamuk's vocabulary is rich, yet he does not burst into long descriptive paragraphs. Instead he uses his words almost sparingly, picking out a couple which precisely convey his intentions to the reader. I greatly admire this restraint, and wish more authors took the time to edit and polish their novels before releasing them. In my view, this is the book's strongest point.. Plot and character-wise, the novel was also engaging, each character felt tangible and real, the flow of events - natural, though not easily predictable. I wasn't overly keen on the culmination, as replaying those ancient myths (you will know which when you start reading) felt a little forced. The final revelations posed the question, 'Who is actually telling this story?', a pretty unusual question to ask oneself at the end of a novel.. As the book captures the entire life of the main character, we witness to the changes which come over Istanbul in a matter of decades, as well as how people cope with them. These changes run parallel in all big cities, but it is the main character's somewhat detached outlook which provides an intriguing birds eye perspective on modernisation.. Overall, I would have probably given the book three stars based on the story, theme and settings, the fourth star is purely for the beautiful language used, which is a joy in itself. I will certainly pick other of Pamuk's books based on what I read within The Red-Haired Woman.","Jun 04, 2019"
28265907,EJ,"It’s not so often we meet books that haunts our intellect. The Red Haired Woman turns out to be nothing less than a new version of what we call the Pamuk-artistry. Unlike his previous works, the novel does not emanate any lyrical thunderstorms which would at times make dry our throats nor so naïve. But, there is a magic in this books whose beguiling way of narration keeps the reader close to its until the last page. Divided into subtle chapters, the narrative reveals before us a racy modern thriller classic, which gets on more intriguing sentence after sentence. An ebullient tale which is abundantly rich in the medley of its themes that resiliently sways to and fro through the ages of myths and modernity, that shows how tales of old age still haunts and controls the psyche of modern man. After all, are we the reincarnations of myths or did the myths tried expose the inability of human psyche to profuse itself to limited versions among the unfathomable number of its breed which defines itself to be unique in substance and form? If so how can we blame Sohrab and Oedipus, Sophocles and Ferdowsi, Freud and Jung? (That’s how thought provoking the novel is).. A ruminative and politically rich novel, in which ancient myths to Pamuk’s own childhood curiosity of a ‘double’ living somewhere in the vast in the city and the agony of ‘political exile and estrangement from motherland’ had inflicted upon him, dances. Apart from Dostoevsky whom we so often feel in his novels, this time enters Sophocles, Ferdowsi and Freud sparkling all thru the structure and mindset of the narrative. You will never guess the twists and turns, you will never find the end; it’s a magical loop.","Sep 21, 2017"
1457001,Stephen Durrant,"Nobel-prize-winning author Orhan Pamuk’s latest novel, The Red-Haired Woman, has received mixed reviews (compare, for example, the Guardian and the Washington Post reviews). One criticism of Pamuk’s work is its often heavy-handed use of myth and symbol, in this case the story of Oedipus and the Shahnameh tale of Rostam and Sohrab, both concerning unwitting violence between fathers and sons. Okay, I was taken in. Yes, Pamuk does sometimes go overboard in reminding the reader of his central themes and of other literary texts hovering behind his stories, but I found this particular novel both engaging and powerful. And, let’s face it, sometimes the duller reader, of which I am perhaps one, needs a few prompts along the way! At any rate, two questions kept coming back to me as I read The Red-Haired Woman. First, who are our real fathers anyway, the one who sires us or those who play genuinely fatherly roles in our lives? The protagonist Cem’s “real” father is a shadowy figure whose devotion is to left-wing politics much more than to his son, while the well-digger Mahmut, a symbol of an older Turkey, become Cem’s primary father figure. Hence, the Oedipus theme in this novel centers upon the latter, but here the son recognizes his victim, he just doesn’t know whether or not he actually killed him! Second, is the past ever truly past? An event long buried can resurface at any moment with devastating results . . . especially if we have kept it secret from those we love most. The Red-Haired Woman, besides engaging such issues, also says much about modern-day Turkey and the conflicting forces that are straining its fabric. Actually, I could hardly put this novel down.","Nov 12, 2017"
18705909,Deepa Nair,"A mediocre read when juxtaposed with his other works. He has meticulously laboured to latch on fiction to fact and myth to life. The leitmotifs of Oedipus and Sohram were so consciously/ unconsciously recurrent in the form of literature and art during the evolving storyboard in such a way that the plot of the novel seemed to have been given away early on the read. I could surmise an element of filicide/ patricide pretty early on thus dispensing with tenseness of the nervewracking encounter at the pinnacle. The plot has been woven mellowly and the task of comprehension was undemanding. He is judicious enough in not stretching the point beyond what is called for and lending some air of cogency without any histrionic miasma.. Commonly encountered in his works, here too, he has touched upon and made room for no less than a few classical paintings, that might give some food for thought and whet the appetite of art dilettantes. The neoclassical painting, 'Oedipus and the Sphinx' by Ingres and by Gustave, 'Ivan the Terrible and his son' by the famous Russian painter, Illya Repin analogical to Rostam at Sohrab's deathbed, could stoke interest in exploring them more.. What captivated me most is the epigraph from 'Shahnameh', an epic by the Iranian poet Ferdowsi Tusi containing the mythical tale of a hero Rostam who inadvertently killed his son Sohrab- one from the Persian folktales which I had read as a child, which cropped up from my foggy memory and which would appeal to the sensibility of anyone passionate about Arabian and Persian folk tales.. “ As a fatherless son, so a sonless father will be embraced by none”- Ferdowsi, Shahnameh.","Nov 14, 2017"
1977854,CarolineFromConcord,"I know this Nobel winner's novel is a good book and that he is a gifted writer, but it was too painful to read. Every few pages I felt so much dread I had to put it down or read ahead to steel myself against what might be coming.. This is a story of a boy in Turkey who, abandoned by his father, becomes close to a well-digger on a summer job. The youth is a voracious reader who once worked in a bookstore, and he is obsessed with the tale of Oedipus (son unknowingly kills father, beds mother) and the Persian tale of Rostum and Sohrab (father kills son by accident).. In both legends, mysterious psychological urges force the inevitable, and the reader senses that the modern-day protagonist will not escape the power of myth to shape the future. The legends make the youth assume that something has happened that has in fact not happened -- thereby causing all his ensuing problems. In a similar way, Oedipus thought he could outrun the prediction of the oracle and the will of the gods. The only question here is how it will all play out.. Although the book is about fathers and sons, the title suggests the importance of women in stories that seem to be about men. Was Jocasta in the Oedipus story somehow behind the tragedy? How about the mother of Sohrab? By book's end, we get a fuller portrait of the red-haired woman but also new questions. Is she telling the truth?. The depiction of Turkey's emergence into the modern world was really well done, but I can't recommend this exercise in anxiety.","Nov 16, 2017"
17728700,Alan Mills,"This is a book in three basic parts.. Part One follows the narrator for a few months in his late teens: his middle class revolutionary father has abandoned the family, leaving them broke, just as the son is about to enter college. He becomes an apprentice to a well digger (side note, this is 1980’s in Turkey—demonstrating just how privileged we in the US are: they are still digging wells by hand), where he becomes infatuated with a red haired woman 10 years his senior. This is by far the best part of the book.. Part two follows the narrator overt he next 30 years, as he buries his memories of well digging, and becomes a successful real estate developer, until he decides to return to the site of his well, and his infatuation with the red haired woman. This section is ok, but until the end feels like it is just wasting time while we wait to see what happens when he finally returns—which is foreshadowed over and over.. Part Three switches perspective and tells the same story from the perspective of the red haired woman. However, this part is so short and superficial that it just doesn’t work. We find out very little about her or her life that it is really just a mechanism for filling in details of the narrative which in the end don’t really matter much.. I would give the first part five stars, with declining ratings for each of the subsequent sections.. The entire story is clearly intended as a retelling of Oedipus, which is referred to repeatedly in the story—there is nothing subtle about it.","Feb 19, 2018"

Parallel to this tale , there is frequent mention on ancient tales, the old story about Oedipus, in which son kills father and the Persian story of Rostam and Sohrab in which father kills his son. The story in the book largely talks about father and son relationship and Cem's obsession with these age old myths.. The story is on similar lines with Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Marakami. The modern retelling of Oedipus myths. Same myths but completely different story and very different narration, yet equally captivating. May not be the good choice as a first read by Orhan Pamuk, as in no doubt the author is one of the best. I would love to read other works by the author","Mar 31, 2020"
1765761,Michelle,"This was an OK read... I found it tediously descriptive in some areas.. Cem is a teenager in Istanbul whose father is basically missing from his life either because he is in and out of jail as a political prisoner or because he at one point, abandons his family.. Cem becomes the apprentice of a well digger, Master Mahmet on the outskirts of town where once the well is dug, a local business owner will start a textile mill.. Mahmet becomes a father figure to Cem as they toil day in and out to find water deep beneath the surface. Meanwhile, Cem becomes captivated by an older woman with red hair... a women whom he has his first sexual encounter.. Things go badly soon after the sexual encounter and Cem flees after leaving his mentor trapped at the bottom of the well.. Fast forward, Cem marries and he and his wife build a successful construction and real estate business until one day when he comes face to face with his past.. The story is a riff on Odepius, as well as, the story of Rostam and Sohrab... so if you know either of these stories, you will understand some of the ideas that drive the plot. However, the author was tedious in the amount of pages he devotes to weaving the themes from those stories into this plot line... I wanted to say... I get it, I get it.. Fathers and sons, mothers and sons... complicated relationships that can define us whether the relation is positive or troubled. What happens when you long for different parents than who gave you birth? How do you deal the with unintended consequences of your lies and actions? All things to pondrr. #chellelynnreads","Aug 02, 2020"
8146550,Mish Middelmann,"There is a lot of deep gazing at stars in this book, man and boy sitting by the fire at night, with depth and space to dream. I feel as if I was there as they dug the well, hoisted each bucket of sand and stone and poured each collar of concrete as the well got deeper.. Along with this cool and dreamy energy, there is a dramatic - even melodramatic - story of love and death that examines and re-examines, tells and re-tells the archetypal oedipal stories from Greek myth and from the Koran. The quickening of the blood that happens so fast and with such devastating consequences amongst men, between fathers and sons, and between men and women.. And the context of the story gave me fascinating insight into Turkey's position in the globe, the impacts of Christianity and Islam, the coiled spring of growth energy that was Istanbul in the 1980s.. As all this went on, I was deeply stirred by Pamuk's exploration of the different kinds of centrality of men and women in the world. The men in the drama are driven by fierce impulsiveness, anger and passion. The Red-Haired Woman is deeply connected with the source of life and emotion, and convoluted in the way she tangles up the lives of men. I felt that Pamuk did a great job of illuminating the way that both men and women take their own ways as natural and normal and the way they simultaneously love and hate the presence and the ways of the other.","Jan 12, 2018"
76836364,Marg Strein,"The Red Haired Woman Orphan Pamuk. Good book to read. Setting is Turkey. Tale of new, old traditional, and 21st century views. The book is marked with distortions of life and how we preceive events and people. We all strive for self awareness, actualization, wealth, happiness and security. It is how we acheive these goals which matter and maybe at times do not matter.. Is it ture Karma wins in the end or rules our destiny? Cem was obsessed with Oedipus Rex and one particular native myth. He studied the myths throughout his adult life with his wife --seeking to find truth or answers to the past. Did Cem wish to die for his past errors, decisions and judgements? Despite learning that Mahmut (his mentor) lived following the well incident (when Cem left him for dead to return home), he torments himself and places himself in great danger by returning to the site of the well years later. When he was 16 he was a well apprentice and one day he left Mahmut at the bottlom of the well. He did not return with help to pull his mentor out or to check if he was alive. But unexptectedly (years later), we learn Mahmut did survive and was pulled to safety by the red-haired woman.. Why would Cem put himself in danger and at risk of dying by the hands of his son Ever (red-haired woman's son) when he knew he had everything to live for (a wife, wealth, fame, security and a future). I believe Cem was obsessed and this obsession led to his untimely destruction and death.","Dec 01, 2019"
9295930,Debby,"Most of the book has the Orhan Pamuk style that I like ,but there was something disappointing for me compared to all the previous books .The first chapter was gripping and promising ,then starts all the issues of Oedipus and Shehname (the story of Rustem and Suhrab ) that spoiled the simple story telling flow . It seemed to me like the author wanted to write an essay on this subject and planted this in the book using the above two to touch on ""father and son "" , ""fable and reality"" , ""modern and the old "" , ""lost values and the modern world views "" and on the on going human tragedies . I found it a bit forced on me . Same as name dropping of other books during the whole story .. I think this novel could have been more powerful with out all this ""digging "" into these two epics .I also felt a hurry to finish of the story and connect all loose ends at the last chapter .Still here too are few gems as the love between mother and son descriptions .. The ever changing Istanbul theme ,the old lost professions ,the political issues are there that puts the Orhan Pamuk stamp. I took a challenge and read the book in Turkish ,yet I also have a nagging feeling that this book was more likely addressed to foreign language readers and would be even more powerful in the English translation .","Oct 20, 2017"
12991256,Andrei Udrea,"The book represents my first contact with Orhan Pamuk and it is unfortunately a huge deception, as I had great expectations. I will, however, not give up and give another try to one of his novels, but I will definitely not recommend this to someone new to his writings.. The book is constructed around the parental relation between father and son, which is unequivocally announced straight from the first page. The recurrent reference to the corresponding Greek and Persian mythology which the author uses throughout the book, turns up from being redundant to just annoying with its unsubtle symbolism. In fact, my main problem with the book relies exactly on its lack of subtlety and lack of reader involvement. At some point, the author even explains through one of his characters the parallel between legend and reality, as if it wasn't obvious enough. Other similarities and allegories are explained as well.. The writing style is typical for an easy reading book, without complicated constructions or elevated metaphors and scratches only the surface of some interesting ideas with a whole lot more potential. The redeeming twist after the first part of the book, which is dragging in a tiresome way, could have been better exploited (see Dostoievski for that matter). Some other twists of the story either feel clumsy or are predictable.. To sum up, it is a shallow book based on a solid complex topic, which has an obvious mainstream target audience. I am not included.","Aug 13, 2018"
3821867,Eric Sutton,"I read Pamuk's novel Snow a few years ago and have thought about it often since. I remember being captivated by its ethereal, otherworldly quality. It drew me to Pamuk's power as a novelist, his ability to write of the local with global exigency. The Red-Haired Woman, while not as impactful as Snow, is just as intriguing, and no different in terms of Pamuk's dialectical and commingling themes: East and West, Traditional and Modern, Religious and Secular, Capitalist and Marxist. Can the two ever successfully integrate? Not likely or often, but the tension makes for good reading. Pamuk also explores the role of fatherhood in this novel. The stories of Oedipus and Rostam and Sohrab weave throughout the narrative and inform the relationships of Cem, the main character, with his real and surrogate fathers as well as with his own son, who emerges late in the novel. The story then becomes somewhat of a mysterious fable, and the relative simplicity of the prose masks a wealth of questions and coincidences to ponder. Pamuk has created an unlikely, 21st century tragic hero in Cem, one whose follies play out with rich tragic irony for the reader. A novel of mystique, and an homage to a faded time, place, and storytelling tradition.","Dec 04, 2017"
76812901,Lucy Fisher,"This contains some spoilers! The blurb on the back of my edition describes this as a fable of fathers and sons, and this novel really does hold true to that. I found the first half, which provides the core of the narrative which the rest of the novel reflects on, particularly enjoyable. The middle section, in which Cem and his wife Ayse traverse museums looking for versions of the Oedipus Rex and Shahnameh works which both become obsessed by, in Cem's case after having lived out a version of these stories in the first part, I found a little less satisfying: a step down in pace, and out of the fable-like atmosphere of the first section. However, this was probably necessary for Pamuk to make us reflect on the action in the light of this narrative tradition of father-son drama. It feels a bit laboured at times, but intentionally so. Whatever the case, Cem's return to the scene of his crime and its inevitable resolution is gripping, and the Red-Haired Woman finally taking over the narrative at the end is quite a satisfying conclusion. All in all, having read The Museum of Innocence, in which I felt Pamuk had a bit of a tendency to over-intellectualize and bog down the narrative at times, I opened this with a bit of trepidation, but need not have feared, this was great storytelling.","Feb 28, 2018"
56972839,Gabriela Galescu,"The well-digger stands for the close-to-nature, tradition rich Turkey. The main character, a teenager dreaming of becoming a writer, is the apprentice of the well-digger who also becomes a father figure for the young man. The mythological ""killing of the father"" frees the teenager to give up on his dreams and become a very successful property developer, part of the evil empire of modernization at the cost of environment and tradition. Unsurprisingly, the now middle aged ex-well-digger's apprentice is killed by his own son who lives in a contemporary universe of traditional values (religiosity and the writing of religious poetry). Not a bad framework, but at one point the book loses steam.. I found the first part, the apprenticeship and first love, very poetic and in full command of cinematographic depictions of landscape, villages and people. The second part reads more like a tabloid rendition of the life of the rich. I would not be surprised if the author did that on purpose: of course that well-digging and first love are more authentic than making money and spending it. But this writing trick (if that is it) did not really work for me.","Oct 08, 2017"
962663,Karen,"I have read 2 or 3 of Pamuk's previous books and enjoyed them. This, however, I couldn't finish. I read the first 50 pages and the last 50 pages.. It's a coming of age story, and I felt as though the female characters were very flat. The men focus on women as caregivers and sex objects, and many the men abandon women and children. There is a lot of father-son tension (and surrogate father/ surrogate son tension). And there are a lot of allusions to Oedipus Rex. I just don't have time for such sexism and narcissism. And I feel as though this is a narrative that has been told ad nauseum.. BLARGH.. SPOILERS:. The story starts with a young man who is alienated from his own father, who is a philanderer and a disappears after criticizing the Turkish government. The young man gets a job digging a well and is mentored by his boss. The young man then gets obsessed over a woman with red hair. It turns out that the father and son both had a sexual relationship with this woman. Lots of fathers are thought to be dead, or to be killed or to be not really killed, or to soon die, or to be killed but not on purpose. GAH.","Feb 22, 2018"
64806778,Jodie (whatjodiereads),"I enjoyed the storyline of this book, but it was very long winded and very serious, and I feel like there was a hidden message behind the storyline. I like books with a hidden message, but because I wasn’t 100% enjoying this book, I wasn’t interested in finding the message behind it. I think that this book was more about philosophy, rather than actually telling a story. I also can’t work out if this is based on a true story or not, so that’s another thing that’s annoying me about it because I want to know if it’s true or not. I did really enjoy the storyline and I found it very interesting. I also loved it because it’s set in Turkey, which is my favourite place. I really struggled to get into this book so it then took me a long time to read it, especially considering it only has 270 pages! Although I did struggle with this one, I have My Name Is Red by the same author on my TBR pile and I’m still planning on reading it. Overall I did enjoy this book and was shocked by some of the events that happened in it, but I do think that some parts were really dragged out and could have been written a bit better.","Jun 25, 2018"
5857584,Charlotte,"Starting to read The Red-Haired Woman by Orhan Pamuk was like meeting up with an old friend. I spent a wonderful 7 years living in Istanbul and reading books by Orhan Pamuk. I especially love his books that take place there, like this one. Hearing about places like Gebze, Beşiktaş, and Beykoz bring back lots of memories.. This is a story of fathers and sons. Akin and Cem, Master Mahmut and Cem, Rustem and Sohrab, Laius and Oedipus to name a few. The first two parts of the book are Cem's life and his experiences which revolve around the red-haired woman, a summer spent well digging, and his fascination with the stories of Oedipus and Rustem & Sohrab. The final part is from the red-haired woman's point of view.. I enjoyed the book immensely. Learning about well digging and just spending some time back in Istanbul. The writing was Pamuk's typical 'evening stroll' pace which folks seem to either love or loathe. The last book I read of his was the Museum of Innocence 9 years ago so I have a bit of catching up to do.","May 21, 2019"

I find it difficult to write a review as I struggled with it at times; it is very slow in places and didn’t seem to be getting anywhere. However, I persevered and I’m glad that I did.. Despite the title, the book is really about fathers and sons. There are several references to Oedipus and Shahnameh (a Persian epic poem that I had never heard of) both of which have a similar father/son theme.. The story is told in three parts. The first focuses mainly on Cem’s life as an apprentice well-digger, his fascination with the red-haired woman and the accident that has a profound affect on his life. The second covers his adult life, his marriage and career and the final part brings everything together.. As I said, I’m glad that I stayed with it but was not ‘wowed’ as many other readers clearly are!","Jun 14, 2019"
6874255,Yalman Onaran,"Another well written modern-day story with historical hues by the only Nobel laureate from Turkey. I actually read this one in English (the first time I've read an original Turkish novel in a different language) but Goodreads didn't seem to list the English translation, only the original. As is almost always the case with Orhan Pamuk, the story is very universal, very western, very human with only slight touches of Turkishness, which will make it even more adorable for the non-Turkish reader. I wouldn't say this is the best of his works (when he unusually dabbled in political matters in ""Snow"" he was more of a genius if you ask me), but it's a superb read nevertheless. I always think of Pamuk along with Ismail Kadare (Albanian) and Naguib Mahfouz (Egyptian) as the great storytellers from cultures we don't know much about but can easily relate to because of how they universalize the pains, the feelings, the thoughts, the contrasts. Well done once again Mr. Pamuk.","Oct 27, 2017"
5850177,Michael,"Pamuk does not disappoint as a storyteller!. “The Red-Haired Woman” is essentially a contemporary story of love and vengeance with its roots in the ancient myths of Sophocles’ ‘Oedipus Rex’ (patricide) and the legend of Rostam and Sohrab from Ferdowsi’s ‘Shahnameh’ (filicide). But as with many of his works, the underlying themes are the conflicts between modernity and the disappearing past, and secularism and Islamic tradition.. The novel is divided into 3 parts, with each corresponding to a main character in the symbolic Turkish Oedipus complex: in part one, Mahmut is the Islamic father figure, and in part two, Cem is the secular son. It is in part three, narrated by Gülcihan, the red-haired woman that Pamuk’s artistry shines; the novel becomes a noir thriller with the loose threads of the earlier narratives tightly tied together and revealing to us a surprising new perspective on the events of the novel.","Jan 13, 2018"
1037274,Doria,"“It should be as credible as a true story, and as familiar as a myth.”. With these words, Orhan Pamuk’s eponymous Red-Haired Woman neatly describes his novel. I enjoyed it tremendously, although it took a little time before I felt myself truly immersed in its topography of dusty, forgotten towns and soulful men fighting against their own yearnings. At around a third of the way in, I was hooked, and could hardly tear myself away.. Beautifully written, cleverly paced, building expectation and suspense, Pamuk creates a smooth veneer of quotidian commonplaces - days of digging, traffic-filled commutes, business lunches - beneath which roils a substrata of mythic proportions, threatening to erupt into the daily life of his main character at any moment. When the crisis finally comes, it comes as almost a relief, although it does not, as we might have expected, signal the end of the story. Not until everyone has their say does the novel draw to its close.","Jan 21, 2018"

The poetic tale of a Turkish Teenager's journey of life where he encounters various people who make his life possible and miserable is a poignant beauty to read. . The Haunting effect this leaves on you is impressive and mesmerising.. The Classic Stories of Rostum, Where the Father kills the Son accidently and Oedipus, where the Son kills his father and sleeps with his mother appear throughout the book becoming an obsession for both the protognist andd, us the readers. We are made to wonder the effects these stories weave on Cem (the Protagonist) and cautiously on Us.. The book in itself starting from the cover is memory to cherish. The moment you have your book in hand and start caressing the cover, Your hand grazing over the red hair of the woman, you realize the urge to find more on this woman. Thus starts the beautiful mystery and I felt the cover almost kept reminding you of the woman to move along the Story. The depiction of the places and the characters is a bliss in itself..

Right from the beginning I was really pulled into the narrative and I truly felt like I lived the story in the first part of the book. The entire process of choosing a place to dig the well and the laborious process thereafter wasn't something that was just skimped through in this book or written in a tedious manner that makes you want to skip through the parts, it was written in a way where I felt that I was there right next to them, digging way and toiling under the sun.

I typically read for escape so my critical analysis skills are often blunted. That said, it bubbled up many questions for me regarding my relationship with my parents and my own child. It left me feeling that, in the end, victims and malefactors, are nothing moire than facets of the same gem reflecting light as you turn it and that what is seen as fate is often a continuation of inaction or cowardice to enact change..

The way in which he left Ongoren was surprising for me, and everything that came afterwards was like a breath of fresh air compared to other books I've read recently. Pamuk's style is smooth and organized.. Even if I didn't really identify with neither Rostam's story, nor Oedip's story, since I am a girl and have no children, the way in which they were presented and how they influenced Cem's life was fascinating and really kept me going.

'The red haired woman' was one of them. Also, to my surprise, it was available at half price so I bought it instantly.. When I get the book,there was a review written on the last page 'When you will reach the end, you will want to read this book again'. That review stayed with me.

This covers some of the same social and urban upheavals described in 'A Strangeness in my Mind', but from the perspective of an urbanite, and ultimately of one of the wealthy construction barons making their fortune from the mass importation of people into the realm of Istanbul..

But just like in most of the other books, it's very readable. Not as impactful as My name if Red, I am left with the feeling that it could have been a significantly more powerful book if only the feeling of guilt had been exploited a bit more. The end of the book left me a bit dissatisfied as I stopped caring the moment the main character found out what happened to Master Mahmut..

The weaving of myth with melodrama, history with biography and fantasy with the everyday is often impeccable, but not flawless.. I was particularly impressed with how easily the central character justified himself after, literally, getting away with murder (or so he believed). With little more than a few pangs of guilt, he is able to build his life having taken away another's.. The division of the book into three parts allows different timescales to be carefully stretched and compressed to full effect. Perhaps its greatest stroke of narrative trickery is bringing in an extra voice to reveal the denouement. Here Pamuk shows his true storytelling mastery.","Jul 07, 2020"

Very likely that I'm going to read the Oedipus and Shahnameh after being elaborately introduced, in an unexpected perspective I would say.. *spoiler alert*. I, however, disliked the ending while reading it. I think it would have a greater impact if either the father killed the son with intention, or the son killed the father. The accident element was too predictable, but also justified. How? In the myths, the father did not kill his son knowing he was killing his son, nor the other way around. The events took place because fate brought them in these situations and thus making the stories so tragic. So, I understand the accident element, but it lacked the tragedy touch like in the myths.","Mar 11, 2018"

The newest novel (Turkish published in 2016, English 2017) about father-son relationships, or rather about lacking one, with mysticism of old fables, turned into a mystery with almost a crime-story twist. When you think you know how it’s gonna end and you’re proven wrong. There was just a short part which I though was a bit lengthy and not bringing much development to the story (hence one star less), but actually the plot is gaining speed with advancing the pages and was making me more and more curious what the closure to all of it is going to be.. A subtle picture of Turkish customs and social rules engraved in the plot. Looking forward to read more of his books!","Apr 16, 2018"
28973372,Enid Wray,"A lovely quick little read but, sadly, unfulfilling. This has also been sitting, waiting, to be read for quite some time. Perhaps too much anticipation?. A lovely evocation of Turkey at the time, the first part of the book, told by the young Cem, draws you into the story. Sadly, this interest, on the part of the reader, wanes in the later sections as the narration becomes very uneven, even heavy handed.. Most annoyingly, there are only so many times I need to be told the stories of Oedipus and Shahnameh. I get it. Let the story tell me. No need to beat me over the head with it!. Then there is the contrivance - the only word I have for it - that is the ‘twist’ at the end. Really? This is just all too trite and horribly predictable.","Dec 29, 2018"
4458927,RMD,"Simple story - in fact, a modern adaptation of a classic - or let's say two. Where issues of father/son converge.. It's one of those where you hear the voice of the main character for so long, it becomes increasingly frustrating when the climax occurs and the main character just fumbles it all up, just turning it into another self-fulfilling prophecy.. Character development is okay, you can feel quite a few characters, but they're all feeling pretty inconsequential about the grand scheme of things - and even their own stories. So essentially you just see them play their parts. The rich people don't seem to realise how their actions affect the wider world - and the activists don't seem to really do much either.. Really not that much to take away.","Jan 03, 2019"
7793612,Prathap,"Combining elements of the Greek tragedy Oedipus by Sophocles and the tale of Rostam and Sohrab from the Persian epic Shahnameh, Pamuk weaves an enchanting narrative in The Red-Haired Woman set in modern day Turkey. Part tale of human foibles and part commentary of Turkey's political landscape, Pamuk's writing is a window into Turkish society. Set in Istanbul, the book follows the teenager protagonist who is apprenticing with a well-digger. Nothing more could be said about the plot, without revealing the twists, hence I'll refrain from it. Nearly 300 pages of delightfully restrained prose with not one moment of overwrought melodrama, although the story has all the traps, The Red-Haired Woman is proof why Pamuk is a master of modern fables. Quite a satisfactory read.","Jun 06, 2019"
14506772,Zeinab,"Romantic-criminal novel I would say... my first turkish-author book. It starts very slow... the first few chapters was very boring. At some point I put the book aside and waited for Xmas to finish it. It got very excited in the latest chapter, like I couldn't put the book aside :). I'm very pleased to have a chance to read this book, now I'm happy and satisfied. I wish the story wasn't started so boring in the first chapters and the last chapters could have been longer with more details.. A remained question, The main character knew about Rostam-Sohrab and how terrifying could be the relationship between the son and his unknown father! Why he took that risk and went to visit the well with a stranger appointed by the mother-of-his-never-seen-son?! I think in reality no one take that risk!","Jan 17, 2020"
14865299,Ann Weisz,3 and a half stars. The style of writing captivated me as well as the storyline . A young 16 year old boy from Istanbul starts working as a well digger and develops a father son relationship with his employer/ “ master” as well as becomes infatuated with an older woman with red hair that he encounters. I am not a fan of myths or fables and this book centres around 1 Greek and 1 Turkish fable depicting patricide and filicide but I enjoyed the nuances. I felt the last part of the book disappointing - it felt too rushed as if the author wanted to put all the puzzle pieces together but didn’t quite reach resolution. I would like to read other books by this author though as I see he won a Nobel Literature prize ( not for this book though),"Aug 13, 2020"
51838041,Jeff Kaye,"This was a book on many levels - morally, physically and as a story. A story of wells that are dug deep into the soil, extracting the animal life of millions of years ago; of historical figures like Oedipus where sons kill fathers and fathers kill sons; of the deep relationship between sons and fathers and sons and mothers and husbands and wives; of the traditional Otterman Turks and those of a secular persuasion; of the the theatrical and poetic and the land-hungry moneymen that seek their fortune.. So many stories strung together over one thread - Cem and the Red-haired Woman.. Fascinating, deep-seated yet easy to read.","Mar 12, 2018"

This is one of the first of Oprah’s writing that I picked and I completely devoured it..I could connect to his writing, his story telling and way he describes the inner turmoil... I don’t know what kind of genre I would fit this in but it’s what I have started enjoying reading off late..I am not much of a book reviewer here but I just loved how the story unfolds and ties back in the end..it’s a masterpiece for me and I am so glad it moved me a bit away from my post Harry Potter syndrome..this book got me hooked finally!!

20537546,Wriju Ghosh,"A master storyteller. One must really appreciate how to keep the reader engaged on a story which is from completely different background and culture. I have read the translated version but I must say it was well translated. Though I found quite a lot 'd (They'd, We'd, He'd). At times it was hurting eyes.. 1. Mixing old ancient stories with modern backdrop. 2. Narrating in a first person in 2 chapters then moving another person's narration.. 3. Dealing with love and complex love which leads to complex relationships. The matter of the fact this is of 275 page book containing a many stories. Stories around us. Love and relationship.. A must read.","May 20, 2018"
7686959,Saheli,"The beginning and the theme of the book are very intriguing. The story especially -the first and second chapters are masterfully narrated by Pamuk. The characters -the well digger and the young apprentice, the bond between them, the allegory of Oedipus and Rustam and shorab created a tension between the protagonist and his son. The absence of real father and a search for the father like figure is a key theme in this story. Destiny played an important role in this novel too. But the story ended in the third chapter in hackneyed melodrama. But overall it is worth reading . Pamuk has his significant style throughout the book.","Jun 01, 2018"
2185693,Harvee,"The Red-Haired Woman by Orhan Pamuk was a lucky find at the library. I don't read enough books narrated by young men/teenagers and written by male authors. This is a literary novel about an adolescent falling in love and also dealing, well or not so well, with an uncomfortable working situation, well-digging in the countryside under a demanding and obsessed well digger. I've just now finished the book, a five star read definitely.. The writer is so good that his book made me begin to feel guilty too, as guilty as his young protagonist, although I had none of his experiences and did none of the things this young protagonist did.","Jun 24, 2018"
24385393,Frank DiPrimo,"Great, short read about a teen boy in Istanbul who goes away for a summer before going to University ( college) and works with a famous well-digger as an apprentice. The story focuses on his relationship with this man , the boy's father and a red-haired woman he sees in town and later meets, along with his later wife.. There is many references to the Oedipus story and Rotsam, a Turkish version where the reverse happens as the Father kills the son.. Not to the spoil the story or ending I will leave it at that, but good character development and sotry of guilt, love, finding ones self and family relationships and more.","Apr 24, 2019"
8897783,Guchu,"My first Pamuk and I really enjoyed it. It's told in 3 parts, the first part, about the mechanics of manual well digging was surprisingly my favorite. The second part drew onto the Oedipus Rex and the story Rostam and Sohrab from the Persian epic Shahnameh and we also get to see some of the political and cultural changes in Turkey in the 80s and 90s. Also pretty good.. The third part was the weakest, those times where an author is using a character to rapidly tie up hanging plot points and explain stuff instead of just...showing you.. Overall: An arresting story, very well written, high enjoyment value. I would recommend this.","Mar 29, 2020"
110953883,All About Greek,"This was my first actual encounter with Orhan Pamuk.. I will say two things: It has too long been since feeling that once finishing a book I really long to reread it and delve into its world of ideas and thoughts. The book captured my curiosity at its midst and in the final quarter it was so exciting and mesmerising that I could hardly stop reading it.. There are two aspects that some readers might not like: slow pace, not many actual events. But any reader who loves examining human psychology, mentality and personality will love it. I for one came to love Pamuk through this book. So happy I bought it! Thank you Orhan Pamuk!","Mar 29, 2020"

A terrible accident happens while working on the well, though, and the young man Cem flees. On his return years later, he learns just what happened as the result of the accident and just who the Red-Haired Woman is. As always, I'm looking forward to book club discussion to clear up an issue or two, but I did enjoy the book.","May 06, 2018"
6171472,Bharathi Rajeswaran,"Mysterious but linear, simple yet complex. It is Istanbul, Ongoren and its memories, Historic, Arts, musings and culture. when fables of Sohrab, Rostam and Oedipus run in parallel with life and is relevant in the life of men of at least 3 generations of the 20 th and the 21st Century, the impact the book makes is enormous. It creates a world of Istanbul inside your head and never allows you to come out of it. Over all it is beautiful. Only geniuses can write these stories this simple. And Orhan is one.","May 21, 2018"
49635284,Dolf van der Haven,"Pamuk's latest novel is fairly short compared to his previous ones. Its plot is therefore necessarily more linear and less epic. Even so, it is a good novel, with unexpected plot twists, as well as some that are too predictable. Opposing Sophocles' Oedipus Rex and Ferdowsi's Shahname (my favourite epic) with each other was a great find. The endong I found a bit fizzling out, even though it turned into something that felt creepy.. Next thing to read is logically Oedipus Rex (because I already read the Shahname).","Aug 25, 2018"
16328029,Flo,This is written in a stilted translation; also the series of coincidences that are important to this story made reading this new novel by Orhan Pamuk very difficult. I did not enjoy this one. Cem is a poor young boy living in Istanbul. He is forced to work during his school vacation and chooses to become assistant to a well digger who teaches him how to dig wells at a site outside of Istanbul. Cem however spies a beautiful red-haired woman who is an actress in a traveling theatre and thus begins his sexual awakening which later on will have repercussions in his life. Not his best effort.,"Oct 16, 2018"
6635584,Jeanne,"This book was certainly out of my usual reading range. In the Western world, our education does not normally include fables. So while I knew something about Oedipus, I'd never heard of Sohrab and Rostam. It seems that the author was spinning modern day morality tales out of ancient myths. And since I've never been to Turkey, I was interested in hearing more about its' history & politics. As another reviewer so aptly put it, this book educates while it entertains. Pamuk is an engaging storyteller and I'm beginning to enjoy different books that have been translated into English.","Oct 19, 2018"
86629979,J.Purkis,"Highly readable, engaging and occasionally enchanting reworking of Oedipus myths in a modernising Turkey. By halfway through the book, we see where it is going and yet this does not spoil the pleasure of the telling. At times it feels as though we are being a little 'led' and told what to think, and there are shades of Coehlo (but with more ideas and bite) but the writing style is just effortless and there are some interesting reflections on how unresolved matters of love can gnaw away at you over the years. I wanted to sample something by this author and it did the trick.","Jan 09, 2019"
81565090,ELAHEH,I loved the second part. I truly enjoyed reading how Pamuk was framing the narrator’s complexes somewhere between East and West (where exactly Istanbul is located and the narrator is from) through Persian and Greeks myths and legends. A modern Turkish identity is pretty much how Pamuk had described it. Eastern behaviours/traditions with Western judgments and Western behaviours with Eastern rejections. I hated the book from just the time he realises he had a son and the third part. I think he could’ve wrapped things up smarter than a cheap turkish TV series.,"Apr 14, 2019"
98174434,bexley,This is the first Orhan Pamuk novel that I have read . It was surprisingly easy to read and easy to follow(before reading the book I took a glimpse on the biography of this Turkish novelist to see what kind of book to expect). The story itself is not as important as the meaning behind it . We can eventually conclude the fact that Pamuk is trying to convey the fact that all things happen for a reason and that we cannot escape fate. This idea is relentlessly highlighted in different parts of the plot.,"Jun 05, 2019"
98490757,George Millership,"such a grasp of characters, relations, worlds, histories, generations, politics. I don't think I've read a book by pamuk that doesn't excel on everything you'd hope a book to.. poetic when it counts. so tight. incredible appropriation of eastern and western mythology, tied to physical labour and class tension. the great beauty of labour is illuminated, but doesn't shy away from its horror and violence of it either.. how a book should be written.. oddly put me in mind of cinema paradiso, but far darker.","Jun 17, 2019"
23939008,LindaMoctez,"What a book! Haunting from page 1 as we are introduced to the young every-boy of a Turkish village back during the military occupation. His simple narration is easily accessible to the reader but expresses fathoms of depth containing heartbreak, hope, misplaced need of revenge, sexual obsession, ambition and helplessness. Not only this, there are understated political depictions like a chorus in the background, coupled with eternal mythical tales expressing the upcoming destined tragedy.. A truly great book which brought Turkey to life, from almost its conception to the present day.","Jun 26, 2019"
29046294,John Tranchese,"I do believe that Pamuk makes the case for sensuality, eroticism while entertaining a classic construct. The action is conveyed across the board, first, second , third person which makes for the proponent Clems’ well rounder character development. We are basically influenced in the archetypal development of plot which again conforms to classic novel literature.. I believe this to be a slow read regardless the exciting turn of events that ensue climactically. I recommend wholeheartedly this book “not for the faint of heart.”","Nov 21, 2019"
29542811,Amrita Mukherjee,"The book started off well and the plot points are good but the way the characters meet each other and the story progressed is so random .. There is just unlimited repetition about the odepus complex and the only interesting part is about the protagonist and the well digger.. I think the story was okay but everyone has nothing to talk about except how sons kill their fathers or fathers kill their sons .It seems less like a story built on a concept,and more like a PHD thesis.😅😅. Some of the issues brought up are good about the leftist movement, and women's empowerment.","Jul 21, 2020"
41241918,Michael,"Excellently crafted with sensitively detailed personal recollections woven around two ancient myths, one Greek, one Persian. Enjoyable tale of love to read, requiring patience and curiosity into the author’s Turkish culture still torn by the pulls of the neoliberal West and its more ancient roots in Persia, with its current authoritarian ruler appealing to the large Muslim population that distrusts the secular influences initiated by Ataturk. Fascinating.","Mar 20, 2018"
6348232,Jason,"Started out great - a simple, almost magically realist story. Then it started with the heavy-handed symbolism. Then it started explaining the heavy-handed symbolism directly.

9146271,Nancy Cook  Lauer,"3/5 A novel about a fellow with some serious Daddy issues. The slight glimpses into Turkish country life and the parallels with other famous tales of Daddy issues helped keep me reading this book that at times seemed repetitive and slow-moving. That and the author won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006, so I was determined to make it through. I'm going to be charitable here and say something may have been lost in translation, but I'm not sure I will pick up another by this author.","Aug 05, 2018"
11550482,Nancy Ross,"This was intriguing, occasionally annoying, but never dull. I ended up admiring how the author, after plodding ever so slowly through the summer job of the protagonist as an apprentice well-digger, then telescoped the rest of the guy's life into a few short chapters with plot twists and point of view changes. A fascinating glimpse into the changes in Turkish society during the era of Westernization, flirtation with NATO and the EU, and subsequent Islamification.","Aug 27, 2018"
18091336,Akibsi,"This is not an easy read. I enjoyed learning about Shahnameh, Book of Kings, the Iranian epic poem that I had never heard of. The novel is divided in three parts. During the first at some point you wonder what is it all about, the second part introduces the conflict and it is then that the first part makes sense. The third part brings it all together. This is not a ""feel good"" lecture it was actually quite an uncomfortable read at some points. But it is definitely worth reading.","Sep 30, 2018"

Not half a star more because among other things, the ending felt like a cop out and in the end, I'm left feeling unsatisfied. Not to mention that I've grown up with Rostam and Sohrab and I've been to Turkey, and I don't think the book lives up to the magic of either.","Nov 03, 2018"

He offers us a drawing of the top of the well and, in this case, a picture is worth a thousand words. He also reviews the story of Oedipus with us, so no one reading this book is left behind. The Red-Haired Woman has the potential of being rather esoteric, but thanks to the author's sensitivity, everyone will enjoy reading it..","Nov 26, 2018"
89811826,Ashcuck,"This was the first book I have read from Pamuk, and frankly I am quite disappointed by how the story chose to conclude itself, The over-recurring theme that Orhan chose to exploit was the father/son relationships from old texts like Oedipus the King and Shahnameh, which are also relentelessly referenced in this book.

Maybe for Pamuk, being so much shorter than usual, it was. But in which case, he needed to take more care to be succinct. Oh, yes, that's me telling Orhan Pamuk how to write a novel. So I'll stop there!","Mar 23, 2019"

With each book I love even more these complex and passionate people.","Jun 10, 2019"

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I found my enjoyment of the main character to wane after a certain twist in the story, after that I went from enjoyment to reading to see how the story turned out. The threads tying the plot together, at the end, never quite made up for my lack of enjoyment of Cem. I can see many people enjoying it thoroughly though.","Dec 28, 2019"
27536075,Malvika Bhanti,This book is all about Life's occassional tendency to imitate myths and fables.

It was a very engrossing book and a very good read.,"Jan 03, 2020"
7631353,Aya,I have mixed feelings about this novel. I liked the integration of the tale of oedepius by sophocles and how he killed his own father and rostam kiling his son in ferdowsi’s book into the plot and how it affected the flow of events but also somehow the novel turned a bit cliche and the ending became predictable.. The language wasnt the best either which could be due to the translation and the pace of the novel was ok. overall i think its worth checking out,"Jan 04, 2020"

16973032,Sarah Privette,Rethinking my original review - In the middle of the #metoo movement it is strange to be reading about a statutory rape situation between an older woman and a teenage boy in which the whole drama around the age difference is discussed through the lens of the oedipus story. Who us the victim here? Too much of the story is spent painfully connecting the dots and over explaining the literary references. It should have been a long short story.,"Aug 19, 2018"
5110608,Parvathy,"Mythology underlies the story. Oedipus and Rostam/ Sohrab, patricide and filicide, all are references. The story of Cem (and his relationships with his father and his son), runs parallel to the myths.

Worth a read.","Dec 04, 2018"
1323536,Leah Adams,"I loved this book. Pamuk explores the relationship of fathers and sons, weaving the characters in the book with stories and myths, primarily the Greek story of Oedipus, and the Persian story of Rostam and Sohrab, with side trips to Abraham and Isaac. The book also explores the transition in Turkey, and particularly Istanbul, from traditional life to life in the 21st century.","Dec 15, 2018"

14717955,Adwaith Kallil,I have finished the book jus now. Its still lingering in my mind what i have read. The seeker of a old fairy tale becomes the victim of the same. I lile the free flowing writing. I couldn't I loved the book or not but it has given me some new areas of thoughts. I always like Orhan Pamuk writes. This one was not dfiiferent. I am not getting into specifics as it would give away the joy in reading.,"Jul 20, 2020"
17353987,Neha Bhomia,"An awesome read! Beautifully crafted story, which keeps you gripped and guessing till the end. The way the story has been linked to the classics is simple amazing.

43367989,Zita Szigeti,I was told not to read this book. I struggled with My Name Is Red (still couldn't get through...). So I was skeptical about this one. BUT I loved it! I loved how Pamuk wove the story so real life is connected to ancient myths. I loved the suspense. And I wanted to see a happy ending.. Brilliantly written.,"Aug 12, 2020"
7965722,Laura,"It's the 1st book I read written by Pamuk, it wasn't quite what I expected it, but it had its very good moments. I like the way he can tell a story - everything feels very natural and fluid. I didn't like this story too much, it was kind of predictible and in someways I felt I don't have enough layers revealed in order to really get his characters.","Aug 15, 2020"
41697439,Fidan Huseyni,"I have a bit of a love hate relationship with Pamuk’s books. His vivid storytelling never fails to take me to a parallel reality and I find myself engrossed in the lives of those he narrates.

597461,Elyse  Walters,"""The Museum of Innocence"", by Orhan Pamuk, was one of the most nail biting intense. stories of a wealthy man's obsession for a shopgirl in Istanbul I had ever read..... One hell of an amazing 600 page novel!!! Magnificent!. ""A Strangeness in my Mind"".... is also magnificent- brilliant - deliciously enjoyable. I lost myself through the eyes of Pamuks's protagonist seeking balance between the past and the present.. The story begins when an elopement goes wrong for Mevlut, a street vendor, living in Istanbul since the age of twelve. He returns to his native Anatolia to meet his beloved Rayiha. Arrangements have been made for them to run away together. Mevlut has glimpsed her just once, wearing a headscarf, at a wedding. Since then, he's written her hundreds of love letters - for three years - praising her beauty and eyes.. After making his getaway with his cousin, Suleyman driving, during the darkest of nights, Mevlut realizes his bride-to-be is actually the older homelier sister.. Being an honorable man, he makes peace with the situation and marries her. Mevlut was tricked by Suleyman who wants the younger, pretty 'Samiha' for himself.. Throughout the novel Mevlut senses a disconnect between self and the world-- and his lifelong efforts to harmonize the two.. Mevlut remains poor, working a variety of jobs while watching his initial vocation--as a street vendor selling yogurt and boza, a Turkish drink, disappear.. Mevlut walks at night - trying to sell his boza. Melancholy sets in.... ""Walking fueled his imagination and reminded him that there was another realm within our world, hidden away"".. There's many other characters who tell Melvut's unfolding story -- wonderful texture characters -- but this is Melvut's story. He uses his imagination to revise the past and make peace with the present! You gotta love this honorable, humble man selling boza!!!. Orphan Pamuk.... Winner of the Nobel Prize! Juicy storyteller!","Feb 08, 2017"
21496963,Aleks,"Well, after three weeks of reading I finally finished Orhan Pamuk’s latest novel “Kafamda Bir Tuhaflık”, probably the best book I have read so far in this year. Not only that the novel is, in Pamuk’s recognizable way, a rather thick volume, reading it also coincided with general renovation of my flat (btw, great way to spend summer), so I had a very little time to dedicate to the book. Nonetheless, I kept going and found out that reading of this novel not just fulfilled me in the way that good books often do but also made me calm and relaxed, and because of that gave me a much needed rest from the general fatigue.. Previously, I wasn’t impressed by Pamuk’s “Masumiyet Müzesi” (“The Museum of Innocence”), the first novel that came out after he received the Nobel prize. I thought that it had much to do with the award itself because it seemed to me that authors tend to publish somewhat lesser work after the Nobel. Perhaps a memoir or autobiography (although Pamuk’s already done that with the remarkable “Istanbul”) – something to sum up their work and their life. After the award, very rarely one produces a masterpiece that can compare with his greatest achievements produced during the peak of his vitality.. But I was wrong. Pamuk’s latest novel, in my opinion, is by far his best novel - and I’ve read almost all of them.. Although the novel’s main character is a poor. boza. street salesman, this book – which is the greatest of all Pamuk’s virtue and virtuosity – talks mostly about Istanbul, the city itself. Like in some of his previous works, Istanbul becomes very much alive, almost like a human itself. Pamuk’s love for his birthplace is undeniable, and he continuously proves that with every novel that he writes.. In that sense, “Kafamda Bir Tuhaflık” presents a history of Istanbul through main character, Mevlut Karatas, from 1969 to the 2012. Through that period, Istanbul changed in many ways – most of these ways were rather insurrectionary – and evidently, that continuous to happen today: in cultural, societal and identity aspects. The novel has everything: historical background, love story, social and cultural turbulences, multi-vocal narration and, most of all, incredible tableau of city of Istanbul.. Finally, I must thank the publishing house “Geopoetika” for the first world translation of this novel, and also recommend everybody to read it when it becomes translated in other languages. And if you befall to renovate your house or apartment while accidentally picking up “Kafamda Bir Tuhaflık” to read, just do what I did after I’d finished job for that day: just drop by the local delicatessen shop and refresh yourself with a glass of iced boza.","Jun 13, 2015"
32318315,Hugh,"There is something rather old-fashioned but charming about this sprawling, languorous family story set in Istanbul over 40+ years. The central character Mevlut is a poor street trader who supplements various day jobs by spending his evenings selling boza (a traditional slightly alcoholic drink) on the streets. This represents something of a departure for Pamuk whose previous books have been set among the city's richer elite. This one also allows more space to its female characters.. The first two chapters are out of sequence - the first covers the night when Mevlut elopes with his wife Rayiha. He has been writing to Rayiha since seeing her sister at a family wedding - his cousin Suleyman has tricked him into addressing the letters to the ""wrong"" sister, but it soon becomes clear that Rayiha is the better match. The second chapter is many years later as Mevlut suffers a crisis of confidence after being robbed by ruthless street thieves. The rest of the book is told in chronological order, starting when Mevlut arrives in the city as a boy to help his father in his yogurt and boza selling business.. The real subject of the book is the city itself - Pamuk chronicles its expansion, modernisation, political and sociological changes in great detail. The incorruptible but poor Mevlut is contrasted with his scheming (and richer) cousins.. For such a long book, this is a surprisingly easy read - the story telling always keeps you interested despite the mundane nature of much of the story. A pleasure to read.","Apr 17, 2017"
6051061,T.D. Whittle,"""I can only meditate when I am walking. When I stop, I cease to think; my mind works only with my legs."" Jean-Jacques Rousseau. ""I will sell boza until the day the world ends."" Mevlut Karatas (p. 584). This book is long and meandering, its power like that of a fire built slowly from a bit of kindling and a single spark. From the beginning, it is carefully tended and coaxed along in a quiet but steady fashion until. Whoosh!. , it ignites in full glory.. A Strangeness in My Mind. did not particularly grab me, in a dramatic sense, with its opening but it did interest me enough to keep going. It begins with the protagonist, Mevlut, a. boza. seller, and his fiancee, Rayiha, running away to elope. I liked Melvut and Rayiha, so I kept reading, all the while thinking that, yes, it is good; I am not loving it, but neither do I want to abandon it. We follow Mevlut's life from the time he is a boy of twelve until he is a man of fifty-five. The narrative structure is mostly linear, though there is a bit of slipping back and forth in time. There are a lot of characters in this book but I did not find them hard to keep track of. However, should you get lost, the author has provided a family tree at the beginning of the book and a character index and chronology at the end.. I felt bogged down in the years when Mevlut was an adolescent living alone with his father on the outskirts of the city, failing at his all-boys school, working as a street vendor, semi-stalking women he was obsessed with, and masturbating nonstop. Then, when Mevlut enters his mandatory military service, the book remains very male-focused, dominated by their interests, their dialogue, and their competitive struggles. Basically, these pages wreak of testosterone and musky sweat. As a woman reader, this bored me, I have to admit. I read a lot of books written by men, but I like the women and girls to be involved or I simply can't connect. *. Having said that, I did love wandering with Mevlut through Istanbul and hearing about the changes the city was undergoing over the years. And what happened over the course of the narrative is that my sense of intimacy with Mevlut and with Istanbul grew closer, insidiously, so that by the end I was shedding tears and felt a deep sympathy with him. Mevlut is within the city but the city is also within Mevlut. It is also a dynamic symbol of the tumultuous lives of impoverished Turkish families. Their fates and sorrows are intertwined.. So this is how Mevlut came to understand the truth that a part of him had known all along: walking around the city at night made him feel as if he were wandering around in his own head. That was why whenever he spoke to the walls, advertisements, shadows, and strange and mysterious shapes he couldn't see in the night, he always felt as if he were talking to himself. (p. 579). I cannot escape my impression that, if one were to put a gender to Istabul, it would be a woman: a grand and beautiful dowager who has been roughly treated but maintains her dignity and grace nevertheless. This is how the women in the book are presented, too. Though not all are roughly treated, they all have difficult lives, made all the more difficult by living in an oppressive patriarchy and struggling at various time with grinding poverty and lack of proper reproductive healthcare. In this way, I came to feel that Mevlut loved three women deeply and passionately during his lifetime: first, his crush, Samiha; then, his wife, Rayiha; and, from the age of twelive, his adopted city, Istanbul.. But just like believing in God, falling in love is such a sacred feeling that it leaves you with no room for any other passions.. By about halfway through. A Strangeness.... had hooked me. I realised how completely invested I had become in the characters' well-being. I had not felt terribly attached to Melvut before then and, really, it was the women becoming more of a presence in the book that made it take off for me (Melvut's wife, Rayiha, their daughters, and Rayiha's sisters). Over six hundred pages, I fell in love with Melvut, Rayiha, their girls, the girls' aunties, and the rampaged and rambling sprawl of old Istanbul. These are very ordinary people, with ordinary lives, but the story of these lives is rich and proves the point that no one's story is boring if you attend closely enough to the telling. Pamuk is masterful in the telling, but it's a subtle mastery. He does not bash you over the head with bigness. The dramas, while intense and worrying, are not over-played. There are deaths, even one murder, but the details given are only enough to tell us that these things happened. Nothing gratuitous. I appreciate Pamuk's discretion and feel that his choices of when to zoom in and out of focus are near perfect.. I am reflecting on the aftertaste of. A Strangeness in My Mind. , thinking that it's probably a lot like boza: nostalgic, sweet, and just a bit sour, all at the same time.. ""No, I'm not joking. Boza is holy,"" said Mevlut.. ""I'm a Muslim,"" said Suleyman. ""Only things that obey the rules of my faith can be holy."". ""Just because something isn't strictly Islamic doesn't mean it can't be holy. Old things we've inherited from our ancestors can be holy, too,"" said Mevlut. ""When I'm out at night on the gloomy, empty streets, I sometimes come across a mossy old wall. A wonderful joy rises up inside me. I walk into the cemetery, and even though I can't read the Arabic script on the gravestones, I still feel as good as I would if I'd prayed."" (p. 271). Two desires that will linger with me now are to wander aimlessly through the nighttime streets of Istanbul and to try boza for myself. Pamuk is a beautiful writer. I am looking forward to more of his books.. * Note: For this reason, although I enjoy fantasy, I did not enjoy.

28602001,Emma,"It is such a cliche to say that I 'got lost in the story' but if any novel should get this pronouncement from me, this is it. As always, Pamuk writes with a beauty and love for his native Istanbul; yet he is not one to show the city through a rose-tinted lens. The same goes for the people he potrays. Stylistically, the ever increasing build up of detail creates a set of characters and a sense of place that you, the reader, come to know intimately. Not only are you welcomed in to this world (which, for me, is so very different from my own), you become part of it. You see, hear, and smell the city. I know, and understand, Mevlut better than some of my friends and family. For this reason, the book can be exhausing (it took me two months to read), but it is also magical.. However, if you are new to Pamuk, I wouldn't start here. For me, none of his works can eclipse. My Name is Red. and I always recommend it.. Many thanks to Orhan Pamuk, Faber and Faber, and Netgalley for this copy in exchange for an honest review.","Oct 08, 2015"
6249204,Antonomasia,"Among my started-but-not-finished books, this now squats like Larkin's ""toad, work"" and I think it's time to declare it abandoned, at 61%. It's not. bad. , I don't 100% rule out returning to it, but this self-imposed obligation needs to be sacked off in favour of more enticing reads. Faster readers, and those more in the habit of reading 600pp+ novels, seem unlikely to find this an issue, especially when one considers the high 4.06 average Goodreads rating.. Mevlut the Boza Seller. - as I've no idea why the publishers didn't title it in English, evoking its 19th-century-novel ethos, and telling the reader more factually what the book is about (Mevlut, for all that he wonders about his own thoughts, being one of the least strange-minded characters one might encounter in the world of arty weirdos that populates literary fiction) - seems pretty great for giving a panorama of how political and religious changes have affected the lives of working people in Istanbul over the last several decades, and for its concentration on working class life without seeking to romanticise it, or treat it as a mere obstacle or starting gun for characters destined for a life with more money and more time to spend reading novels like this one. Millions of people live their whole lives similarly to Mevlut and his family, and contemporary fiction usually ignores them. (And if you are ever prone to feeling a tad resentful when you pick up a novel, because your life isn't one of endless years safely lolling about painting or writing and visiting friends, and spending quite freely - unlike so many literary characters - this book may make a welcome change: expending your reading time with people who also have to get up every morning for hard graft, and who still can't afford very much.). The first... perhaps third or so of the novel was great. There is something very measured about the writing: carry water and chop wood. But not hermitically so; this is also realist real life with other emotions and events. Mevlut is a very decent guy but also not a saint. As the novel wore on, though, it seemed to alternate between too much detail and not enough. Events were summarised too dully, I'd notice when returning to. Strangeness. after other books. Scenes weren't so alive. The issue was not what was happening, very much not - but how it was told. I'd still like to know how successive governments and increasing Islamicisation affect the characters for the rest of the story... but if only it could be summarised in 50 pages or so....

5927877,Kyriakos Sorokkou,"As always Pamuk never disappoints.. Another incredible book by Turkish Nobel Prize Winner (2006) Orhan Pamuk.. My 5th book by Pamuk.. My 4th novel by him since I read his Memoirs from Istanbul a non fiction book, part memoir part biography of his beautiful birthplace.. This novel like most of Pamuk's novels, takes place in Istanbul; this time between 1969-2012. It tells us the (simple) story of a simple man from Central Anatolia called Mevlut Karataş that came to Istanbul with his father in 1969 to become a boza seller.. Boza is a fermented beverage made from fermented wheat and it has a creamy / thick consistency.. The story might not be something extraordinary but Pamuk's writing and the way he structures the book makes it extraordinary.. This book is divided in seven parts.. Parts 1 and 2 are two different days in the life of Mevlut when something important happened.. Part 1 takes place on Thursday, 17 June 1982 and Part 2 on Wednesday, 30 March 1994.. Then in Parts 3, 4, and 5 which are the main bulk of the book we are taken back in the beginning of his life in Istanbul (1969) and we slowly slowly reach the important moments that happened in Parts 1 and 2.. Now Parts 6 and 7 work as mini epilogues and is where we see a conclusion of Mevlut's story in the book.. Part 6 takes place on Wednesday, 15 April 2009, and Part 7 on Thursday, 25 October 2012.. Another interesting thing of the way this book is structured is the narration. We have Mevlut's parts told in 3rd person narration and we also have 13 characters that tell us their own story in 1st person narration. All these characters are his friends, his family, and people from his close environment.. So on the one hand we see Mevlut's story from above with the help of an omnipresent narrator (3rd person) and from the other hand his story from 13 different points of view, that sometimes leave the main storyline (Mevlut) and are concentrated on their own story.. We see on the one hand Mevlut's life but through his life we are also able to see the history of modern Turkey.. This novel also has characteristics from Dickens' realism and also from the picaresque novels of the 18th century. This is because the subtitle and the first paragraph of the book are the whole story in other words spoilers. But as Pamuk said in an interview: good literature isn't concerned by spoilers and what is going to happen in the end but the actual journey - not the destination.. The book like many Pamuk books includes also an index of characters and a Chronology of events.. Now before I leave you I'll put here the Title the Subtitle and the first paragraph of the book.. A Strangeness in My Mind. Being the Adventures and Dreams of Mevlut Karataş, a seller of Boza, and his friends, and also a portrait of Life in Istanbul Between 1969 and 2012 from Many Different Points of View. This is the story of the life and daydreams of Mevlut Karataş a seller of boza and yogurt. Born in 1957 on the western edge of Asia, in a poor village overlooking a hazy lake in Central Anatolia, he came to Istanbul at the age of twelve, living there, in the capital of the world, for the rest of his life. When he was twenty-five, he returned to the province of his birth, where he eloped with a village girl, a rather strange affair that determined the rest of his days: returning with her to Istanbul, he got married and had two daughters; he took a number of jobs without pause, selling his yogurt, ice cream, and rice in the street and waiting tables. But every evening, without fail, he would wander the streets of Istanbul, selling boza and dreaming strange dreams..

66366804,Usman Hickmath,"Brilliant work from Pamuk. He has told the story of a street vendor taking almost 600 pages while maintaining the readability and have discussed issues such as poverty, struggle of middle class women, illegal construction, and Capitalist, Marxist and Islamist divide in the backdrop of a fallen empire. Have a look at this piece to understand the universality of issues elaborated in the novel.. The enterprising individual who built a house on an empty lot would plant a few poplars and willow trees and lay the first few bricks of a wall to mark out his property, after which he would go to the neighborhood council man and pay him something to draw up a document certifying that said individual had built the house in question and planted those trees himself. Just like the genuine title deed issued by the State Land Registry, these documents included a crude plan of the house, which the councilman himself would draw with a pencil and a ruler. He would jot down some additional notations in his childish scrawl-the adjacent plots belonging to this or that person, nearby fountain, the locations of the wall (which in fact might have consisted of no more than a rock or two here and there), and the poplar trees-and if you gave him some extra money, he would add a couple of words to widen the imaginary boundaries of the plot, before finally affixing his seal underneath it all.. In reality, the land belonged to the national Treasury or to the forestry department, so the documents provided by the councilman did not guarantee ownership at all. A house built on unregistered land could be knocked down by the authorities at any moment. Sleeping for the first time in the homers they’d built with their own hands, people would often have nightmares about this potential disaster. But the value of councilman’s document would prove itself when the government decided, as it tended to do every decade or so in election years, to issue title deeds for homes built overnight-for these deeds be handed out in conformity with the documents drawn up by the local councilman. Furthermore, anyone who was able to procure a document from the councilman certifying ownership of a plot of land could then sell that plot to someone else. During periods when the flow of unemployed and homeless immigrants to the city was particularly heavy, the price of these documents would rise, with the increasingly valuable plots quickly split up and parceled out, and the political influence of the councilman, needless to say, also climbing in proportion to the influx of migrants.","Oct 31, 2017"

Every single colour and flavour suddenly springs up through your brain chemistry.

How can even attempt to move on to another book. For ten minutes I would be inconsolable, then I would around for another clone , er book and I would be fine.. I am the complete mark for this book. I love urban centred narratives by nature, there is certain buzz to a city that I find intoxicating and you cannot get buzzier more chaotic and more urban than Istanbul. Pamuk writes literary about the city from the perspective of those who keep it buzzing long - the street venders, shop owners, inspectors, cleaners, builders.. There is so much more I could gush over, the different perspectives structured in such a gossipy way that they characters could only be family, how Pamuk dolled out small pieces of information about Istanbul itself or noting the passage of time or just his writing in general.

900800,Inderjit Sanghera,"A wonderful eulogy to life, love and Istanbul, ""A Strangeness in My Mind"" captures an ever-evolving Istanbul through the eyes of the Mevlut, from his arrival in the late 60's to the modern days. Through the eyes of Mevlut, Istanbul grows exponentially, gorging itself on the lives and dreams of its residents, bloated and bilious, irascible yet whimsical and wondrous, Mevlut charts the metamorphoses of Istanbul, from a city filled with the febrile hopes of Turkish nationalism, to a city which synthesises modernity with antiquity; the minarets co-existing with the skyscrapers, the secularism of the state with the religiosity of its citizens. Indeed it is the novel's greatest strength that is is able to capture the diversity of its Istanbul and Turkey's complex and multi-layered history, from the secularism of its state, the the religiosity of its citizens, who practice a relaxed form of Islam, where consumption of alcohol is not forbidden and sexual freedom is not such a taboo. From the incipient left-wing movements, to the military uprisings, to the expanding influence of Islamists, to the seedy under-belly of Istanbul's nightlife, Pamuk reflects upon the vast social change which is taking place in Istanbul, as it struggles under the weight of the numerous, and often contradictory, forces which shape it. More than this it is a paean to an Istanbul which has been swept up beneath the tides of modernity and intolerance, as demonstrated by the loss of the Greek, Assyrians and Armenians who were for so long part of the social fabric of Istanbul, only to become entangled under the influence of Turkish nationalism, slowly unravelling the richness and diversity which they brought to Istanbul.. The true brilliance of the novel, however, lies in the choice of protagonist and central narrator-Mevlut. A poor, down-trodden and fundamentally honest individual, it is Mevlut's intrinsic ordinariness which imbues his narrative with such strength and verve. From his relationship with those around him, such as his accidental wife Rayiha, his father, his cousin Suleyman and best friend Ferhat all of the side characters are drawn with nuance and depth, their relationships with Mevlut changing with time and circumstance. It is, however, Mevlut's relationship with Rayiha which forms the true cornerstone of the novel-when Mevlut is pondering on what he feels gave his life the most meaning, he felt that it was his love for Rayiha, more than his borza, more than his daughters or his perambulations around Istanbul which defined him, yet, beyond this, it is the small, indecipherable moments of happiness which Mevlut feels, from his youthful talks with Ferhat, to his marriage to Rahiya, Mevlut is able to draw the reader in, just as he was able to drawn-in the citizens of Istanbul with his soulful, melancholic voice whilst selling boza.","Oct 22, 2017"
11612758,Anna Baillie-Karas,"The story of Mevlut, a boza-seller, and his family.. I love Orhan Pamuk's honesty and his curious, loving explorations of Istanbul. He infuses the melancholy of the city into his writing, chronicles the changes - (too) much detail of construction and houses - and describes family dynamics with great care & intricate sentences.. I found this one too slow & less beautifully written than his earlier work (but it's a high bar). I wonder if some of this comes down to the translation.. I became tired of the idol-worship of women, but I found the women characters grew stronger as the novel went on, and I give Pamuk some leeway on this because I assume he's describing life as it was in Istanbul in the 1960s (through to today) rather than a more ideal, equal society. He shows the dilemma of women who try to be free and modern (wear a headscarf loosely, or not at all) but confront men expecting them to be more demure - mevlut's sister-in-law is expected not to leave the house, for example; it also deals with arranged marriages and a time when women were (are) treated as property..

1289391,Michael,"Orhan Pamuk, the winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature, is Turkey's best-selling writer and first Nobel Laureate, but he is more than a talented Turkish writer. He is an international treasure with books translated into sixty languages. Already established as a a major writer with his brilliant novels. My Name is Red. and. Snow. , he has produced in. A Strangeness in My Mind. a masterpiece that is both a. Bildungsroman. of Mevlut the street vendor of boza in Istanbul and a. Bildungsroman. of the modern city itself.. Pamuk is not only the best modern Turkish writer to express the concept of. huzun. (melancholy) in his works but also the contemporary master of nostalgia in an international context. Born in Istanbul in 1952, the author knows the complex city better than anyone else writing today. He understands the heritage of the past, the hopes for the future, and the contradictions of today. While he appreciates the Ottoman and Greek monuments of Istanbul and the old customs and traditions of the city, he also understands the needs and aspirations of its growing population and the unique place that Istanbul occupies as the bridge between Europe and Asia.. Istanbul is one of my favorite cities in the world, but Pamuk's writings have given me more insights into the city and its citizens than have all my visits. He has a finger on the pulse of this international city with its confusing and exhilarating blend of East and West, past and present. Seeing the city as it changes from 1969 until 2012 through the eyes of Mevlut, his relatives, and his friends gives one a real sense of what life is like in Istanbul for those who have come there from the provinces to pursue their fortunes with varying degrees of success or failure.. Kismet is a concept that plays a major role in the novel, as does the relationship between intention and action. Overlaying the whole story is the sense of melancholy, the feeling of nostalgia for a time and place now forever beyond the reach of those who yearn for it. It is a long novel, but for those who immerse themselves in it, it provides an entertainment and an education the value of which far exceeds the price of the book and the time devoted to reading it.. I remember one December day in the seventies on which a light rain was falling from cloud-shrouded skies as I walked along the seawall on my way to a seafood dinner. The waters of the Sea of Marmara were gray and troubled. In the wall were embedded pieces of column capitals and stones inscribed in Greek. Bits of Byzantium, Constantinople, and Istanbul blended together in no particular order, a mirror of the city itself. The clouds, the rain, the restless sea, and these fragments of the past assembled in a pastiche imbued me with the same. huzun. I feel when I read Pamuk or the. saudade. I experience when listening to traditional. fado. . It is a feeling that gives depth to the human experience wherever it might occur. Perhaps not since Homer's Odysseus has anyone longed for his home with as much feeling as Orhan Pamuk for an Istanbul that continually recedes into the past even as it advances into the future.","Dec 08, 2015"
8938367,Sophie Cayeux,"Review on. http://www.snowbeachpublications.com/.... A Gem. Brilliant. I couldn’t put it down. Pamuk never disappoints me – and once more he hasn’t. Through the daily life of ordinary characters, the author has the amazing talent of describing the social and political history of Turkey and how the city of Istanbul has changed during the twentieth century. He endears us to his characters, migrants from villages, who seek their fortune in Istanbul – a theme that remains contemporary. His depiction of urban sprawling and shanty towns reminds us of many other cities.. We follow Melvut, such a loving child then a man (and a whole bunch of other characters) through his struggles as he tries to keep his head above water to feed his family in a world that is confusing and keeps changing at a pace far too rapid for him to adapt. But all this time Melvut remains himself, true to his nature and this is stirring and beautiful.. His prose is simple and gripping. It is witty and ironical. Melvut’s writing of love letters to his beloved (to her eyes as he’s not seen more or talked to her) is one great example.. Pamuk addresses a number of social issues: the power of education, the naïve attraction of youth for money and life in a city, rampant corruption, the constant strain that conflicts and wars have on society and the restrictive nature of traditions on women’s life. His portrayal of the life of women, their lack of access to education in villages, their restricted choices in life, the way their future is mapped for them and their marriage is arranged as if they were property - again a reminder of how lucky some of us are to live in other societies. He offers some hope: one of Melvut’s daughter makes it to University, choses her husband - and moves away.. This is a multilayered story that stirs deep emotions. It is a powerful book that lingers deep in my thought. The technique Pamuk employs to tell this story is effective and impressive – he keeps moving the narrative forwards by seamlessly shifting from one character’s POV to another and adding gradually new POV. Absolutely brilliant.. The Island Girl","Sep 25, 2015"

7321024,Rositsa Zlatilova,"“These people’s happiness pleased Mevlut. Human beings were made to be happy, honest and open. He saw all this warmth in the orange light from the living room. He poured five kilos of his best boza...”. Orhan Pamuk. said. that. A Strangeness in My Mind. is a novel that allows a working-class character to speak for himself. Classic novels, he added, either portray the middle and upper classes exclusively, or show peasants through the eyes of the middle class.. In. A Strangeness in My Mind. , Pamuk instead chooses a protagonist who is. “not a hero but an everyman”. . Yet Pamuk also wanted the novel to read like an epic. Epics, he says,. “are endless seas of details”. and in them it’s. “the style and choice and quality and color of these details that comes out rather than the outcome of the story”. . As such, they provoke people to muse over major themes like time, identity and the meaning of life.. A Strangeness in My Mind. dwells on how Istanbul and the life of its inhabitants change massively over the span of 40 years, and how – even slowly – the role of women in the Turkish society evolves too, but all in all, it is an intimate account of the main character’s – Mevlut – life, happiness and struggles.. Constructed as a choir of many voices, the novel allows each character to reflect on Mevlut’s unfolding story. Pamuk also intervenes as a narrator to clarify events or explain certain aspects of the story.. Born in a poor village, situated 700 miles away from Istanbul, Mevlut leaves home at the age of 12 to follow his father to Istanbul. There begins a succession of failed attempts at schooling, small businesses, family matters, friendships and political engagements. The pivotal moment in Mevlut’s life is the instant when he glimpses his future wife at a wedding. Fascinated by her beautiful eyes, he spends his military service writing love letters to her. When they eventually meet again to elope to Istanbul, Mevlut realises that he has not been writing to the beautiful lover but to her older and plainer sister Rayiha. Too embarrassed to admit the mistake, he marries Rayiha anyhow.. Despite this troubled start, Mevlut and Rayiha find happiness together, they have two daughters and Mevlut continues to be a vendor seller who during the day – for and in different periods of time – sells yoghurt, ice cream and chicken with rice, and at nighttime – always, without a cease in his life – sells boza.. Through Mevlut’s eyes, Pamuk describes main events in the Turkish history over the last half century: political coups, tension between Turks and Kurds, the 1999 earthquake in Turkey, a Turk’s-eye view of 9/11. Mevlut witnesses how Istanbul’s one-room houses, built by their owners, get replaced by skyscrapers, erected by developers; how the city’s population grows by over four times for 40 years.. Mevlut never becomes rich, but he does experience moments of real happiness. His humbleness and melancholic feelings for a time and place far beyond the reach make him more alive and happier that the rest. His public and private views are the same; the thoughts in his mind and the feelings in his heart are the same.. For Mevlut, the strolling on the streets of Istanbul to sell boza is not just a way to make meet the ends, but a choice, vocation and manner to explore the strangeness in his mind. When people hear his distinctive cry “Boo-zaa” at night, they are seized with nostalgia and buy a cup, complemented with the traditional chickpeas and cinnamon on top, for old times’ sake.. Pamuk borrows the book title from William Wordsworth’s autobiographical poem. The Prelude. . The line continues:. “A feeling that I was not for that hour,/ Nor for that place.”. For Wordsworth, to walk was to think, and Mevlut shares an almost spiritual commitment to the strolls.. “Walking around the city at night made him feel as if he were wandering around inside his own head,”. writes Pamuk.. In a way, boza serves Pamuk as a metaphor for the collision between tradition and modernity, conformity and hypocrisy. Boza sellers and the urban poor evoke different feelings in the Turkish society. Some see them as old fashioned villagers that need taming and “repairing”, while others accept and cherish them as a reminiscent of the old days.. Throughout the narrative, Pamuk implies the importance of having the same public and private views in order to experience happiness. Also, one should know that the intentions of the heart and the intentions of the words are equally important.. Kismet. is a concept that plays a major role in the novel too, as does the relation between intention and action. Understanding and accepting these wisdom beliefs, Mevlut chooses to observe the world from the outside as if knowing that this is the only way to see it more vividly and fully.. A Strangeness in My Mind. is a love letter to the city that Pamuk calls. “the capital of the world”. in its entirety. Above all, however,. A Strangeness in My Mind. is a poetic chronicle, infused with warmth and compassion, of the everyman’s life. It is a book that breathes through its protagonist – this willful outsider who is happier than anyone and everyone, who loved indefinitely and was loved unconditionally, and whose night strolls, accompanied by a “Boo-zaa” cry, help him make sense of the world around him and remind him that once he was loved too.","Mar 11, 2016"
58296635,Sidharth Vardhan,"I have been used to be expecting far, far better from Pamuk and, apparently, he put in a lot of effort into this one. Istanbul is his favorite topic - his memoir was also a very good introduction to the life in the city. This love shows here as well. There are a variety of perspectives you see Istanbul from - that of migrants, conservatives, communists, street paddlers, cart owners, electricity department employees, waiters, those doing their necessary millitary time, house maids,taxi drivers, shop owners etc. The protagonist himself undertakes some of these jobs while Pamuk's universe always aquire Tolstoyean proportions.. If Tolstoy like epics are your high, you are in for a treat here. Personally I could not found myself building any momentum as the center of this universe is story of a family that reads like a daily soap story. The characters just didn't interest me and, a big pain was the prose which had little that impressed me - that is another area I am used to expecting much better quality from Palmuk.","Jun 16, 2019"

5687551,Josh Caporale,"Glenn Russell, who is an avid Goodreads reviewer, takes a great amount of consideration into the intent and the work that an author puts into their work when putting together a five-star review, which is why these are the only kind of reviews he puts together. The fact that Pamuk put six years into this project shows a heavy amount of commitment in what is something spectacular, but most importantly something that turned out to be a great experience.. Mevlut is our central character in this work of Turkish literature. At a young age, he has come to Istanbul to sell boza (a mildly alcoholic drink) and yogurt (until it became more likely to see yogurt in the markets sold commercially), as well as go to school. Along with his father, Mustafa, Mevlut's Uncle Hasan and cousins Korkut and Suleyman are involved in the business. These relatives play a huge role in their lives, for better or for worse. Korkut marries a girl named Vediha, who is one of Abdurrahman Efendi's three daughters. At their wedding, Mevlut falls for Samiha, but mistakenly elopes with Rayiha, but this does not prevent him from having a satisfying life with his wife and two daughters. This novel follows the many events of Mevlut's life from 1968 until 2012 and is told by the point of view of multiple characters. Surprising enough, the only direct perspective we do not hear from is Mevlut's, which is definitely different, but works nevertheless.. After reading the table of contents and the family tree at the beginning of the book, both of which create a great foundation for this novel, you are going to have an idea of the things that are bound to happen. At the same time, it does not tamper with your reading experience, for you are bound to be interested in ""why"" and ""how."" You will know when things take place just by reading these details, but yet Pamuk has the ability to keep your attention with the curveballs he throws for readers that are guessing between a few options as to what they believe will happen.. Pamuk is also great at breaking fourth wall in order to explain things to readers, knowing that his audience reaches far beyond Turkey. By doing this, non-Turkish readers like myself have the opportunity to know about what life was like in Turkey and how it took them a little bit longer to reach the mark that countries like the United States reached. Knowing that most of us would not have much of an idea as to what boza is, he explained it at the very beginning. This was a great help and it allowed me as a reader to enjoy the experience in learning about the people, culture, customs, and point of view of the Turkish people. Their response to 9/11 in America was from a really interesting view that really lingered in my mind.. Orhan Pamuk won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2006 and after reading this novel, his achievement was rightfully so. Pamuk has done an outstanding job sharing details about his culture to a global audience and after reading this, I know much more about a perspective I knew little about before reading this. I read this as a buddy read with Michelle from MichEllisLife on Booktube and am really glad that I had the opportunity to do so. This was a great choice and I definitely plan to read more of Orhan Pamuk's novels in the future. This is my first five-star rating since September 2015, when I gave that rating to This Side of Time by Ko Un..

3409334,Michelle Ellis,"4.5 stars. Here is a link to my video review:. https://youtu.be/28bJfU7Mgoc. This story takes place in Turkey. The main focus is on Istanbul but we see smaller towns around Istanbul as well.. Our main character's name is Mevlut. He moved to Istanbul with his father at the age of 12 to continue his education and to help sell yogurt and Boza at night with his father.. The story talks about Mevlut's life as a street vendor as well and what life was like for Turkish people during this time period. The author does a fabulous job showing the non native reader what Turkey was like at this time and historically what was going on.. We see politics, religious division, living situations, military life, the education system, as well as property development and employment situations (word this all better).. The writing in this book was very engaging and accessible. I will admit that during the military/ political sections I lost a bit of steam while reading but that was at no fault to the author.. Pamuk brings us to the streets of Istanbul and we sell yogurt, Boza and ice cream right beside Mevlut. We fall in love with him and his friend.. He breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the reader several times throughout the book. Several characters break up the chapters with their input in the story. They clear up the story so that the main narrator's story is to unreliable.. This book is phenomenal and I see why it has made it onto the short list. If you have wanted to diversify your reading and learn about a the history of foreign country, pick this book up and walk beside Mevlut.","Apr 26, 2016"
12371038,Anuja Chandramouli,"It must be confessed that following a laboured perusal of Pamuk’s The Black Book and The Museum of Innocence, this reviewer was forced to conclude that the Noble Laureate’s prose was self – indulgent, lugubrious and tedious in the extreme, which leaves one bored to tears and balked at the prospect of wading through nearly 600 pages of his latest novel. Happily, though, Orhan Pamuk is one of the few authors who evolve and churn out their best stuff, after getting over themselves and the fact that they were heavily feted relatively early in their careers. His writing is more beautiful than ever and no longer sterile but infused with warmth, wit and gentle pathos.. A Strangeness in my Mind is a marvel of storytelling that traverses through forty years of history as it chronicles the life of a lowly street vendor, Mevlut Karatas of the boyish good looks and sweet disposition. Born in a tiny village in rural Anatolia, he migrates with his father to Istanbul at the age of 12 and finds himself grappling with a succession of failures as he struggles with schooling, political activism, a stint in the army, and petty business ventures that include peddling yoghurt, boza, ice cream, cooked rice and chicken, managing a small café and a turn as the Junior inspector for an electric company. The highlight of Mevlut’s early days included stalking an attractive stranger and endless stolen moments devoted solely to masturbation.. At his cousin Korkut’wedding, Mevlut falls madly in love with the bride’s exquisite 13 – year old sister. For the next three years, he pours his passion into painstakingly compiled letters addressed to her “languid eyes” which are like “ensorcelled arrows” and “bandits cutting across his path” plus similarly hilarious fare. His cousin Suleymen, volunteers to bring the lovers together and tricks Mevlut into eloping with Rayiha, the less attractive older sister of the object of his desire, to whom the letters had been delivered. A bemused Mevlut deals with this turn of affairs with the doggedness and acceptance that is so characteristic of him.. Every one of his relatives and friends go on to amass riches spurred on by the burgeoning prosperity of Istanbul forced into being by the political corruption as well as private greed of its citizens. Obstinately honest, success continues to elude him and yet he is the only one who seems to have unlocked the doorway to true happiness for it is his life which is graced with convivial bliss, cherished familial ties, fulfilment and inner tranquillity even as he remains mired in poverty.. Throughout the major upheavals in the capital and the myriad changes in his personal life, Mevlut sells boza, “a traditional Asian beverage made of fermented wheat, with a thick consistency, a pleasant aroma, a dark, yellowish colour, and low alcohol content” by night. It has been supplanted by raki in traditional Turkish homes, but people still buy a glass induced by nostalgia and the emotion in Mevlut’s voice as he meanders through the streets of the city which he realizes has become an extension of the light and darkness in his own mind.. This is by far Orhan Pamuk’s most joyous novel though conflict and tragedy there is aplenty from political coups, violence between the Turks and Kurds, murder of a dear friend and a primitive abortion attempt that claims a life. Through it all Mevlut taps into his indomitable optimism and “his knack for finding the easiest and least distressing way through any situation.” His saga unfolds in the third person though a host of characters intervene to make sure their voices are heard as well, imbuing the reader with the profound love, wonder and pride they feel for their Turkish identity and the city of Istanbul that threw open its arms and drew them into its bosom.","Jan 24, 2016"
8512171,Nan Williams,"Does this story ever go anywhere? It's supposed to cover 50 years in the building or re-building of Istanbul. Maybe it eventually gets somewhere, but 1/3 of the book was enough for me. Nothing happened in the first 1/3 except the same things over and over and over. Yes, our protagonist got older, but not wiser (maybe he gains wisdom in the last third). He sells boza (a drink) and yogurt on the streets at night - first with his father and then independently of his father. He is enrolled in a state school and flunks out because he neither attends class nor does his work. But then he's re-enrolled and flunks out again - maybe twice more. The only real change in his life is that he discovers masturbation. The author spends a LOT of time and print on this subject.. I was really interested in reading this novel as I've read a lot about Ataturk and his modernization of the Ottoman Empire following WWI.. This was a big disappointment. I don't think I'll pursue other books by this author.","Dec 19, 2015"

I was fairly surprised of how smoothly the reading was going and how intriguing everything was. At some point, though, I was a bit bored. There's this issue with Pamuk - I always find something missing, something I lack in his novels. Here, for example, I was overdosed with the political background of Istanbul and Turkey all in all. On the other hand, I did expect more 'internal' insight in and of the characters.. Still, a great book I surely will recommend!","Dec 08, 2016"

6970638,Sheri,"This is essentially a biography of a fictional character. Pamuk creates an ideal type in Mevlut (the poor country boy who comes to Istanbul to find a better life) and then allows him to be a filter for the political and economic changes in Istanbul. Mevlut is really NOT a real person, but rather a stereotype.. It is unsettling to me that this book is mostly about Mevlut and mostly in 3rd person and yet about 1/3 of it is first person narration by everyone else in Mevlut's life. Pamuk (I assume) was trying to say something about perspective (almost all of these ""other"" narrations are instances in which the other characters justify their actions) and choice and narcissism, but in this reader's opinion, it further made Mevlut less than human.. Mevlut is the ""everyman"", but he is not. Simply by being such a chameleon (blending with both sides of the political argument and the religious/atheists), he becomes no one. I found this to be especially obvious when he spent one night putting up Communist propaganda with Ferhat only to spend the next night painting nationalist slogans over these posters with Korkut and Suleyman. Of course, this is also illustrated by Suleyman's mockery: ""How do you even explain someone like Mevlut, who wrote a girl weepy love letters for years and then did nothing when he saw that he'd run away in the dead of night not with the pretty girl he'd fallen for but with her sister?"". However, the book itself is a great historical setting piece. Set in Instanbul from mid-60s until present time, Pamuk gives so much information about the political unrest and the religious fights and the development and corruption in government. I really know almost nothing about Turkey and felt like I learned a lot of history here (and also felt...although I could be wrong...that it was fairly balanced; Mevlut does not take sides, but befriends all and SO Pamuk presents all sides).. I was not sure I completely understood the dog theme throughout. Mevlut is chased by dogs throughout and he has a terrible fear of street dogs. As a kid, he reads an article about dogs' ability to read people's minds. And then as an adult, the Holy Guide tells him ""Dogs can sense when a person doesn't belong among us....all our dogs now have a very keen sense of who is their friend and who is their foe."" This implies that Mevlut does not really belong in Istanbul, he is not really a Turk. Maybe it is Pamuk's way of agreeing with my note above that Mevlut is not REAL. Or just that he is a wimp?. Besides the history (and the interesting cultural and political information), the thing that makes Pamuk's writing worthwhile is his commentary on human nature and relationships. Especially in the cultural context of Turkey, we have the seemingly contradictory, but fully explainable: ""The lies were part of the ritual, and just because we were lying, it didn't mean we weren't sincere. We understood one another's private motivations, while making sure to keep up public appearances."" I was also struck by this one: ""There's plenty of women who've gone mad with regret over an abortion, but never in the history of the world has a woman ever regretted having a child."" I don't know if that one is true, but certainly even unwanted children have a way of worming into parents' hearts.. The title was also referenced several times; Pamuk reminds me of something that I also read in David Foster Wallace. Basically, we are all hiding something and in our fear of discovery are blind to the fact that everyone else is hiding something as well. Obsessed with our own issues, we are alone: ""In a city, you can be alone in a crowd, and in fact what makes the city a city is that it lets you hide the strangeness in your mind inside its teeming multitudes."" and ""'There's a strangeness in my mind....No matter what I do, I feel completely alone in this world.'"". Of course, the main plot of the story is the romance between Rayiha and Mevlut. Mevlut spots a beautiful girl at a wedding and proceeds to write her letters for three years. At the end of this he convinces her to elope with him and only during the elopement does he discover that the woman who shows up (and to whom he has been addressing his letters) is not the same one he noticed at the wedding. His cousin, Suleyman, also wanting the beautiful girl, has lied to Mevlut about the girl's name. So the letters intended for Samiha have been going to Rayiha. Of course being the easy going Mevlut, he just goes with it and marries Rayiha (he also comes from a tradition of arranged marriages and has been subject to many discussions of whether it is better to know your bride prior to the wedding or get to know her after...marrying a complete stranger who is NOT the girl of your dreams is not in fact an odd thing for him). And Rayiha makes him incredibly happy. In fact, later after she dies and he ends up with Samiha we see many ways in which he was better off with Rayiha.. Overall this was a pretty book that describes a vastly different culture from mine and explores the roles of fate vs intention in ""everyman's"" life.","Feb 20, 2017"

33119635,Neil,"An ordinary man in an extraordinary city. Because there are really two main characters in this book: Mevlut is the ordinary man, the street-seller with his beloved boza, but the city of Istanbul vies for first place in the reader's attention.. The story follows Mevlut over several decades and sees him in various jobs and relationships. But, in truth, what we also watch is the changing shape of Istanbul as it explodes from 3 million to 13 million inhabitants and as the ramshackle houses people built for themselves are replaced by multi-storey blocks built by developers.. I imagine anyone who has lived in Istanbul reading this book and repeatedly shouting out ""I've been there - I recognise that!"". It has the feel of a book that would delight people who know the city with its insights and with its geographical setting. For someone, like me, who hasn't even been to Turkey, I believe it gave a real feel of the heart of the city (obviously, impossible to say for sure having not been there).. And Mevlut? He doesn't get involved in much and life happens to him more than him driving it. He never becomes rich, but he does experience happiness and some moments of intense sadness (yes, I cried a couple of times). The author has a way of dropping bombshells on you as a sort of afterthought at the end of a chapter and some of them, even if you suspect they might be coming at some point, take you by surprise.. It's a long book, but I am glad it is because it gives you time to get to know the people and the city.","Mar 18, 2016"
19054312,Adithya,"Aaah, well.. Sometimes you expect too much from your favourite authors. But despite these expectations, I felt immensely disappointed by Pamuk's 'A Strangeness in My Mind'. Even the most ardent critics will agree that Pamuk's prose is impeccable. His language flows and you immediately get captivated with the way he wraps you in and makes you comfortable with his simple story lines. Let me explain.... Pamuk's 'My Name is Red' is a great story. The book speaks to you. Trees and objects are characters in themselves and the storyline is powerful as much as it's engaging. The 'Museum of Innocence' on the other hand, is a book with a decent storyline but impeccable writing. You want to read every word of the 600+ pages masterpiece, because of its language; the way he weaves the words like a powerful symphony. These are two different books - one that relies on its storytelling, the other on its prose. And I loved both his works.. Pamuk's latest venture falls flat on both ends unfortunately. Neither was the prose lyrical, nor did I particularly enjoy the story. It was 600+ pages of the life of a passionate boza seller, and we get it, but did he really need that gigantic a book to convey Mevlut's thoughts? Meh.","Nov 22, 2015"

Mevlut’s Uncle and particularly his children (Mevlut’s two cousins) get more involved in property development (and in time right-wing politics) and middle-class success while Mevlut stays in relative poverty as a street vendor of Boza – a drink of fermented wheat (which traditionally was taken as non-alcoholic and so acceptable to Muslims).. The real character though is Istanbul – and its development over a 20-30 year period (against a background of world events).. Mevlut himself is a simple good-natured character full of nostalgia for an increasingly lost world which his stubbornness in selling Boza echoes – and he himself serves for other characters both as an emblem of backwardness (mainly for his cousins) and for many of his customers as an emblem of nostalgic tradition in a rapidly transforming world..

42294189,Roger Brunyate,"In the Streets of Istanbul. The subtitle nails it: ""Being the Adventures and Dreams of Mevlut Karatas, a Seller of Boza, and of His Friends, and Also a Portrait of Life in Istanbul Between 1969 and 2012 from Many Different Points of View."" The Nobel prizewinner's new novel is just that: a view of the changing city through the eyes of a village boy who came there as a teenager, dropped out of school, and spent most of his life selling yoghurt and boza (a low-alcohol fermented drink) in the street. The subtitle also gives an indication of the almost folklike style of Pamuk's writing here, unassuming and very approachable (at least in the translation by Ekin Oklap), quite different from the dense texts of. Snow. or. My Name is Red. .. It also alludes to one especially charming feature: the way various other speakers interject their voices and viewpoints into the story for anything from a paragraph to a couple of pages, as though they were reading over Mr. Pamuk's shoulder and saying, ""Hey, wait a minute! I have something to say here!"". The story is not quite in chronological order. It begins in 1982, when Mevlut, now 25, goes back to his village to elope with the girl he had glimpsed at a wedding long before, and to whom he has been writing for the past three years. Only when they get onto the train does he realize that (as with the Biblical Jacob and Leah) the family has palmed him off with the elder sister. But they decide to make the best of it. That is Mevlut all over: getting the short end of the stick, but looking on the bright side even so. By the next chapter, he has been married 12 years, and is still going out on his boza rounds every night. The main part of the story then begins back in 1968, when Mevlut comes to Istanbul with his father, going to school in the morning, selling yogurt in the afternoons. He has high hopes of doing well in school and becoming a doctor or a teacher—he is bright after all—but we already know that life will not turn out that way for him. This long section will explain what actually does happen, with the curious result that the more things turn against Mevlut, the more we like him.. That liking never left me, but I can't say the latter part of the novel gripped me quite as much as the opening. Pamuk's writing continues as equably as ever, although the sheer density of Turkish names can make it hard at times. Mevlut's extended family saga of lives, births, deaths, marriages (and even another elopement) continues to provide low-key domestic interest. Against that, we get the background of events in Turkey—an army coup, struggles between the left and right, religious schisms—that would mean more to Turkish readers, but whose inclusion prevents the book becoming too parochial. And around it, Istanbul itself changes: the old quarters are torn down, highways are built, the unlicensed buildings that had mushroomed on undeveloped ground are replaced by new tower blocks. Near the end, Mevlut stands on the balcony of one such building, looking out over Istanbul:. Mevlut sensed that the light and darkness inside his mind looked like the nighttime landscape of the city. Maybe this was why he'd been going out into the streets to sell boza in the evening for the past forty years, no matter how little he earned from it.. And we learn a lot more about how he came to marry the wrong bride, and how he comes once again to meet up with her younger sister he thought he had been writing all those letters to. And discover that in the experience of love and marriage, there need be no ""wrong"" after all. It is a beautiful ending to an overlong but charming book.","Apr 29, 2016"

I had a difficult time getting interested in this book at first, partly due to my unfamiliarity with both cultural and geographic landmarks that I assume most Turks would understand easily and partly due to the fact that these unfamiliar terms and names were coming to me in auditory form rather than written.. However, once I I had gotten the basic characters straight in my mind (and done some Googling about certain terms and places), I found the story fascinating.

Fascinating history of Istanbul and its land, things happening all around the years-- cultural and morality, social and political, love and relationship, friendship and family.

183639,Irwan,"Such a sweet story, I am tremendously sad that it ends. Sweet, as I always thought, would never be the word I use to describe Pamuk’s work. But I just did.. The little girl who saw “the boy who read under the plane tree” was the best closure of this lifelong love story. At which point I already feel how much the man whom that boy has turned into loves her. Strangely I do too.. The soft-hearted Mevlut, never wanting to hurt anyone in any ways, has shown many times that when life’s turning points do not present you with what you intended, you are still the one responsible for your own happiness. “Responsible” may be such an ambitious and banal word in this context, as if you have all the informations about your life at any given time. Just learn from Mevlut and his tricky business of elopement and choose your own word to describe what he chose to do at that time.. The novel that covers the decades of Mevlut’s life shows how people and your environment change over time. It makes it so easy to relate to your own life. How relationships with family members, friends and lovers start, get entangled, break, reconnect and create the intricate interweaved fabric of life.. I am not going to state the obvious, that has been repeated by many other reviews, about this book being a love letter to Istanbul, the author’s beloved city. Although his choice of setting and characters makes me reflect along, how many lives might resemble Mevlut’s in my own hometown of millions of people, Surabaya, or our capital Jakarta, where urbanization has always been part of their dynamics. A life that originates from the simplicity of a village life and thrives and helps shape the big city it adopts. Like Pamuk, I am now remembering the street vendors that my sisters and I enjoyed waiting and calling upon as kids. We excitedly watched them prepare our bakso (meatball soup) or nasi goreng (fried rice), and curiously asked them about their life. Being far away from my hometown, those street vendors have been a significant part of my childhood memories, a part of my city!. Those street vendors must have walked my city night after night. Maybe, like Mevlut, they have had an intimate bond to my city, talking to it about their sadness or happiness in their life.. Mevlut’s quiet declaration in the last sentence of the book (don’t look!) becomes even stronger if you relate it to the wisdom he has learned: “the intentions of the hearts and the intentions of the words were equally important.”. This book makes me happy.","Sep 23, 2015"
8676809,Gearóid,"Absolutely brilliant!. I got completely absorbed in this book....it was just so fascinating!. Orhan Pamuk writes beautifully of Istanbul and the Turkish people.. Such detail of the city changing over years and the people changing in the story as they get older and adapt to all these changes.. He is really an exceptional writer.. I have struggled from time to time with Orhan Pamuk's books but its been well worth persisting. and getting to understand his writing as it is very enjoyable and rewarding at the end of the day.. Highly recommend this book and ""The Museum Of Innocence""","May 08, 2016"
16975898,Gabriela,"The story of a Turkish family in Istanbul between the 1960s-2014, with a very carefully constructed main character, the boza seller Mevlut. His narrative perspectiv is mixed with the perspective of his father, his loving wife and daughters, his relatives, in a subtle dynamic, like a magical real life Persian carpet. In a permanent flow, the city changes and with it, the life of the characters. Only Mevlut remains true to himself and his principles, wandering Istanbuls streets every night and searching for answers, which he ultimately can only find within.","Oct 16, 2016"

156770,Maisya Farhati,"I really need a while to reflect after reading this novel. The love story, family conflict, and overall transformation of a city. In addition to personal life of the characters, Orhan Pamuk has successfully brought various issues through 'A Strangeness in My Mind': history, politics, as well as social and development issues (urbanization to be more specific).. This is the first time I read Pamuk's work (and I really want to read more of his). The reason I was interested in the book was because the story revolves in Istanbul, one of my favorite cities (that I've visited so far). I have to admit that I used to see Istanbul as an outsider who came to the city for a few days and visited those popular touristy destinations. However, this book tells the other side -- ups and downs -- of the city. Pamuk lets the readers get to know Istanbul through the life of boza seller (boza is a kind of Turkish traditional drink) named Mevlut.. As for me, the more I turn the page, the stronger attachment I feel towards him. Probably, it is understandable for the story spans over more than forty years, from 1968 to 2012. Over that period, there have been quite a transformation in the city. To name some of the changes that affect the characters are the emergence of modernly processed and packaged foods and beverages that hurt the business of street vendors and the massive construction of apartments that requires demolition of old buildings. For those people who have witnessed all the changes throughout decades, it could be hard and devastating to leave behind all the memories they have.. On the romance side of the story, I must say that it is not a common one. Imagine a young man eloped with a girl to whom he's been sending love letters for three years. But then on the day they are eloping, the young man just realized that apparently it's not the girl he's been thinking all this time. But, what to do now? As Pamuk wrote in the novel, 'the die is cast'. That's what happened to Mevlut and Rayiha. They 'accidentally' committed to each other in a marriage.. The forty years of Mevlut's life in Istanbul involved many characters with their own complication. One of the most important relations is with his uncle's family who have been very helpful in some cases but could also put Mevlut in many uneasy situations. During the forty years, some people change, some stay the same. The city has transformed a lot, but something remains in Mevlut's heart.. Thank you, Orhan Pamuk, for writing this beautiful story. :"")","Apr 22, 2018"

5098725,Debarghya Paul,"The sea was as dark as dreams and as deep as sleep. Have you read a book that calms you down? That soothes your soul? That which flows on its own, and before you know it you start wishing it would never end... ""A Strangeness in My Mind"" is one such novel. A novel of epic proportions, this is Orhan Pamuk at his best. The ""strangeness"" about this novel is that throughout its vast scope of literary genius nothing of significance happens. Yet it draws you in and relaxes you, like only good books can.. The central character of this book is Mevlut, a poor ""Boza"" seller in the streets of Istanbul. Struggling to adapt to a fast changing city Mevlut keeps on hoping for a better tomorrow even in all his failures. The book captures all his hopes, aspirations and failures beautifully. The love he has for the city is almost a touch autobiographical from the author. If you loved Pamuk's ""Istanbul"" then this book is definitely for you. Slowly and slowly you would start falling in love with this grand old city.. At the heart of this novel is a love story. Of Mevlut and his wife Rayiha. Of Mevlut and his craft. Of Mevlut and his city. A man fiercely protecting his fast dying craft of Boza selling. A man loving his wife to the last day. A man discovering his city through all his life's joy and despair.. In a city you can be alone in a crowd,and in fact what makes the city a city is that it lets you hide the strangeness in your mind inside its teeming multitudes. The book is also more than just about a Boza seller. There are so many voices in this novel. This style of writing is unique where many people involved in Mevlut's life share their own story, in their own voices.. As the book grows on you, every trivial detail of this man's life seem important. And then you come to realise how the uneventful things in our life means the most to us and our loved ones. Mevlut is a failure by society's standards in a thriving city. But he never moans this and neither the author. He is average and honest, and he thrives in that.. The book sails you through a city. Through Mevlut and his life and love. And as he keeps on searching for a meaning to his ""strangeness"" in an endless sea of possibilities; you might just stop and reflect back on your own life. In all its glories and defeats.. This is probably the best work of Orhan Pamuk yet. It stays with you long after you have read the last page. So much so that long after it ends, you might just hear the Boza seller crying out, ""Bozaaaaa, Good Bozaaa""","Oct 24, 2015"
47188780,Kathleen,"Nobel-Prize winner Pamuk has written a novel around his beloved city of Istanbul through his main character Mevlut Karatas, a street seller of boza--a traditional, mildly alcoholic wheat drink. ​Indeed, Pamuk's subtitle is ""Being the Adventures and Dreams of Mevlut Karatas, a Seller of Boza, and of His Friends and Also a Portrait of Life in Istanbul Between 1969 and 2012 From Many Different Points of View"". It is a sprawling tale following a large cast of characters crossing lines of class, politics, religion and gender.. ​The novel allows each character to tell his or her portion of Mevlut's unfolding story. Born in a poor village in the province of Konya, around 700 miles south-east of Istanbul, in 1957. Mevlut leaves his home 12 years later and follows his father to Istanbul. There begins a succession of failed attempts at schooling, small businesses, and political engagements. Attending the wedding of his cousin, he spies a young girl with beautiful eyes and falls in love with her. Over three long years, he writes her love letters, which he entrusts to her brother-in-law (and his own cousin), saying that he wants to marry her. At last, Suleyman arranges an elopement. All is set for the couple to flee, but, just before boarding the train, Mevlut discovers that the girl is NOT the one Mevlut had fallen in love with, but her older sister. Mevlut says nothing, accepts his fate, and attempts to understand the new love that is born from this trickery.. His attitude is not one of resignation, but of gratitude for unexpected gifts. Mevlut's life is one of ongoing generous recognition and marveling acceptance of such ​revelations. Rayiha proves to be the love of his life. Or should I say, one of his loves. The second love is wandering Istanbul at night selling boza, the drink of choice under the Ottomans. Mevlut's Istanbul is more than just people, and Pamuk pulls into his novel the physical history of the city. We are given whole epics of real estate, chronicles of construction projects, the history of electricity consumption, and much more. There is the ebb and flow of political movements--the rise of Islamism, the ethnic cleansing of the Greeks and the Armenians, Turkey's efforts to quash Communism, and so on.. There is intellectual richness in this tale of a simple street seller.","May 04, 2016"
10360290,Mostafa Mostafa,"Six years into the making, Orhan Pamuk has outdone himself with this book!. I read My Name is Red 7 years ago, i was fascinated by its writing style most of all, i tried other Pamuk's books and they were all average...untill i read this book where both the style and the plot are sure to keep you reading!. Welcome to Istanbul in the late 1969, you are Mevlut... You can wander its streets at night and feel the city breathing as you call out for ice cream and Boza!. The relationship between Mevlut and his city is very true and vivid; a friendship! How the city changes as Mevlut changes and ages; from the moment Mevlut sets foot in it till 2012 has been described in an amazing way! How the tall buildings replaced the simple houses; how people who wander the streets changed; you can witness all this and more within the 600 pages of this book; calling you to visit the city yourself!. And here lies part of this novel's beauty!. Istanbul is one of the main characters in this book, which shows Pamuk's passion and love to his city in most of the pages!. All the characters are alive; most of them interrupt the narrator to express their opinions and talk with the reader (just like My Name Is Red); each character ( no matter how minor) has its own voice in this book!!! So between your hands is no ordinary book, rather a well written book and most of all...a book with a breath of life!. The dogs in the book are one of the symbolic aspects used; where they keep attacking Mevlut all throughout the book except at the end, where both Mevlut and Istanbul merge into one!. Lots of topics were discussed in this book; our fates and destinies which are affected by a very small act...our heart's and brain's intentions, which expresses which ??. And our happiness...you make your own happiness...be it in a small house or a fancy one! Wether you are one of the most successful person in the country or you are simply...a Boza seller! Satisfaction is the key to they joy of this world; so it is up to you!. But does satisfaction limit your ambitions? You have to ask Mevlut!. The romantic relationships in this book are really delicately woven!. I will stop here so that you can Read this book!!!","Jan 13, 2016"
28265907,EJ,"""Istanbul never ends"" says Samiha at one point of the journey. And that's exactly how one could define the soul of this modern epic. Its not the best ever from Pamuk, when compared to Snow and The Museum of Innocence its not anywhere near, but what makes this one special is that its the perfect master piece of Pamuk in which the immeasurable phenomenon called 'Time' reigns. Not through eyes of Istanbul bourgeoisie, but through the silent murmurs of one among the million hearts 'which wants one thing, but end up with another instead, yet still claiming to be happy', Pamuk's makes us live 40 years in that city. Propulsive, melancholic, tempting, poetic. One could feel the weight of time. Apparently nothing stuns you, but you will feel those last words of the novel getting engraved in the walls of your heart. What makes this one more desirable is the usual spirit of genuine narration which Pamuk entails. While you read, you gets counted as one among the growing million population of Istanbul. Pamuk unleashes his disappointment over political fist fights which has wounded the turkish psyche but remarking that ""..these people will never stop fighting, they'll never tire of hacking away each other - POLITICS IS JUST AN EXCUSE..."". That pole, which the boza sellers carriers depicts the despairs of a struggling mass which could hardly balance their lives. Their role is that of a mere witness. The most beautiful words which I would pick out from this throbbing tale is this one, ""In a city, you can be alone in a crowd, and in fact what makes the city a city is that it lets you hide the strangeness in you mind inside its teeming multitudes"". Your city, is that noisy corner of all the worlds, where you could find consolation. It may change a lot, still you could feel that there are things which never change. You could sense the presence of an unseen shadow which always listen to your heart every time you walk amid the crowds. You know how that shadow looks, it has a face, but you could never draw it. For every one who loves their city, this is another classic.","Oct 30, 2015"
2495746,Rebecca,"Now that he has won the much-coveted Nobel Prize, I expected that Orhan Pamuk's best works are all behind him. He does not have to write well anymore - he can just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. After all, the hard work has borne its fruits.. However, he proved me wrong in his new book ""A Strangeness of My Mind,"" which is longlisted in the 2016 International Man Booker Prize. The book is essentially a chronicle of changes in modern Istanbul, as seen from the eyes of Mevlut, who moved to Istanbul from a rural Anatolian village at the age of 12 to further his study (middle school) and helped his father sold yogurt and boza (an alcoholic beverage with a very low alcohol content that originated from the Ottoman era; it is sold by street vendor who would carry jugs of boza from a pole stick placed on their shoulders).. Thus Mevlut took us on a very intimate journey through Istanbul poorest neighborhoods in the 1970's, introducing us to the citizens of the city, who had their own quirks and peculiarities. Essentially, this novel is historical in nature, but all facts (Istanbul redevelopment, electricity privatization, elections after elections, political riots, changes in the masses' political leanings, 9/11, etc.) are weaved seamlessly without being forced. In the end, the novel is all about Mevlut, and the streets of Istanbul that he had (walked and) loved so much for more than 40 years.. This book is homage by Pamuk, a true Istanbul resident who does not only love his city, but knows every nook and cranny along the meandering cobblestone streets.","Apr 28, 2016"
10169502,Bethany Fair,"Having read his previous memoir ISTANBUL, it was fascinating to see Pamuk impose his impressions of the city onto a fictional narrative about a poor boza seller who suffers ""a strangeness is his mind,"" or a sense of growing isolation as he watches the cultural and political tides rapidly turn in a city he once saw a shining beacon of hope. The concept of hüzün is particularly pronounced here as Mevlut's melancholy perfectly reflects the sadness that comes of living amid the ruins of a lost empire. In many ways, Mevlut's life story is written as a profoundly detailed micro-history, representing the lost histories of Istanbul's street vendors and the complicated yet beautiful lives they lived, hidden beneath the triumphant stories of nationalist grandeur. Mevlut's life is a palimpsest which Pamuk expertly uncovers from under the veil of Turkish modernism which has served to both silence and even erase the lives of the poor who defined the city in all its complexity.. While the story starts slow, my love for Mevlut grew so much that by the end of the book, I couldn't help but cry. Truly a stunning masterpiece of the heart.","May 05, 2016"
1067741,Susan,"I enjoyed this book though it took me awhile. It's a book you sink into, not so much recommended for those who don't care for sprawling, immersive, simmering stories. It took me about 100 pages to accomplish this ""sinking into"" by which time I was committed and entranced by Mevlut's story of an Istanbul both disappearing and emerging. The city of Istanbul here is as much a character as Mevlut himself. Not knowing much about Turkey, I found the book enlightening, if a bit overmuch on the yoghurt and boza. Though Mevlut remains politically uncommitted, he witnesses firsthand the conflicts between east and west, Islamist and nationalist, history and progress. And most of all, when he's wandering the streets selling boza, he's suffused with melancholy, with a pervasive ""strangeness"" in his mind, not unlike the metaphorical miasma of Dickens' foggy London. If Mevlut's passivity keeps him from breaking out of poverty and embracing change, he is nonetheless a sympathetic, lovable witness to the erosion of tradition with an artist's soul.","Nov 01, 2016"
19407398,Nam Pham,"As a vendor so stubbornly sticking to the streets of Istanbul, Mevlut became the witness of the many dividers that constantly destroyed and created lives in the city - including of his own.. On one level, we see the clash of religions, cultures and classes as flows of people come in and out of Istanbul days and nights. On another level, the novel so brilliantly draws out the lines between public and private thoughts, between heart and words and above all - between one's intent, one's action and his fate.. How could we say what we mean? how could we ever make clear of what our hearts want in this mixed-up reality of the city? How could we be happy with what life gives you as if we can ever make sense of what it has given you?","Jan 21, 2017"
723708,Joel,"This book is different to what I have read previously of Orhan Pamuk - whereas in Snow, Kara Kitap, White Castle, Istanbul and Masumiyet Muzesi Pamuk writes about members of the intellectual elite or the bourgeoisie, in this story he writes about migrants from the village. The book is also a lot more reliant on narrative than on the sleights of hand around identity which characterised Kara Kitap and the White Castle. Still a beautiful read about a city I love, and a great introduction for anyone unfamiliar with the modern history of Istanbul as to how it has developed over the past fifty years.","Oct 29, 2015"

Very interesting situation - the girl is the older sister of the girl he thought he was writing the letters to - his cousin had given him the wrong name. The story is epic.

Not once, but millions of times, again, again and again, noticing all small changes that, with the flow of years build up to something unrecognisable, but still so fully yours. This is a beautiful ode to flâneurism and a very good one.. Besides there's a story of a man who goes with a flow, through good and bad times, though maybe it's the everything that passes through him. Things come and go, he keeps on walking through the streets of Istanbul, lost in his own thoughts. It's not according to the rules, you are supposed to follow dreams, build a fortune, reach the top of the mountain - for Mevlut, this all seems to be inexistent, or just pass by together with everything else. Is he less happy because of that? Not at all. On the contrary, that's the one person in a whole book who's always somehow more or less appreciates what he has and goes on in sorta zen mode, happy and looking forward to the bright future.. What's more, the book is a good window to Turkey and to Istanbul. The culture, the customs and the development on country and its biggest city. From our point of view many things in Turkey might be seen as unacceptable and alien - the easiest example would be matchmaking tradition and keeping the idea that ""the real love is when you marry first, and get to know each other"". I think one of the major values of this book is to show everything through the eyes of simple people, who don't question their customs much and generally, just tries to live their lives in the best way they know and can. It gives a perspective, expands horizons and is another pleasure of the book.. Finally, the storytelling itself. No wonder Pamuk got Nobel for his writing. He knows his craft well.","Feb 26, 2018"

39252250,Kelsi H,"Please check out all of my reviews at. http://ultraviolentlit.blogspot.ca. !. I have loved some of Nobel Prize Winner Orhan Pamuk’s novels (Snow, My Name is Red), but recently I have read a couple that I did not enjoy as much. Pamuk’s work all seems to have a similar tone and atmosphere, with a narrative voice that blurs together between books – and all of them star the city of Istanbul. On reading other reviews of this latest novel, I have noticed that people enjoyed it most when they had read other books by Pamuk – as if this new book is enhanced by his body of work as a whole. I do think that his books create layers of description, setting and voice; that being said, I wouldn’t recommend this book as the first one to read, although I still really enjoyed it.. A Strangeness in My Mind is organized using an interesting technique: the main narrative flow is interrupted by snippets of first person commentary, as if these characters are being interviewed by the author. Later in the novel, the narration is taken over completely by these multiple characters. At first I did not like the style of writing, but it grew on me, and became more interesting towards the end. Having multiple perspectives of the same event is always fun for catching out unreliable narrators.. The novel tells the story of Mevlut, a young man who comes to Istanbul from the Turkish countryside, determined to make his fortune as a street vendor. He has many jobs throughout his long life, but the most meaningful is his work selling boza, a traditional fermented drink. In addition to the creative narration, the novel jumps around in time: in Part One we are told in only a few pages that Mevlut was once in love with a girl he had never met, and he wrote her love letters for three years. He decides to elope with her in secret – and that is when he realizes that the girl he was writing to is actually his future wife’s sister. In the next several sections, these events and the time leading up to them are all examined in detail.. The remainder of the book leads us through Mevlut’s life, including a feeling of “strangeness” that seems to continually haunt him. He grows to love his accidental wife and their two daughters, but he always feels that something is missing. Moving from job to job, searching for meaning in politics and religion, Mevlut tells his wife, “[t]here is a strangeness in my mind…[n]o matter what I do, I feel completely alone in this world.” (P. 228) He feels different from everyone else – but then, who doesn’t?. This is a coming-of-age story that lasts a lifetime, with Mevlut constantly trying to find himself. Through Mevlut’s wandering the city streets as a boza vendor, it is also an exploration of the city of Istanbul, and its continual evolution. The city witnessed the movement from traditional rural life to modern urban living, changing the socio-political situation in Turkey throughout the twentieth century. These changes have culminated most recently in the influx of Syrian refugees. Mevlut, and by extension the city of Istanbul, attempt to reconcile modern life with the long history of the city – the familiar streets become strange as they rapidly change.. Mevlut learns to adapt with his city. He sees it for what it is – his is not a misty-eyed adoration of Istanbul, but he loves it regardless. He also learns to balance his public and private lives, showing one self to the world, and keeping his “strangeness” inside his mind. He is aware of the compromises in his life, and he finds ways to live with them. One metaphor for this is his selling of boza: it is a fermented, mildly-alcoholic drink, yet people deny this and drink it anyway. Mevlut’s friend argues that “boza is just something someone invented so Muslims could drink alcohol, it’s booze in disguise – everyone knows that.” (P. 269) Yet Mevlut is happy to lie and tell people it is non-alcoholic, thus taking the sin onto himself.. Pamuk tells Mevlut’s story in simple language, which is best to record the complex plot and multiple main characters. The novel can be read on so many levels, and it is enhanced with new ways of looking at Mevlut’s life story. I am enjoying it more as I reflect over its many layers, and I highly recommend Pamuk’s work as a whole.. I received this novel from Knopf Books and Goodreads First Reads in exchange for an honest review.","Jan 01, 2016"
3902989,Ulfah,"After being traumatized reading the Museum of Innocence, I still somehow want to indulge myself to read Orhan Pamuk's work again. There's just a sense of magnetism to keep on coming back to his home city Istanbul. And when I read the general plot of the story, I was simply hooked. Hoping, please, don't let it be too hurtful this time.. And oh boy.. I have to write back a little on Museum of Innocence to be able to put my thoughts properly here. Museum of Innocence tells a story about a rich Istanbul man who fell in love with his distant, somewhat poor cousin, Füsun. Throughout their relationship, he grew obsessive, following and setting her up for his advantage and by the end of the book, I was so mad and stressed, and I can't figure out why some people can say that this is a romantic love story. Ugh.. So I was slightly worried, but curious at the same time, when I found out that the central theme of A Strangeness in My Mind is a love story as well. But it turns out that it has have an opposite atmosphere compare to Museum of Innocence.. The two books have some similarities, though. In addition for both being set up in Istanbul, the story tells about the changes the characters experienced in relation to the development of politics within the decades when they lived in Istanbul. Funny enough, while Museum of Innocence delved inside the life of Istanbul's upper class where it's more 'Western' dominated, A Strangeness in My Mind is being told from the eyes of the more poor (very very poor), traditional, lower classes, migrants from villages part of Istanbul. I have to check, but maybe the two books are actually set in the West (Museum of Innocence) and the East (A Strangeness in My Mind) sides of the city?. So the book tells about a boza seller, Mevlut, who came from a village near Istanbul trying to make a living in the big city, starting when he was a young 12 years old boy. It further described about Mevlut and the dynamics of his family - dad, cousins, uncle, aunt, best friend - and later on his wife, his in-laws, children, nieces, nephews, as they struggle to survive, and how Istanbul's landscape changes from the 1950s towards 2012. There's of course the whole political situation, both within the country and outside, used as a background or sometimes directly affecting the characters. The book described (mostly in a fun way) of the life and culture of Turkish people, and the different people who lived there, and how they clashed, or get together.. Anyways, as I've mentioned about the atmosphere of the book, I couldn't help myself to be so comforted along the reading experience. Sure, it's so stressful to see the main character, honest boyish looking, Boza selling, Mevlut, working throughout his whole life trying to make ends meet by working various jobs with such optimism and earnestness. Or the people around his life who are simply ordinary people with the greatness and complexity of human beings. But while Museum of Innocence left me feeling depressed, this book comforts me about the reality of a changing life, of being young, falling in love, growing older, the relativeness of success, of happiness, of what home means, of how changes are unavoidable, and the fleeting lives of our species, and how time waits for no man. This book have so many ways to make the readers sad and depressed, but through Mevlut's heart and his soft feelings, you'd be comforted knowing that kindness and love can cure your heart.. The nights when Mevlut walks down the old small streets in Istanbul, carrying his boza drink, knocking peoples' doors, listening to their story and peeking on their lives; the comfort of knowing that you have loved and shared blissful years with your beloved, going home to a place where your heart can rest; when you can be comforted by the quiteness of the night, taking a refuge from the craziness of the world under daylight; for all that, I just need to say, thank you Mr Pamuk for writing such a wonderful story. Thank you for letting us know about Mevlut's life and the amazing people around him. Especially, Rayiha. It's always been her.","Apr 21, 2016"
537680,Katie,"Now that I've finished this book, the first thing I want to do is homebrew some boza. Unless anyone can suggest a local boza proprietor?. Do you know how there are authors whose books are all exactly alike? (One person that comes to mind if Kurt Vonnegut. I love him, but I can't usually remember which events are from which novels because they seem that they could have happened in any one of them. Add to that the fact that he recycles jokes and phrases, which is actually totally adorable in his hands.). Anyway, Orhan Pamuk is not one of those writers. Whereas ""Museum of Innocence"" was about the lives of the super-rich, ""A Strangeness in My Mind"" is about the lives of poor migrant workers who leave the village to live on the fringes of Istanbul. And then, as more migrants pour in, what once was the fringe becomes part of the city. It is as much about the rapid development and swelling and sprawling of Istanbul as it is about the human characters. In fact, one of the nicest parts in when Mevlut has a realization (he wonders if he is the only one who has ever had it and wonders if it is a blessing that ""god"" has specifically bestowed on him) that the streets he wanders at night while selling boza, with all their particularities that he is so fond of, are the same as the twists and turns of his mind. If I remembered where the sentence was, I'd give it to you instead of my garbled version, but there it is.. So there's a lot about the history of Istanbul and meanwhile it follows the life of Mevlut from middle school to retirement. Unlike ""Snow"" which has that magical ambiguous ending (I think an ending that is ambiguous without pissing readers/viewers off is probably one of the hardest things to craft), this book has a definitive ending. It ends with (fear not, I won't spell it out exactly) Mevlut deciding the one thing that he would most like to say to the city as he contemplates the graffiti on the walls recalling that he once contributed political slogans and posters to these walls in his youth. And what he says refers to the way that the merits of strange accidents of fate, and even what seem to be disappointments, can't be evaluated until long after they've passed. This makes me want to close this review from a quote by Kurt Vonnegut, but as I don't remember where this quote is from either, I'll totally make it up: ""We don't know what the good in life was until it's over.""","Jul 21, 2016"
18017496,Niloufar-Lily Soltani,"It took me two months to finish this 584 page book. With my busy life, I think it was fast enough and I enjoyed every moment of it. I have been living with Mevlut for a couple of months now and it’s really hard to let him go.. Mevlut always wanted to understand this strangeness in his mind and he took me to this journey from Anatoila to Istanbul to Ismir, to Duttepe Mosque and Kultepe, from 1970s to today. I have never been in those places but because of where I come from, everything was familiar to me, names, places, food, and culture .. I heard someone once said that we are all molded by our cultures. Is this is a true statement? I don’t know if everyone is, but I know Mevlut was. He was growing up with these traditions that he respected so much, but at the same time he resisted naturally. As a young man, he resisted sex and encountering with women because of the fear of what he was told by his religion. Even masturbation was forbidden. He had to keep busy selling his boza and thinking about an image of a woman he created in his mind. An image his friends let him create and then even write love letters to.. Mevlut was not Ferhat. While Ferhat dynamically lived and made changes, Mevlut made observations. He only wanted to sell his boza , and make love to his beloved wife and be a good father.. I laughed a lot while reading this book . Mevlut made me laugh. His encounters with his friend, people on street, with love, his wife, Samiha, his daughters, and at the end money and settling in old age. They all made me laugh and sigh at the same time.. Women in this book each present different women from the same culture. Rayhia was the centre of the book. She was a phenomenon character and what happened to her is something that is under described and not enough portrayed in this world and thankfully finally Pamuk touched on that too. Samiha’s character, this young beauty is very complex. From the view point of Rayhia , the reader envies Samiha, her beauty and her power over men in her life, until Samiha herself speaks about her life, and then the reader knows how unhappy she has lived .. Pamuk’s style of multi narrative prose is fascinating. He has used this style in “My Name is Red” too . It reveals different viewpoints artistically.. I have to also admire and appreciate the translation of this book to English. Ekin Oklap has captured Pamuk’s humour precisely.","Mar 12, 2017"
27708371,Laila,"The book gets you immersed in life in Turkey with all its minute details as perceived through the eyes of its intricately described characters. It is a fiction that takes place amid real life political, economic and social events. I liked it more towards the second half. An interesting feature is how many cultural norms that started in Turkey are also pursued in Egypt which was part of the Ottoman empire for a long time. Overall, it is an enjoyable read.","Feb 04, 2018"
29709008,How_sven,"I'm unsure what to think of this book. Part of me loves that Pamuk has branched out from his comfort zone. Pamuk isn't read as much in Turkey as he is internationally, for a number of reasons. One of which is that many Turks feel that Pamuk writes about a Turkey that is alien to them: wealthy, elitist, Westernized. In A Strangeness in My Mind, however, Pamuk talks about street vendors and Anatolian peasants who migrated to Istanbul from their villages. It's nice to see Pamuk talking about a different side of Istanbul, but as he's branched into different territory, it doesn't ring with the same lyricism that his other novels do. What I love about Pamuk's prose is the way that he can so aptly capture feelings like loneliness, alienation or melancholy, in such a way that you almost have to put the book down after reading certain sentences. Unfortunately, I never felt that way in this one.. Something else that bothers me about this book - yet at the same time I'm happy for, is Pamuk addressing social issues in this book. His other works mostly deal with the Istanbul that Pamuk knows - the wealthy elite. Here, however, he goes into women's issues and patriarchy, corruption and the dirty money that flows through Istanbul's concrete sprawl.. After living in Turkey for a number of years and following Turkish politics closely, I've realized with dismay how careful Pamuk is with whatever he says to the media and regarding politics. It seems that he never says anything about politics until it's been deemed fashionable or beneficial for him to do so. Almost as if in saying anything politically he does so to cultivate a public persona for himself. This book, to me, feels slightly like that. He has been criticized for writing about a very narrow subject matter, and this book is a deviation from that - and while I welcome the change, I wonder if the reason for doing so is more about managing a public image than genuinely caring about the issues the book deals with.","Nov 09, 2015"
7978130,Kartik Tripathi,"Came very close to overtaking The Museum of Innocence as my favourite Pamuk of all time.. I concede that the narrative seemed slow towards the beginning of the book, I abandoned it a little over halfway through when I first bought the (vulgarly gorgeous!) hardback in December '15. I came back only recently, and I am glad I did.. Pamuk lends life to Istanbul - his city, his muse - through a pantheon of characters who act first-person narrators in turn, alternating with an omniscient third person. This device was very gratifying, in how it highlighted the shades of grey to every character - how the same gestures held different meanings for different people, how the same utterances were received with entirely different connotations. In addition, Pamuk's intimate, insightful understanding of the complexity of human emotions, and the inevitable sense of futility in life, of ennui - stands out as clearly in Strangeness as it does in almost all his works.. Mevlut's life intertwines with a history of Istanbul in a beautiful way. The picture of Istanbul that emerges, a city bursting at the seams as Turkey makes a staggeringly rapid transition into an urban society, is very human. Strangeness is a history of the city through the smorgasbord of subtle meanings and sentiments each single alleyway, each single rice-and-chicken seller, every last paved stone square in the older quarters of the town hold for its denizens.. I think Pamuk's writing splits into two distinct groups, the magic realist titles led by My Name is Red, and the realist(?) works, like Museum and this one. I've tried very hard to cultivate a taste for magic realism, partly motivated by wanting to be able to enjoy Pamuk's other works as much as I liked Museum, but I simply can't muster enough willpower. I'm super glad Pamuk made this concession to fans like me, and here's hoping his next title falls in the same broad category.","Jun 02, 2016"
4922926,Elise,"I am Mevlut and Mevlut is me! I share protagonist, Mevlut's nostalgic, romantic strangeness of mind and his love of the city. Mevlut relishes being an urban wanderer, which his occupation as a boza seller allows him, even long after most of the city of Istanbul sleeps. Pamuk's use of the literary motif of the flaneur seems strikingly appropriate since Mevlut's Istanbul in A Strangeness in My Mind shares so many similarities with 19th century industrial Europe. However, Pamuk uses this trope in a somewhat ironic way, since Mevlut is anything but a man of leisure. I feel there is a richness and a statement made in that irony contrasting East vs. West. There are so many things to love about this epic coming-of-age story of Mevlut, poor street vendor of the fermented drink, boza, but Mevlut is poor only in financial terms. In other ways, he lives a rich and wonderful life. The Strangeness in My Mind was part historical novel, part love story, and of course, an unforgettable Bildungsroman. I love how Pamuk brings to life not only the rapidly changing landscape of Istanbul, but also the inner landscape of Mevlut's mind, that of a dreamer, a lover, a father, and a man of principle in a world that is changing in ways he sometimes has trouble accepting. I learned a great deal about Turkish culture, the strife between the Turks and the Kurds, and how real people lived in Istanbul during the second half of the 20th century in these pages. In other words, A Strangeness in My Mind is a great book...the big, sprawling, epic kind you can really lose yourself in. I highly recommend it! This was such a treat--filled with a strong sense of setting and well developed, sympathetic characters--that I have not had my fill of Orhan Pamuk yet. I began reading his Museum of Innocence today. There is a reason Pamuk is a Nobel Prize winner. His books are educational, moving, haunting, and unforgettable!","Jul 03, 2016"
2501002,Deb,"[Book 2 of 25] Orhan Pamuk is one of my favorite authors...but I can never find the words to explain why that is...or to explain how I feel about his books, individually or as a whole. And this time is no different. *A Strangeness in My Mind* is the Nobel Prize (for Literature) winner's latest novel and perhaps the longest one I've read of his so far. That coupled with the craziness of my life the past couple months made getting through this book a challenge...in time only, not in desire or effort.. In those 600 pages, I became quite attached to Mevlut and his immediate and extended family and his friends (and an array of other acquaintances and ""characters"")...and the Istanbul of his childhood seen through his eyes and his mind. And watching both Mevlut and the city (and country) grow and change was a fascinating journey to be a part of.. They say that a sign of a great book is when you turn the final page and gasp that there are no more words...no more story...no more people...no more world. I can't remember how long it's been since I've felt that catch of breath at the last page, paragraph, sentence of a book, but I felt it today. At the turn of that page, we leave Mevlut at an undisclosed but recent date...sometime within the last couple of years...and the last words we hear him speak, only to himself, are a revelation to him, but not to us. And they are anything but a strangeness in his mind. And it is his revelatory discovery, after the lifetime we've shared with him but with so much more life left in him, that ultimately triggers our gasp at the emptiness with the final turned page.. Already he has lived at least a few more years, but we haven't experienced it with him, witnessed it, reveled in it, as we did his first 50+ years. And that causes a strangeness in our minds...and an emptiness in our hearts.","Nov 30, 2015"

1952442,Sharman Wilson,"My husband and I spent two weeks in Turkey in the summer of 2013. We stayed in Istanbul for a few days, then flew east to the Black Sea city of Trabzon, where we were hosted by the Turkish family of one of my husband's students. We rented a car and drove south and west through central Turkey and north back up to Istanbul. We got a real taste of this fascinating and beautiful country (both literally and figuratively) and made friends with some wonderful people. When I heard about this book on NPR, I wanted to read it as a way of reconnecting with Turkey--the places, the language, and the culture. I was not disappointed! I listened to the Audible book, and I loved hearing the sounds of the language again. I recognized the names of places I'd been and allusions to historical events and people. All of that drew me in and added to my enjoyment of the story. The story itself is very human, with fleshed-out characters trying to make a living and form relationships, opinions, and connections to their country and especially to the city of Istanbul. In fact, Istanbul plays such a huge role in the story that it feels like a major character. It grows and changes in size and personality as the years pass, right along with the human characters. As I watched events unfold and saw how people's words and actions affected each other's lives, my emotions were all over the map--affection, frustration, revulsion, anger, empathy, sadness, dread, hope, and incredulity. I felt these same emotions watching the interplay between the transient inhabitants and the legendary city. We can build up or we can destroy, live in harmony or in contention.","Dec 05, 2015"
13431039,Sarah,"Thanks to Goodreads and the publisher for a free copy! A Strangeness in my Mind is an absolutely gorgeous read. In particular, I want to talk/gush about two aspects: the writing style, and the sense of place.. In a work of this length, writing style is so important for drawing the reader in and through the book, and Orhan Pamuk has a beautiful writing style (as does the translator, Ekin Oklap). This book is dense, there is not much dialogue, and it forces you to slow down and savour the words. This is a long read, and it. feels. like a long read, but I mean that as a compliment. You can't speed through this and, really, why would you want to?. One of my favourite things has to be the narration, though. From the first chapter, the narrator sometimes stops to address the reader (which is something that I adore in fiction). As the book continues, various characters interrupt the narrative to correct points, elaborate on various events, or simply provide a narration of their own. It doesn't feel like the story is jumping around, though. It feels like these characters are sitting in a room and telling you the story, each chiming in with their own details.. My favourite thing, though, would have to be the sense of place. I especially love Mevlut's childhood in Istanbul, but all of it is so vivid. Pamuk brilliantly immerses the reader in Turkey's culture and history, along with various issues that the characters face.. This book breathes. I can't think of a better way to describe it.","Sep 22, 2015"
16927889,Jaap,"When the young boy Mevlut travels from central Anatolia to Istanbul in 1969 to help his father, the city counts about 2 million inhabitants. When Mevlut is in his fifties the count has reached more than 11 million. Pamuk's book is not only a beautifully slow description of the way the city landscape changes but it is also a great lovestory about Mevlut and his ""unexpected"" bride Rayiha. Oldfashioned and too honest for his surroundings, Mevlut misses out on all opportunites to improve himself and at the end of the book he is still the poor ""Boza seller"", just like his father was. But after a life of observing and walking the streats of the sprawling city, Mevlut's ""richness"" is better developed than with most of his relatives and friends.. I just love the book. Its slow pace and deep insights make me feel happy. And although Mevlut is too shy and withdrawn to make a flashy hero, he still is so sympathetic that it is hard to find another book with the same level of identification.. What I also like very much about the style is that the main characters address the reader directly. It's just like you are reading a series of letters commenting on the story from different perspectives, a great experience !","May 23, 2017"
1889531,Evelyn,"I visited Istanbul in 1998 and again when I read this book. I enjoyed being immersed in Melvut's world. I learned a bit about the complicated politics of Turkey and the Middle East and also about the marriage customs of the Islamic world. I wish I'd had a map of Istanbul to better visualize the different communities where Melvut sold his booza.. Pamuk says this "" I strongly feel that the art of the novel is based on the human capacity, though it’s a limited capacity, to be able to identify with “the other.” Only human beings can do this. It requires imagination, a sort of morality, a self-imposed goal of understanding this person who is different from us, which is a rarity."" I think he achieved his goal in this book.. The novel reminded me of a Dickens' tale. Melvut was the melancholy hero who made the best of his life despite being tricked by family members and friends. He had a strangeness in his mind- ""no matter what I do, I feel completely alone in this world""- but his love for Rayiha and selling booza made his life worthwhile in the end.","Jan 28, 2016"
13192044,Zvi Volk,"I usually find Pamuk difficult for one of several reasons. For instance, after reading The Museum of Innocence I was sure Pamuk is a deeply troubled person. I found Snow far too depressing. If I want to be depressed I can read/watch the news. A Strangeness in My Mind is altogether different. It's a long book and it meanders. But I never got the feeling of being bored or lost. It also has a cast of characters that is reminiscent of a Hollywood extravaganza. But in this book everyone has a clear role and they fit together. The main character is portrayed in abundant detail and much sympathy. Pamuk is telling a highly personal story that takes place in Istanbul, but in this case, it's as if he writing about a Middle Eastern (or at least a Turkish) everyman. I came away with a feeling of satisfaction. And with insights about Turkey and Istanbul as well as their development over the last 50 years.. All in all, I like this book a lot.. For what it's worth I read it in paperback.","Feb 04, 2017"
7381993,Katia N,"Another amazingly original, poetic and nostalgic novel from Pamuk, where the main character is Istanbul. This time he looks at the city through the eyes of a street seller. And the way how he treats his characters with love, respect and the absence of prejudices affects the way how you read it and changes some of your perceptions, at least in my case.. A quote:. ""With astonishing consistency, the people of Kutlepe and Duttepe all saw the same figures in their dreams, at regular intervals:. Boys: the female primary-school teacher. Girls: Ataturk. Men: the Holy Prophet Muhammad. Women: a tall, anonymous Western fim star. Old Men: an angle drinking milk. Old Women: a young postman bringing good news""","Nov 11, 2015"
27262778,Shuprova,"Pamuk does it again. Another beautiful love letter to Istanbul characterised by his own unique style of writing. Although this story spans over a considerable amount of time, a whole lifetime in fact, it still has the same pace of his usual stories - where you feel like not a lot happens, but you get so involved in this person's life that you can't help following his thoughts and understanding his ups and downs as if they were your own. This novel is a simple story of a simple man, but it is also a story of change and the struggle of daily life. While it carries with it a certain poignant nostalgia, it is also filled with love and humour, and the ever-optimistic protagonist Mevlut is a character you can't help but root for. All in all, a wonderful read.","Dec 29, 2015"

After finishing this book, I feel that I have come to understand another dimension of life in Turkey, and especially the history of mass immigration to Istanbul from all corners of the republic. Again this novel is merely revolving around Turkey's complex clash of ideologies and beliefs without the writers looking down on any of the different perspectives or beliefs of any of the characters in this novel. Pamuk has been creating an Istanbul in my head to which the real version might only be a disappointment.

It was only Orhan Pamuk’s name that got me till 200 pages. Otherwise I wouldn’t have bothered after 50 pages. Maybe people of other nations may find the Turkey described as “exotic”.

The book is well written and create a good sense of the city with neat descriptions. However Mevlut, the main character, is relatively plain and with no aspiration (for his own admission), with a ""strangeness in his mind"" that the author repeats once and again without really justifying it. There is a general lack of depth and emotions, reducing the book to a telling of the events that happen in Mevlut's life. The historical happening is intrusive and forced at times, and so do the parts where the other characters suddenly feel the need to talk as interviewed.","Mar 06, 2019"

Bought and began reading this epic journey through the backstreets of Istanbul while I was in Istanbul, walking the very streets that Mevlut walked. Really helped bring his story to life in a way that I'm not sure other readers would experience. There's a lovely, haunting strain that runs through the novel; but I still felt like a needed a stronger emotional connection. Just felt a little empty at the end, perhaps not unlike the working class of Istanbul who are rapidly losing their connection to this amazing city on the hill.","Jan 08, 2016"

The writing is good, there is a real feeling for the time and place. There is so much I like about this book, yet it is dragging on. I think it may just be too long, and in need of some editing.

The plot is so empty, it is not worthy of being a 600 page novel so the boredom thrives on excessive, overindulgent ramblings that the reader can barely care about. Like the exhaustive page-after-page detail on how the hero discovers masturbation, and it eventually feels as if this is his sole achievement in life. These ramblings are so punishing that when the author kills off two of the main characters towards in the end of the plot, in a hurried attempt to connect the dots in this vacuous story (there is basically no story), I was almost relieved!","Jan 21, 2017"

At the same time, they're distinctly Turkish. I have to confess to being pretty ignorant of Turkish culture going into this novel. The descriptions of Istanbul and the life that goes on within it are rich and very different from my own life. But at the same time, what makes this book so beautiful is the visceral reaction that comes from recognizing the same human experience, love, compassion, frustration, confusion - the full range of emotion - that we all go through. This is an unforgettable novel.","Mar 23, 2017"

Pamuk alternates narration in 3rd person and various 1st person perspectives, always doing a good job of informing the reader from whose perspective he is narrating. I also enjoyed that he would often tell the reader what was going to happen and then explain how it happened, showing respect for the reader rather than an attempt to manipulate emotions.","Apr 26, 2016"

While many would pass him without ever noticing his simple and unassuming existence, the hero of this story possesses a sensitive soul that is worth knowing. While we follow The main character in the streets of Istanbul, we become familiar of the nature of the city and how urbanization, mismanagement, and steady stream of poor immigrants are continuously reshaping it.","Aug 09, 2017"
8529726,Carlos Ahumada,"This is storytelling at its best! Pamuk finds in the ordinary the extraordinary. He touches upon very deep topics in a subtle way such as love, fate, religion, destiny, success, work ethics, politics and loneliness. This is not a book that surprises you as you turn the page. However, it surprises you as a whole. Once you are done and reflect a bit on what happened, you can identify in many ways with Mevlut, the main character, and realise that at the end we are all very similar no matter where and when we have lived.

2309191,thewanderingjew,"This tale revolves around three families: Mevlut’s father Mustafa’s, Mustafa's older brother Hasan’s, and Rayiha’s father, Crooked Neck Abdurrahman’s. Although this story is written from their many different points of view, and it follows the lives and schemes of these men and their children, this is really the story of Mevlut over a period of almost half a century. A series of lies and deceptions sets this tale into motion. The first deception involves Mustafa’s brother, Hasan, and the family land that he deceitfully used to arrange the marriage of his son Korkut to Crooked Neck’s daughter, Vediha. The second involves Hasan’s son Süleyman and his falsehearted treatment of Mevlut regarding Crooked Neck’s daughters Rayiha and Samiha. The novel takes place in Turkey and along with Mevlut’s life, the reader bears witness to the changes in politics, government and civil rights that occurred during the four and a half decades in which it transpired from some time in the year 1968 when 12 year old Mevlut and his father move to Istanbul, through 2012, when Mevlut has revelations about the love of his life and his eternal need to sell Boza.. When the story began, we learned that helped by his cousin Süleyman, Mevlut believed he was eloping with the girl of his dreams, Samiha, the girl with the dark eyes that he fell in love with at first sight, at Korkut and Vediha's wedding, the young and beautiful girl that he thought he had been writing love letters to over the past few years. We discovered that instead, Korkut's brother, Süleyman, had actually tricked Mevlut into eloping with the older and plainer sister, Rayiha. Compassionate Mevlut discovered that there was, after all, an inner beauty as well as an outer beauty, and he honored his end of the bargain by marrying Rayiha, choosing not to humiliate her or to break her heart, and he proceeded to fall deeply in love with her. They were suited to each other perfectly. The time was September, 1982. The novel then continued, moving back and forth in time until decades later, in 2012.. Mevlut’s father, Mustafa, was a street vendor who sold yogurt by day and Boza by night. Boza is an ancient, thick, pudding-like traditional beverage of the Ottoman Empire. Mustafa made Mevlut his own stick with which to carry the jugs across his shoulders, and often, in the evenings after he had done his schoolwork, he was allowed to sell Boza with his father. Mevlut loved their time together. When he grew up, however, he disappointed his father by becoming a Boza seller too, giving up on furthering his education. As the technology and changes in the politics and government occurred, the reader watched the effects these outside forces had on Mevlut and those with whom he interacted. Corruption was rampant and lying and conniving appeared to be the norm, in all walks of life, with the most cunning and greedy bullies getting away with taking advantage of their neighbors and fellow employees. The terrible poverty forced people to do what they must in order to survive, even resorting to stealing electricity for their homes and cheating one another. Some women began to resent the power the men had over their narrow lives, and they sometimes schemed in order to gain some little bit of independence, even just to enable them to leave their own homes freely.. In spite of the changes around him, Mevlut somehow managed to hold true to the basic values his father had taught him. He always looked backwards in time and yearned for the old ways, for his former, more simple life. He did not engage in crafty activities. He felt little envy or greed. In spite of all his hardships, his faith remained. On occasion, he visited the Holy Man for advice, but he did not pray regularly. He maintained his ties to the past by selling his Boza every night. It brought him contentment. The call of the Boza seller was a traditional sound that roused residents, and they would shout from their windows to invite him; they were overcome with a feeling of nostalgia for this ancient custom that he loved so much and vowed to continue all the days of his life. In addition to selling his Boza, however, it was sometimes necessary for him to hold other jobs as the world around him changed and commercial competition made it less profitable to simply sell his Boza. At times, among other things, he was an electrical inspector and a building manager, positions often fortuitously secured for him by friends and family.. The book described Istanbul’s growing pains as the government changed, as religion became a more important part of its function and as technology affected the more mundane existence of everyday life with television, multi-floored apartment buildings, better transportation, improved services and electric power, and other assorted developments that came as a natural byproduct of the country’s entry into modernity. Mevlut continued to prefer the grass to the concrete, the family and friends to the strangers, and simplicity to the complexity of modern day life. While progress improved his daily life, it created distance and troubles between people. There seemed to be a growing culture of corruption. Little lies led to bigger ones. Small tricks led to greater deceptions and sometimes life became more dangerous. All authority seemed to be a bit corrupt and success went to the most devious, power hungry among them.. The author painted a picture of Turkish life as Istanbul morphed into a more modern city, while at the same time, he illuminated Mevlut’s constant desire to keep his world the same. The modern world, with all of its benefits, did not really intrigue him. Because he had walked the streets singing out Boza, and because he had entered the homes of strangers, he bore witness to the political and religious changes taking place as Turkey moved more and more into the modern world. He also witnessed the corruption, the betrayals, the bullies, the gangs, the lying and the deceitful behavior that were the negative side effects of this modernizing, as people driven by greed and a desire for power often resorted to unethical behavior. He too, had ample opportunity to get richer and engage in dishonorable behavior, but he resisted temptation, maintained his father’s values and steadily plodded along, never wishing to hurt or cheat anyone. He saw the way in which the ancient ways and the modern began to coexist, sometimes comfortably and sometimes in chaos as one group or another tried to gain the advantage. He preferred the old ways to the new.. In the end, Mevlut always wondered if the strangeness in his mind simply existed in his head or was in the world around him .The philosophy of the Holy Man, expressed in the words imparted to Mevlut, when he visited with him to seek his help, were prescient. He said, “It does not matter whether your heart intends to pray, the most important thing is to truly pray”. I believe that Mevlut realized that he may have intended to love Samiha in his heart, but he truly loved Rayiha!. The story played out very deliberately and methodically, in an easy going manner that matched Mevlut’s personality. It was neither exciting nor dull, but slow and steady. Sometimes there was a bit too much detail; the descriptions of a particular moment in time, down to the food being eaten, became tedious. Although the audio was read well by the narrator, I would suggest the print copy over the audio since the foreign words and names were not easy to understand.","Dec 27, 2015"
305074,Jaci,"Mevlut arrives in Istanbul with his father and spends the next forty years as a boza seller and doing other jobs. The story of his marriage follows him through these years and even later in life it is a topic of conversation. Pamuk creates a detailed family life for Mevlut and describes the phenomenal changes to Istanbul that Mevlut witnesses with amazement and some regret. Istanbul itself is a character although Mevlut is the most well-developed character I've experienced in a while. Beautifully written, it still took some effort to make it through 599 p.. p.107: In a city, you can be alone in a crowd,and in fact what makes the city a city is that it lets you hide the strangeness in your mind inside its teeming multitudes.. p.438: Those two elderly clerks believed that only by studying this history and learning all of the tricks people had come up with over the years to cheat the government, and only by truly understanding the ins and outs of how they used and paid for their electricity, could an inspector ever hope to get them to pay their bills. ... They soon resolved that they might do better getting me to appeal to our new owners from Kayseri and make them understand that the archives were a crucial and irreplaceable tool for the collection of bills; maybe that would save this vast treasure trove of human ingenuity from destruction.. p.579: So this is how Mevlut came to understand the truth that a part of him had known all along: walking around the city at night made him feel as if he were wandering around inside his own head. That was why whenever to spoke to the walls, advertisements, shadows, and strange and mysterious shapes he couldn't see in the night, he always felt as if he were talking to himself.","Jul 01, 2020"

This was a beautiful book, intertwining the personal story of a bozo seller in the fast-developing city of Istanbul. The book transported me into the Turkish culture with beautiful details such as families dropping their baskets out of the windows to get some bozo, the position of women in turkish households, the development of Istanbul as a modern city,... What touched me the most was the love story between the protagonist and his wife. When the inevitable thing happened to the wife it was painful to read, but the end made up for it.. So happy to have started the year with such a quality read..

Orhan Pamuk managed to highlight the humble life of a street vendor while bringing up various issues such as Architecture, Capitalist, Poverty, and Politics (Left Wing The Marxist and Right Wing The Islamist) in deep understanding..

I enjoyed this book. It's very long and quite slow -- there's not much action or plot. Rather, it's a character-driven story about one boy who grows to a man in Istanbul. It deals with the history, politics, and culture of Turkey and addresses issues such as religion, love, poverty, and power.

7908898,Paul,"A story about a boy growing into manhood in a city that embodies his entire life, a love letter to a city that has steeped it’s authors soul, a love story or a story about family, all of these, or none of them at all? I’m not sure it really matters, A Strangness in My Mind is a beautiful long soak in Istanbul through the life of Mevlut the Boza Seller and his family.. I have been putting off writing this for so long, Pamuk’s masterpiece (that’s my humble opinion, I’m just throwing it out there) left me struggling to work out how I could write what I want to write without just rambling on (like normal really). I listened to an interview with Pamuk on Open Book on Radio 4, to better write this review. I’m at the point now where writing this seems more insurmountable than the book seemed when I first dipped into it’s seven hundred odd pages.. What do I want to write? That after reading Istanbul, I thought Pamuk was a bit weird, but after reading this I want to read more of his fiction (for me he’s the opposite of Paul Theroux, who’s travel books I prefer to his fiction). I love Mevlut. While reading the book I kept thinking that if more people in the world were like him, it would be a better place. Yes there’s a certain lethargy, a lack of ambition, but he thinks of others, he feels, he has a strong sense of family, loyalty, just the right amount of optimism, and above all, hope. His situation at the beginning borders on ridiculous, but his placid acceptance of his fate belies someone who knows himself and knows when perhaps it’s better to quit while you’re winning, and that, deep down, he knew he had in fact won.. They were having a cup of tea at the Mountain View way station, where their bus had stopped for a quick break in the middle of the night, when she finally asked him, “For God’s sake, what’s the matter?”. “There’s a strangeness in my mind,” said Mevlut. “No matter what I do, I feel completely alone in the world.” “You will never feel that way again now that I’m with you,” said Rahiya wither maternal feeling. As Rahiya snuggled up to him, Mevlut watched her dreamlike reflection in the window of the teahouse, and he knew that he would never forget this moment.. I loved the gentle laying out of the story. It is not rushed, allowing the reader, and perhaps Pamuk himself, to linger and savour it. I loved the other characters interrupting the narrator to offer their side of what happened and why they did it. Yet the focus, although sometimes zooming out to Istanbul, never falls far from Mevlut. Out of all them in the end, apart from Mevlut it was Vediha that I loved, that was perhaps the strongest character in the story, who despite being very much in the background, eclipsed both her sisters and did what was best for the family, even if it was not the best for her personally. I will also mention Rahiya, who knows the misdirection but who pours herself into their marriage and children and who supports Mevlut as he moves from job to job, always dreaming of a good income and a nicer house.. A Strangeness in my Mind is a tale of the city through it’s food, kitchens, habits, and it’s street vendors, the yoghurt sellers, Boza sellers, Chicken or rice sellers.. Into a pot of boiling water, he would throw a spoonful of margarine and whatever was left in the fridge, such as carrots, celery and potatoes, as well as a handful of the chilies and bulgur they’d brought from the village, and then he would stand back and listen to the pot bubbling away as he watched the infernal tumult inside. The little bits of potato and carrot whirled around madly like creatures burning in the fires of hell – you could almost hear them wailing in agony from inside the pot – and then there would be sudden unexpected surges, as in volcanic craters, and the carrots and celery would rise up close to Mevlut’s nose.. Starting off as a short novel about a street vendor, Pamuk was soon questioning about where Mevlut had come from, how had he come to Istanbul? The story mushroomed out and while wandering (and wondering) on his Boza rounds, Mevlut is aware of the city changing around him. His stubborn love of tradition offering others a way of maintaining their past, as he calls out his refrain through the night. It is the ideal job for someone who’s mind constantly ponders. The dark empty streets of Istanbul gives Mevlut time to retreat into the strangeness in his mind and to try and make sense of it, sometimes he does, sometimes it eludes him, but for him the enjoyment comes from the wondering, not the knowing.. It’s almost as if while walking his rounds, Mevlut and Istanbul become entwined, and although Mevlut can’t live without Istanbul, he is aware that it will carry on without him.. Their story is the deeply personal story of one person, told through their community, told through their city that will still resonate with any person in any city in the world that has grown through from migration and modernisation, and Pamuk has woven a deeply personal yet also universal story about a street vendor, a city, a family or a love, or all of them, or none at all..

5603048,Jeruen,"Hmm, a. New York Times. reviewer said about this book, that it has ""the stretch of an epic but not the impact of one"". And I think I have to agree. It was a long novel, but somehow it was lacking in the oomph that a 700-something-page novel should have.. See, this novel is about a boy, named Mevlut, who moves to Istanbul, and for the next years and decades, settles down. He is not the most interesting character, really. He is rather timid, doesn't have a lot of conviction, and somehow is always the one who just halfheartedly does things. Passion isn't Mevlut's middle name. Heck, he fell in love to a girl and wrote letters to this girl for three years, and when a girl tries to run away with him so that they can get married, Mevlut goes along, even though he realises that it isn't the girl he fell in love with.. I don't know. I just find his personality irritating. If someone does you wrong, how long will be act like the world's punching bag? When would you start complaining? When an opportunity comes, will you grab it, or will you just stand by watching it sail away? These traits seem to be all encapsulated in Mevlut, and it is definitely not my personality type. It is definitely a personality type that I would eventually get tired of waiting, and sooner or later I will just abandon him by the sidewalk.. I suppose I just don't deal well with people who like to play the victim all the time. So don't blame me if you end up being a street seller all your lifetime. There have been plenty of opportunities to rise the ranks and elevate your social class, but if all you want to do is sell boza on the streets at night, then so be it. Goodbye.. So now I am scratching my head thinking why a novel like this has come out of Orhan Pamuk's brain. But come to think of it, it follows a pattern. I have read several other books of his in the past, and I must say that I used to like them more. Pamuk typically has these novels where there are multiple narrators, and sure enough,. A Strangeness in My Mind. is also narrated by multiple characters, in addition to the omniscient narrator. I also reviewed the previous books I have read, and sure enough, there were characters that were lacking in conviction. I remember. The Black Book. having a character who finds his wife missing one day. Also, in. The Museum of Innocence. , you find a man, Kemal, who becomes madly in love with a woman he cannot reach, so he builds a museum in her memory. Somehow, Pamuk likes to write about weak men, about hopeless romantics, and Mevlut is no different. Mevlut was in love with Samiha, who he thought was named Rayiha, so when the real Rayiha shows up when they planned to elope, he just throws his hands up in the air and goes with it, marrying a woman he never was in love in the first place.. I am not sure I like these characters, moving forward. As I was reading the book, I kept on asking myself, why am I still reading a story about this pathetic character? It was quite boring, frankly speaking.. Anyway, the thing I like the most about this book however is how it provides a wonderful narration on how Istanbul evolved over the years. I haven't been to this city, and reading novels set in the city provides me a vicarious access to it. That is definitely something I appreciated. But overall, I am not too enthusiastic about this novel. Only read it if you're a die-hard fan of Pamuk. I give it 2 out of 5 stars.. See my other book reviews. here. .","Apr 16, 2018"
69839858,Kookaburra,"A powerful coming-of-age plot for both a city and a man that captures you from the start. Indeed, this lengthy love story, beautifully written and researched, embraces the Turkish culture and its traditions. But with an almighty awakening into a new age of modernism, borne from the West, we still hear, only just, that alluring song in the streets, ""Boo-zaa"".. The culture of course is vastly different from our own in the West, particularly here in Australia. Our protagonist, the Boza seller Mevlut, represents tradition, a past, a history, a yearning for once was, a desire to maintain it into the future.. Scrupulously devoted to his vending trade he, as we, enjoy the interactions of the people he meets, especially the Holy Guide in his later years, but the fear of what’s lurking around the alleys and corners is always present in the form of snarling dogs barring teeth and ferocious barks, often muddy coloured or black dogs (is this depression?)….signifying the growing unethical corruption in Instanbul, his cousins included.. It’s all for profiteering says his sister-in-law, Vediha, to Mevlut later, as his innocence beguiles his understanding of the truth and what is actually happening around him. He seems to be mocked for this and therefore taken advantage of. His strength of character is actually in his endearing nature, handsome boyish looks and in his weakness to often succumb.. He eventually comes of age as does Istanbul in parallel; it’s his journey to this realisation amidst tangible changes in society and in those he loves and befriends, that is the essence of this journey. But this book also details the changes in Istanbul as well as a man who is, in fact, the heart of what istanbul was and still can be….he spends the four decades which the plot covers, to slowly come to an understanding of intent…of the heart and of words… of why he has felt this continued and forlorn emptiness and worthlessness.. It’s how he, one boy from a poor village comes to live in Istanbul at age 12 with his father and learns the trade of late night street vending with that heavy beam across his shoulders, 30kg on each end, symbolically also carrying the weight of Istanbul too and the changes that occur. It’s the weight of the past and the future and our protagonist is trying to balance both.. Mevlut learns more from his father than just selling…he becomes a man of commitment and discipline, one of justice, respect, honesty, care and love. He eventually rises above them all….his extended family and friends. And survives independently, breaking ties at last. Boza and Mevlut enter your own heart and stay there.. Pamuk has successfully created a sense of place in his epic 600 page novel with 7 Parts. A few Contents pages and a Family Tree introduced us to the setting, characters and scenes to come; it was equally beneficial if you take the time to go through it carefully. It was also useful to reference throughout if you become confused and it helped to clarify many aspects of this detailed plot.. With beautiful and alluring quotations from great authors and poets like Wordsworth, preceding most chapters, and with an added post-story Index of Characters and Chronology of Events which further aided in the reader's understanding and knowledge, much like a historical document does, helped to define and clarify the plot and time-line more accurately. Well done to the author as, collaboratively, they proved to be excellent functional writing features.. There were 2 pictorial images (a Boza street vendor and a painting of the cemetery with cypress trees where Mevlut often found himself for moments of solitude, akin to his past village life), near the end which further enhanced the reader’s involvement. This book has been intensely researched and no doubt, accurately portrayed historically, politically, socially etc. The translation by Ekin Oklap was outstanding…it was almost flawless. The flow-on affect culminates in a document worthy of Turkish archives.. I found that by devoting long, solid blocks of time over a few days, I was able to keep up with the pace and plot. Otherwise I’d have forgotten and would need to re-read; time is an issue in such lengthy saga’s. But the font size was too small! And not only that but my copy was quite feint which, along with the crammed intensity of a veritable tabloid of text upon text, small and overcrowded, it was as though I too were experiencing the crammed and noisy Turkish markets and environmental hazards, high-rises and dark alleys. Perhaps it added to the atmosphere.. I’m sure it was not intended and I’m also sure that many readers would give up on this book as a few Bookclub friends did, which is a pity. The length put many a reader off. It could have been reduced quite a bit, cutting many a long-winded tale down, or thrown out completely. I’d say that 450-500 pages would be ideal or a larger font at least to snare the avid reader. Our eyes are too strained after this mammoth read…for all of the above re the print, my grading of this book was lowered a tad.*. Indeed the positives outweigh the negatives. The characters in the tale were fleshed out very well through their alternating voices of narration and perspectives, often interrupting and portraying their own musings on a matter. One felt closer to each character, understood who they were and what they were experiencing. Each personal story put the reader into their mind. It was absolutely clever, maintained a discussion style so that the reader felt part of it, as if they were talking to him/her. Often the characters addressed the reader as ‘you’ etc to include us in the conversation. That Pamuk used the characters to speak both personally and directly to the reader was an engaging writing style at its best.. The writing also gave a visual and tangible feel to the city…its mosques and prayers, the Holy Guide, shops, street-sellers, the population, narrow roads, dense traffic, and general topography of a pre-and post-expansion of Istanbul by the Bosphorus, over the decades. That the next generation was more in tune with the West, especially given the impact of television in each home, was reflected clearly. The East-West imagery, detail and ideology etc cannot be missed as Pamuk grinds it against the traditions of a Turkish culture changing rapidly before his own eyes and through Mevlut’s.. A Strangeness in my Mind is an intense research of Turkey, notably Istanbul, its politics, some history including the Ottoman Empire, Sultans, mosques, tribes, village life in the country, cultural and religious practises, compulsory military training, the friction and life of a soldier on the field, with its many and varied Turkish customs and traditions both vast and intriguing, different and perplexing. However, it is the growth of a huge city (from 3 million to 13 million over 40 years) that captures the reader across almost 600 pages.. A city of tradition confronting the ways of the West seeping in. This grand city tale also creates a poignant and fascinating story reflected through the life of our poor, village-born protagonist, the Boza seller. When he sells his boza, as well as trying to sell ice-cream, yoghurt, chicken and rice etc over the decades, it is a story of wilful survival, in keeping his head above water and keeping a tradition alive from the past…he hangs onto his pride in every way. And for that we can only admire him.. Indeed, against the backdrop of dark lanes, old, small Greek structures (re the Cyprus war when Greeks moved in but who were then forced out of Turkey thus abandoning their homes), and the casual and rather slow-paced lifestyle of smoking, having long conversations and meetings in coffee-houses, drinking raki, living amidst unsavoury criminals, warring feuds, the Left and Right activists, Mevlut’s fear of dogs always looming, his peace within cypress tree-lined cemeteries, the Holy Guide at the end and his Righteous Path, then a late 20th century hi-rise growth (the Hadji Famut Vural Tower of power for one), extending Istanbul’s city limits further and further, razing slums and with it, a history of the old ways and customs…and Istanbul’s very heart…iconically captured in Mevlut…to become swallowed up by a cement jungle of multi-story apartments and malls of which Mevlut and his family eventually accept…is the physical scaffolding to this drama.. The essence of its spirit though is the family saga and a wonderful love story. A displacement of sorts too. Feuds and secrets within. Where village males moved to Istanbul for work, mostly as street vendors. When Mevlut joined his father in this village tradition, away from his mother and sisters, who were rarely seen or heard of thereafter, it is he who becomes the central character to Pamuk’s plot.. The saga is all wrapped up in the exclusive love story of Mevlut and Rayiha. In the opening pages, he professes his undying love for her in many a romantically written letter over 3 years, after only engaging her eyes within her covered head scarf, at a family wedding. We realise soon after that he has been duped by a cousin, Suleyman, into believing it was Rayiha when in fact it was her sister, Samiha, who he really loved.. Thus the wretched cousin also assists in Mevlut’s elopement with the ‘wrong’ sister. Does Mevlut fall in love with this sister? In the end, yes. The plot of Mevlut’s love is set against, and is in parallel, to the corruption within the city and by his own cousins in fact.. The other cousin Korkhut, Sulyman’s brother, marries the elder sister Vediha who becomes something of a mediator between the main characters. But where does Korkhut go all the time? He is rude and dogmatic, keeping his wife within the confines of her home…but she manages to leave to help her sisters at times.. Their two boys are the same as their father. Male dominance irks you but later in the book, Vediha spends a few pages unleashing her thoughts and feelings in a continual prose of questions. She expresses not only her life but that of many women in Turkey.. Both Suleyman and Korkhut taunt and mock Mevlut and even his two daughters, Fahra and Fevziye, who are educated; they eventually leave Istanbul and marry. There is a feeling of strength and independence within this new generation. And that their beautiful-eyed aunt, Samiha, helps them after their mother’s terrible death, tells the reader more about this woman too. She is an advocate of the new woman…whereas Rayiha, who Mevlut had married first, represented the traditional woman of Turkey, always cooking and organising the family home. But she was Mevlut’s support and strength, and love.. Mevlut, metaphorically, is forced into accepting the new Turkey when the old one died, razed from the ground. But it’s not until the last page when he realises that it was, even after marrying Samiha finally (after her own husband Ferhat is murdered; was it the cousin?), that it was Rayiha, from his first marriage, who was his real love…the traditional Turkey. The strangeness in his mind is resolved. It is an engrossing book!. Samiha, as it turns out, is both a likeable and unlikeable character despite her intoxicating and beautiful eyes which became the focus of Mevlut’s love letters. It may indicate that eyes aren’t necessarily reflecting the character within. Her bossy manner and modern attitude was too much for poor Mevlut but he’d made his bed in choosing to marry her after his first wife died. Likewise he had to embrace the modernism shaking Istanbul up even if he didn’t like it after it had begun.. But Rayiha’s early death is sad and tragic; the old village method of aborting caused her to bleed to death. It’s symbolic of the end of an era, the village ways, the old life. Ironically, Samiha never conceived or had children with Fevlut but this was not explained. Her choice perhaps as she is the modern and independent woman.. Her influence of the modern ways upon Mevlut and her sister’s daughters, creates the image of a new Turkish woman teaching the new western ways in the young, preparing them for a different future to that of their mother’s. They will not, no doubt, accept the male dominance and treatment of women either, which their other aunt, Vediha, experienced; this was a realistic depiction indeed.. I didn’t like the corruption and criminal intent and especially the lack of humane values in many characters. The idea of an ‘honour’ killing was mentioned or alluded to but was Fevlut killed in this manner? Deeply ingrained values and customs such as this is both frightening and no doubt, still happening. That a killing of this nature is imminent is a horrifying way to live. Disturbing.. These Turkish ways are extreme traditional methods from days-gone-by in different regions or tribes where villagers took control of family matters. We still hear of it today. The lifestyle and customs became too intense at times, confusing etc especially re racial beliefs, political tensions, activism etc.. It’s a lot to take in amidst the other detail along the way. I think I learned more about tribes, especially the Kurds, currently relevant in our global tensions, the racial squabbles within each group and the constant threats everywhere. Nobody felt safe it seemed.. I did not feel safe in Istanbul when visiting there with my partner several years ago; we were stalked by several men at ATM’s, followed and watched in the hotel by a family of eerie brothers! I love the culture and the atmosphere but the intensity of people and traffic, shop sellers etc was overwhelming to a coastal Aussie dweller.. It is a beautiful artistic, spiritual place in the mosques and walking along the river away from the hustle and bustle was more reflective when looking back at the city’s skyline…I understand why Mevlut found solace in the cemeteries! A very different society to my own but a fascinating history which I enjoyed through the eyes of Mevlut and other narrators Pamuk created. Yet it somehow balanced the plot and further highlighted the good characters such as Mevlut and his own father.. But Turkey, like Mevlut’s mind, has its strangeness as the title insists. Throughout the plot the feeling of something not quite right, lingered in Mevlut’s mind..that strangeness…begun when he realised that he had married the wrong sister…and that dogs were chasing him…black dogs of depression one assumes….a fear of loneliness and emptiness. And at the end, he tells us that he had felt inadequate all of his life. How terribly sad.. But did Istanbul too feel inadequate in the global world? His Holy Guide, a spiritual master, gave him insight. That a religious leader lifted his spirits and who Mevlut sought assistance from several times, explains the depth of not only Mevlut’s growing faith or connection but Turkey’s traditions and past still being sought by the young scholars who came to converse with the Holy Guide, seeking his enlightenment.. On the last page, the answer came to Mevlut readily and without fear. His public and private view was that “I love selling Boza”!. Boo-zaa.....Boo-zaa. That Turkish song in the streets is who Istanbul was and still is…it must retain its roots, its identity, Pamuk is saying.. And Mevlut’s heart had intended as much as what his words always meant to say…. ""I have loved Rayiha more than anything in the world”.. He loved the woman he first married after all!. Such an engaging and intriguing book, powerful and poignant. I thoroughly enjoyed the capacity to learn and love another culture, a man and his boza. Forever faithful, honest and endearing Mevlut.. I want to know more about him, his family and city, in this wonderfully written coming-of-age saga.. * lowered to 4.5","Dec 10, 2018"
964406,Nick,"Well that was a disappointment. I have read a few of Pamuk's novels and was looking forward to his latest, based slightly on his Nobel prize winning acceptance speech. I believe I have just read the wrong author or the wrong book. This read more like a daytime soap opera - without the melodrama - than a Nobel laureate's defining work. There is a curious plot twist - & I'm not giving the story away by telling you the central character Mevlut marries the wrong woman because we find that out in the first chapter - and there are some difficult family relationships, but nothing really gripping.. There are in fact two main characters in this book: Mevlut who holds a series of jobs alongside his vocation as a nightly street vendor of a traditional drink called Boza, and Istanbul, its recent history, its streets, its characters and its feel. Neither of these characters was compelling enough to engage much interest. Mevlut is a lovely guy, somewhat naive and easily manipulated as he has no wish to upset anyone. This makes for the sort of person you want as a friend as you know s/he will always have your back, but it also makes for an unproactive protagonist. Mevlut doesn't live his life; life happens to Mevlut. As he tries to navigate between his best friend's left-wing activism and his cousins' religious fanaticism, leading up to the last military coup, Mevlut is unable or unwilling to take sides as he is duped into helping both. Istanbul is portrayed in all its sprawling, haphazard corruption. I know both of these characters well. I have met them and shared some years with them. But reading them in this book did not inspire me or increase my love for them.. A Strangeness in my Mind is a really long read. There are a lot of pages to get through, but as not much really happens it seems to take ages. Occasionally Mevlut considers the Strangeness in his mind, but not regularly enough for it to become a theme and ultimately inconclusively.","Jan 26, 2018"

67635299,Begum Donmez,"The story of the book is about a man called Mevlut who came from Anatolia to Istanbul to make a living with his father. The book involves 43 years of his life starting from his childhood to his elderly ages containing his multiple jobs and marriages. He believes that there is something different about himself and his mind and goes through a request to find his answers. The book also reflects the political and social situations Turkey has been through in the last 50 years, which makes it a great guide for someone who wants to learn about close history of Turkey. Even though in his previous books Pamuk dealt with contemporary politics of Turkey, in this book he chose a different path and rather than dealing with bourgeoisie, he portrays the sociologic chances among the lower class people and their daily struggles. Those of you who read the Museum of Innocence before may have difficulty adopting this novel due to its different topic but if you liked his style in that book you might also enjoy this one.. Personally I am not one of the biggest fans of Pamuk. Not because his political views or else but because his writing style. It is a well-known fact that he is a successful writer with a Nobel Prize and he is also one of the most important voices that shapes contemporary Turkish literature. But I always have this dilemma in my mind; to be accepted by his society and to give the feeling of familiar sense in his books, one need to write in valid dialect and perception which enables him to be successful globally, and when he writes about the Turkish culture in a global sense then he misses the connection with native readers. As a globally successful writer I believe that this is what he is missing. The thing that I am referring as ‘perception’ is not something that can be perceived by foreign readers in a translation text of course, but as a native speaker I always feel like something is missing while reading his book as if I have a visitor, a distant relative, whom I know yet I am not sharing anything in common. Of course this situation has a lot to do with the fact that as a well-educated upper-class man, Pamuk himself is not similar with the typical Turkish people. So if I were to be a foreign reader I would love to read his works to learn about the things that I don’t know about Turkey but as a native there was nothing new or exciting that caught my attention including the language itself.","May 16, 2017"
4903061,Veronika,"Going through my 2nd Orhan Pamuk book, it once again had the effect of pulling you into a completely different world & making you feel as if you've known the characters for years. The way its written is absolutely effortless & the transitions of seeing the story from different people's perspectives gave it even more depth.. For those interested in politics & historical events in Turkey & specifically the ones having directly affected Istanbul, you'll absolutely love this book! (for me there were other factors that made it enjoyable 🙈). The story starts with the captivating moment of a man having written 3 years worth of love letters intended for a girl he only briefly saw at a wedding & their journey of running away together.. The worst thing that could've gone wrong actually happens - it's not the right girl the main character ends up running away with, but her sister, with him not having the chance to turn back. The only down part is that the plot gets cut off at this point in time & goes back to the entire life story of the Mevlut, the main character, starting from his earliest childhood days. That part does drag itself on, when you simply want to know what happened after the great escape, but about 200 pages in (out of about 750), the pace picks up again.. All in all, the book is an incredibly detailed insight into Turkish culture presented over so many years up until the current time.. It's a fascinating tale introducing you to daily life rituals, traditions, mentalities of people & their beliefs. It touches so many points of different relationships among people - between parents & children, between siblings, friends & married couples.. All that described in such an authentic way, it almost seems as tangible as a story about people you know in your own life.. A definite recommendation from my side (with 1 reduction of a star for the bumpy beginning which takes quite a while to get into).","Aug 01, 2017"
27482323,Omar Taufik,"Our great author Orhan Pamuk spent six years writing this novel .. the result was this masterpiece ... In his previous works, the author tells his stories from the eyes of the modernized Istanbul upper class in which he belongs to , this time the story was told from the other side .. from the eyes of the poor street vendor class in Istanbul ... It is the story of Mevlut the street vendor .. life and Istanbul in his eyes and mind, the story of the Anatolian immigrants leaving their traditional lives of the village to settle down in modern cosmopolitan Istanbul , it is the story of the capital of the world Istanbul with it's changes from the late 1960s to the year 2012 .. the author actually chronicles the transformation of the city using the stories of the Anatolian villagers and their huge migration to Istanbul in millions during the second half of the twentieth century... He uses a wide range of characters from various Anatolian hometowns of diverse ethnic, religious, political backgrounds .. and with great talent has a story for each character with their own view and perspective of life different from the other characters... As in his previous works, we have the subjects of East vs West , tradition vs modernity, religious vs secular .. stories of love, ethnic and political violence, gender and generation struggles ... and the great question of happiness between intentions and fate ... This novel will get the immersed reader into a process of meditations on life meanings through the special world existing within the mind of the main character Mevlut Karataş and his thoughts as he would call it A Strangeness in my Mind ... which was one of the main factors of making this book special to myself deserving a straight 5 rating and a high recommendation for lovers of Istanbul and readers looking for the depth and beauty of life ..","Aug 14, 2017"
11407801,Dramatika,"An excellent meditative study on the history of the city and the poor migrants from the villages. Some of them managed to ride the social elevator higher, some barely survived. Poor honest boza seller, afraid of dogs, government authorities and even women, Mevlut is timid yet passionate. His passsion for the woman, whose eyes he saw during the wedding in the village, prompted him to follow the urging of his friend and elope. He is passionate about his trade, stubbornly continuing ancient tradition already dying out in the city. When I visited the city recently, only the sellers of sesame bagel like things are there. And chestnut sellers, filling the air with wonderful aroma. The story is told through the various points of view of different narrators. So, it reminds the readers that everything is not what it seems, since everyone has their own vision of the events. And there is another story whjch is told along the one of Mevlut. The story of Istanbul in the last part of the previous century and the beginning of this one. The book helped me to understand the events that are troubling Turkey now. The recent coup is just one of the many political upheavals that have been happening in the recent past. The strong forces of conservatives and liberals, sects and ethnic clashes are just part of Istanbul rich and painful history. The city is 14 mln last time I visited, again full of newcomers from the villages as well as refugees from conflict zones. It all repeats once again on a new spin.. One of the best books I've read this year. Orhan Pamuk, you did it again! Bravo!","Nov 14, 2016"
1026058,Michelle,"Reading this book is like sitting for a cup of tea with an old friend - there are trivial parts and serious parts and funny parts and sad parts. The narration, which mostly followed Mevlut but was often intercepted by first-person narration from his various friends and family, felt like a typical gathering amongst loved ones. ""We"" talked about the politics influencing Turkey, immigration, violence, religion, and economics. Just as friends do when they get together to drink tea. ""We"" shared in trivial chatting about characters and opinions - arguments about what people said and did, about what they should do. Just as family members will bicker with one another. Orhan Pamuk did an excellent job of drawing the reader into the simple world of a poor, simple, and marvelous here.. It is a book about humanity; about a man and a woman but really, about a man and his city. As I read Mevlut's journey, selling boza and yogurt on the streets of Istanbul, I could relate to his evolving feelings towards the city. I know those feelings - of belonging and not, of being familiar and unfamiliar; of loving and disdaining. The central debate - which is more important, intentions or actions? - plays out in the drama between Mevlut and his cousins; the drama he experiences when he tries to court a woman he falls for at first sight; the drama he experiences in his work. Family relations, friends, business and lovers are all put to the test. It is an immensely satisfying book to experience, and I look forward to reading other novels by this author.","Jun 20, 2017"
1112140,Sandy,"""I'll never read THAT!"", I rudely exclaimed to my friend who handed me the 734 page novel because she thought I would like, no love, this Turkish author. To compensate for feeling like a complete ass, I begrudgingly agreed to attempt a few chapters. Quickly, I fell in love with Melvut, the bozo seller and his family and friends.. The story begins with Malvut eloping in the darkness with a woman he has been writing love letters to for 3 years. He had seen her once at a cousin's wedding, but was enamored with her and drawn to her dark eyes. He knew her only as Rayhiya. When darkness turns to dawn, Malvut sees that the woman is actually her older sister. He must have felt a little like Jacob after he lifts the veil of ""Rachel"" and discovers Leah instead. What to do. Whoops! Wrong sister? Or proceed as Jacob did and begin a life with the other sister.. A Strangeness in My Mind. spans 40 years, showcasing the evolution of the characters and of Turkey. The characters are poor, richly developed, conflicted and often humorous. They are Muslims who dance between the not quite secular and the not quite religious. One may simplistically view the women in the novel as submissive and controlled by patriarchy, (particularly Westerners), but underneath the headscarves reveal feisty, head strong, smart and determined women.. A Strangeness in My Mind. was a wonderful, albeit long, surprise. I recommend it only to my friends who have the patience to read and savor 734 pages.","Apr 10, 2019"
17915669,Marilyn Saul,"I vacillate between two and three stars. For me, this was a tough book. I was more than 1/2 way through when I realized that I'd lost interest in the characters that I had bonded with in the first 1/2. The book had become tedious: I tired of Mevlut's obdurate attitude towards the changes that made his chosen profession obsolete, thus relegating him and his family to extreme poverty and, basically, perpetuating the failures of his father. Add to that Rayiha's growing obsessions and the interspersed emphasis on male ""honor"" (e.g. pride) and the inability of most of the characters to adapt to twentieth century changes, and I just had to give up. I admit that I skimmed the last 75 pages. Lest I be faulted for not understanding how difficult adapting to the changes of the last half of the century are in an Islamic country, I lived in such a country in the 80s, including living in a ""primitive"" village with no running water and only gathered wood for cooking/cleaning. Despite the hardships, many members of the family with whom I lived went on to advanced college degrees, including many of the women. Realistically, I think this book, IMO, attempted to hold the whole culture responsible for not transitioning, when, in actuality, it was dysfunctional individual human flaws perpetuated over generations that comprised the ""strangeness"". I was very disappointed and quite glad to be done with it.","Oct 14, 2019"
59775414,Sally Edsall,"I really wanted to love this. And did. In parts.. It took a long to read; it is 584 trade size pages (plud i dex to characters and a timeline - more on that later) and HEAVY. I actually had trouble holding it at times.. So, Pamuk is one of my favourite authors, especially when he is wroting about his home city, Istanbul.. This book covers the period 1968, when our 11 year old hero, Mevlut, moves from his Anatolian village to Istanbul, to 2012.. Mevlut is a kind of Everyman, and his coming of age and maturity parallels the profoind changes in the city.. It's a family saga - father, cousins, people from back in the village, wives, children, friends. The characters and relationships are all drawn really well.. What I found however is that it lacks uncertainty, discovery, tension. Mainly because so much is telegraphed from the outset. I also made the mistake of reading the timeline, which interweaves historical moments and changes with the events of the fictional characters (it's actually given me food for thought about some structural issues with the fiction I am writing).. I would love to give it 5 stars, but that lack of anticipation being replaced with ""I wonder when this is going to happen"" brought it back a bit.. Still, for a jolly good story, and a great portrait of a great city over 45 years, it's fantastic.","May 05, 2017"
14399908,Davidg,"This is my second attempt at reading Pamuk. I did try 'My Name is Red' when it first came out in the U.K. but I gave up after a couple of hundred pages. I really didn't care who had done it and it was going to take wading through several hundred more to find out. So, although the premise and first few pages, read in Waterstones, appealed, I wasn't sure that I would get through the 700 plus pages of this.. I thought it was a beautiful book. No doubt I didn't pick up all the references, not knowing recent Turkish history and the development of Istanbul as well as many native readers. But it was easy to recognise the expansion of the city and the success of those greedy and manipulative enough; just look at cities in the U.K.. Melvut is perhaps too much of an innocent, seeing the good in Kurds, communists, islamists, the secular and the capitalists, without ever corrupting himself. Instead he has family, sort of, and love, if not in the way he originally expected.. All the way through you wanted this Everyman to survive, even if he would never succeed in worldly terms. Although you knew that disasters awaited, the family tree at the beginning and the end of the prologue tells you (not to mention some chapter titles in the contents), you want his spirit and hope to remain..

2423729,Jenn,"A Strangeness in My Mind. is fabulous. It's watching the progression of life through a sliver of the blinds. Orhan Pamuk writes about the great changes that took place in Istanbul, Turkey from 1982 to 2012 using the life and times of a boza seller named Mevlut.. Mevlut and his father move from their small village to Istanbul where his father hopes to make a better living off of selling yogurt and boza as street venders. Mevlut, not much for school, ends up leaving school, completing his military service and following in his father's footsteps.. Over his thirty years, he marries, falls in love, has two daughters, becomes widowed, becomes a grandfather, remarries, watches friends die or move away and all the while, continues to sell boza. Selling boza ties Mevlut to the city. He walks the streets at night, watching buildings rise and fall and even bigger buildings rise in their place.. Orhan Pamuk is brilliant. His characters are flawed and beautiful, frustrating and hilarious. Mevlut, especially, can be all of those things. As Suleyman implies at the end of the novel - life would not be the same for any of them without Mevlut. Though he is quiet, unassuming and avoids conflict, he has a deep impact on everyone in his life.. This is a great book for anyone who wants to understand Turkish culture at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st.","Aug 27, 2017"
4548437,Juliane,"While reading this book I was wondering if I actually read the same book that everyone is raving about. I just could not become interested in the characters, and there was absolutely no story. I felt like Pamuk tried to hook people by hinting on the fact that Mevlut ended up marrying the wrong woman, which kind of makes you want to find out why that happened. That was the only reason why I kept on reading. I didn't enjoy the writing, it was not deep enough somehow,and the vocabulary he used was very average, neither interesting nor beautiful. I normally love books that jump back and forth in time, but in this case it didn't add anything to the understanding of the story and was not structured in a meaningful and logical manner. The only reason I see in the time jumps is to create curiosity, suspense and interest, which is kind of sad because the story itself is not enough and it needs those tricks to make it interesting. The story can be summarised in 2 sentences, and as soon as you know what happens it's not worth to keep on reading because the language and the writing itself is not good enough. Good books should be enjoyable, even if you know what happens. I felt like I wasted my time and money...","Nov 13, 2015"

It's still a good book, but I was just expecting something great from Orhan. It follows the life of an Istanbul street vendor who goes around the streets of Istanbul selling a drink popularized in the Ottoman era, but gradually losing its appeal in the modern times.. We follow this street vendor's life as he moves from a small village to Istanbul when he is a young boy. As he grows up to become a street vendor, Istanbul is changing all around him, more migrants coming in and trying to build their lives. As usual, Orhan has thoroughly researched everything, we get to read about what Istanbul went through in the last 50 years or so, how the city evolves to become what it is. That's what I really like about Orhan's books, they are very well researched. Reading this I got to learn about the recent history of Istanbul.. The only thing is that this book is just a little monotonous. You are left wanting something more. Things happen in this book, but overall it just feels a little dull.. Nest up on my list is his novel Snow. Heard really good things about it, hopefully that one lives up to expectations.","Sep 17, 2018"

785013,ingrid,"First let me say that 5* meaning ""it was amazing"" is too high a standard for almost any book, IMO. Perhaps if I could I'd give this book a 4.5 based on Goodread's definitions.. The book is written in a clear, easy to follow way, and moves steadily so that I can't imagine anyone getting bored or wondering when some sections will end. The protagonist, Mervlut, is kind of a naif, who we follow through his life, as we root for him and we want him to obtain what it seems he deserves. He is a boza seller, which is well explained early in the book, boza being a popular fermented beverage in Turkey and other countries. He finds deep satisfaction in a trade which is becoming little by little obsolete, as it allows him to wander the streets of Istanbul and to engage with all sorts of people. The main plot has to do with his falling in love in his early 20's with a young woman he glimpses at a family wedding, to whom he writes love letters for three years, only to have an unforeseen turn of events interfere and change his life. Mervlut is a charming and captivating protagonist. This book was voted one of the 10 best of the year in the Wall Street Journal.","Dec 20, 2015"
22615200,Andrew F,"Have been and will be digesting this book for a while. The characters were so believable that sometimes I forgot I was reading a work of fiction. But at times, it felt so realistic as to be unremarkable. I was invested at points, but not like some books. There are a few bombshells and dynamic episodes, but more often it's long strings of plain, mundane life stuff that we all relate to. Whether or not that's ultimately the charm of the book remains an open question for me.. Did not like the format at first - where everyone's story is told through first-person snippets (like a documentary-style reality show, e.g. The Office) - but after a while it felt right for the broad scope of the story, which is of the whole life of an Istanbul street vendor and his family/friends. Mixed in is a lot of rich detail on the history of Istanbul's politics, urban development, and shifting cultural/religious/social zeitgeists that alone make the book worth reading if you're curious about Turkey in the second half of the 20th century. Having spent some time there a couple years ago, I think I got more out of this book than I otherwise might have; it's why I decided to read it after all.","May 07, 2017"
8717163,Eleanor,"Fine storytelling. In this book, you see Istanbul's society over 60 years change and change again, through the eyes of a protagonist who fundamentally does not change. Several times the narrative mentions how Mevlut observes ongoing events or relives the past in his mind as if he were 'outside' himself; these struck me as allusions to Mevlut's role as a looking-glass, of sorts, on the city. The philosophical musings and ethical questions that occur to him when he lets his mind roam free in the evenings mirror and reflect the ambiguities of purpose and morality around him in family life, economic life, politics, and religion, during a period of rapid expansion and gentrification.. At the same time, Mevlut's experiences address many universally human themes: imagination and fantasy, fear of loneliness and ultimate insignificance, the contrast between public views and private views, the distance between intentions and actions, the tension between what is said and what is meant, lying and truth and honesty, pride, forgiveness, trust in others and trust in God, fate, and the value of tradition.","Jun 16, 2017"
27046143,S M Shahrukh,"A huge venture from Turkey's premier novelist - almost six hundred pages, a family tree at the beginning, a chronology of events at the end. A novel of many many characters with Mevlut, the boza-seller, who comes from rural Anatolia to Istanbul in the late sixties telling the story of the changing landscape of a city, in a way subliminally, often directly, describing the change coming over his country.. A postmodernist novel where Pamuk's eternal confusion of identity with Eastern and Western values comes to the forefront. The narrative is mostly quite well written but still, quite so often, seems a bit tiresome. A Turkey of secularist governments and military coups gradually goes into a reign of Islamists as Mevlut walks the streets selling boza and 'talking to himself'. And we have two closely related families that evolve from their rural roots to urban rapacity with many intrigues but Mevlut keeps dwindling between two worlds - the old and the new. The author used allegories that did not often seem to work. Maybe, Pamuk wanted to write something like Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks, a long saga of a family, but he has failed to reach the heights of Mann.","Jul 22, 2017"
743954,Nicole G.,"Several years ago, I read ""Snow,"" and while overall was not enamored of Pamuk's writing, deigned to give him another chance. So, when someone suggested him again for book club, I felt the time was right to try once more.. This meandering family saga set in Istanbul follows the story of Mevlut, a boza seller who just wants a good life. After glimpsing a girl's eyes at a wedding before he goes off to compulsory military service, Mevlut composes three years of letters to this girl and makes plans to elope with her, as her father will not give consent to marry to just anyone. When he finally accomplishes it with the help of friends, he realizes that this is the wrong sister. But he is determined to make the best of it.. This is not really a spoiler, as the story begins here and then goes back in time to tell us of Mevlut's life, and here is where Pamuk gives us an interesting conceit - Mevlut's life is told in third-person, but there are also friends and family telling their parts of the story in their own words. I really enjoyed this aspect of the book.. If you like dramatic family stories, you might want to pick this one up.","Oct 26, 2017"
27386734,Daniel,"This is what I wanted from Orhan. A story that is all about an average Turk from an average Anatolian village, trying to make it as one of 10 million migrants in the suburbs of Istanbul.. You will love Mevlut and Rayiha, and the story of his life is a great one.. In terms of style, this novel has almost no abstraction, which is a surprise if you've read anything from Orhan before. Also, there is no cameo from a character named Orhan living in Nişantaşı, although there is a sneaky mention of the 'Heart of the City'- also the name of the Pamuk family's apartment building, and you can't help thinking that some of the unnamed nostalgic boza customers in Çukurcuma might be Orhan himself. Or perhaps it's obvious that in Mevlut's nighttime roaming around the city is also a part of Orhan.. Overall it adds another angle to Orhan's bookshelf of stories that describe Istanbul, its 'hüzün' melancholy, the way people absorb the city as another part of their character, and the way the city absorbs its people.","Apr 21, 2015"

Onunla hemhal olup İstanbul sokaklarında dolaşmak, 70'lerden bugüne olan dönüşümünü gözlemlemek inanılmaz bir duyguydu. Mevlut'un ikilemlerini, duygularını iliklerime kadar hissettim. 466 sayfa nasıl hızla geçti anlamadım. En hızlı okuduğum kitaplardan biriydi. Orhan Pamuk'un kavrayışına, zekasına bir kez daha hayran oldum. Mutlaka okuyun.. I really love the mind of Orhan Pamuk. This situation intensifies with the every new book of him that I read. This book is special for me because its center point is İstanbul. Mevlut (the main character) strolls around the city mostly at night and observes the changing urban landscape. I amazed by looking at the city with the eye of Mevlut who is migrated from the small village of Anatolia. Everyone especially who lives and loves İstanbul should definitely read this novel.

24624844,Kumar,"Tale of a street boza seller in Istanbul. The city is teeming with life as he is aging. The book explores loneliness, death, intentions, and fate.. Favorite passages:. ""When he shouted 'Boo-zaa', he could feel the paintings in his mind emerging from his mouth like speech bubbles in a cosmic book before dissolving into the weary streets like clouds...He sensed, now, that the streets on which he sold boza in the night and the universe in his mind were one and the same."". ""Intentions come in two forms...that which our heart intends and that which our words intend...what our words intend will reflect what our heart intends...Kismet was the force that bridged the gap between what our heart intended and what our words intended."". ""Now he knew what it was that he wanted to tell Istanbul and write on its walls. It was both his public and his private view; it was what his heart intended as much as his words had always meant to say. He said it to himself - 'I have loved Rayiha more than anything in this world'.","Jun 26, 2017"
9113276,Patricia,"Classic Pamuk, rich with the history of Turkey and the role of the boza seller, a street vendor, who peddles the fermented and slightly alcoholic drink while roaming the neighborhood streets. This is a story of love, betrayal, and simple people grappling with societal and economic progress. I loved the tale of the protagonist, Mevlut Karatas, walking the neighborhoods selling yogurt and boza to residents, their lowering a container from their flat to street level to be filled or inviting Mevlut inside. Mevlut is betrayed by Ferhat and Suleyman when he thought he was writing love letters to the girl of his dreams. Abdurrhman Efendi was three daughters Vediha, Rayiha, and the most beautiful Samiha.. My criticism of the book is that it was too long weighing in at 586 pages. While the story was endearing there was not enough plot to justify 586 pages causing the themes to be repetitive. The story was powerful but it would have been even more so at 400 pages.","Jul 18, 2015"
17783742,Covey Mcallister,"This book has renewed my desire to explore Istanbul and Turkish culture. However, Pamuk does more than paint a perfect portrait of Turkey, he creates characters that are real, complex, dear to the reader. The hero feels refreshingly like a hero (reminiscent of Tolstoy's heroes) and more than once I was left in tears, more than once I laughed out loud.. The book has renewed my desire to hand write letters. I am inspired to study calligraphy. I must take up a needlework I set aside years ago. I must reread Rumi. We must all stand by our convictions. Pamuk inspires again and again.. The book has brought a new glimpse of the impact of finding a home, watching your very familiar surroundings grow and develop and deteriorate and grow again. Never have I felt so inspired to call one city my home, but Pamuk has a way of calling to even the most restless.. Astonishingly well written, a story told from many perspectives, a joy to read, a true work of art.","Oct 09, 2015"
27977524,Jane Giardino,"I really did enjoy this book- I'm not sure why I'm giving it 3, not 4 stars. I listened to the audiobook read by John Lee - I love his readings. It was a fascinating portrait of Turkish society and culture evolving through the 20th century. I am the same age, plus ou moins, as the author, and I was humbled by my lack of knowledge. The writing is lovely, and I SO want to go to Turkey, drink Boooo-zaaaa and eat everything described. The depth and complexity of fraud and corruption described is breathtaking, hilarious, and appalling. I found the characters complex and plausible, yet maddening and At times incapable of learning from experience- in other words, human to the core. And the melancholy-- very, very heavy.. I tried ""Snow"" years ago, but gave up. I will look for other works by this author, just for the joy of his beautiful prose and obvious love of deeply flawed men and women.","Apr 10, 2016"
20040110,Charlotte Burns,"This is the story of Mevlut, who elopes with a girl he has dreamed about since a family wedding only to find himself eloping to Istanbul with her older sister. The story then moves to the present day where Mevlut and his wife, Rayiha, are living in Istanbul and Mevlut is making a living walking the streets selling boza before returning to Mevlut's youth and narrating chronologically.. We hear about the lives of Mevlut's family and friends from their own commentary, offering a deeper insight into the events of the novel and the characters set amongst the political and cultural backdrop of life in Istanbul at these times. Much is made, for example, of women's rights and choices in relation to their marriages and the expectations placed on men to provide for their wives.. The novel is a long one, but Pamuk writes in such a way that the reader wants to take their time in enjoying story.","Jan 20, 2017"
44504599,Jon Erebus,"I think this is Pamuk's best work in English translation since. Istanbul: Memories and the City. , possibly even. My Name is Red. . Chronicling the life of street vendor Mevlut Karatas and his extended family through decades of hard work as migrants in Istanbul, Pamuk achieves not only to tell a captivating, human story, but also to explore the material realities of migration, urbanisation, and modernity. But as we follow Mevlut's nightly walks around Istanbul selling the traditional boza liquor, there is also room to linger on his personal ruminations around the distance between the private and the public, and his fundamental sense of strangeness. As this motif mingles with his memories of the fading Istanbul of his childhood, quickly giving way to today's modern metropolis, Pamuk conjures up a vivid sense of deep and lingering melancholy - which is a very good thing! A wonderful novel.","Feb 03, 2017"
62138265,Jeanett Elmer,"After 300+ pages, I have just put this book down because I feel like I am reading just for the sake of reading. I thought that it would entertain me with a great story that would give me cultural and psychological insight. Unfortunately nothing in the story has caught my attention so far. I was intrigued by the premise about the changeling bride, but that part of the story has been on hold for over 250 pages and now I simply don't understand what the book is supposed to be about. Also the title doesn't really come in to play. Mevlut sometimes senses this ""Strangeness in his mind"" but it isn't explained further and I think he is actually one of the simplest, most one sided characters I have ever read about. It just doesn't make sense.. All in all I feel that if I just wanted to know more about this period of Turkish history and politics, I could spend my time more effectively reading an encyclopaedia....","May 07, 2017"
37481245,Valentyna Katsalap,"I read “My Name is Red” and “Istanbul” before, and while I liked both books, I couldn't say Orhan Pamuk was one of my favorite writer. It has changed after reading “Strangeness in My Mind”.. Main characters are simple people who have to come up with some activities to survive in Istanbul. Mevlut is the protagonist, he is a boza seller. His life is not easy as he tries to do different jobs, set up business, deal with competitors, unstable demand and corruption of public officials. Mevlut's views on life in Istanbul and its development are very philosophical, they are clearly a reflection of Pamuk's views and his melancholy.. In addition to describing the history of Turkey and Istanbul, the book describes well family life and traditions. and attempts to answer the eternal question of what love is. The book is instrumental to understanding lives of Turkish migrants from poor villages in Central Anatolia, their attitude to schooling and education, marriage, kids, and women.","Jul 07, 2017"
13064732,Reza,"In this absolutely beautiful novel, Orhan Pamuk narrates the life of a poor street vendor in Istanbul over a course of 40 years. Although on the surface the plot of the story might sound quite simple, there are so many deep inner layers to this story that they will leave their marks on your mind and heart perhaps permanently. Under the surface, Pamuk does a masterful psychoanalysis of the main character, Mevlut Karatash, in the context of his love-hate relationship with Istanbul. The intricate layers of psychology and sociology are so well woven within the fabric of the story that if not enough attention is paid, you would barely notice their existence. It is also fascinating how Pamuk managed to portray such a strong and realistic picture of the city of Istanbul in his novel, to the point that I consider the city as one of the main characters in the story; alive, untamed and ever changing. This might be a long novel, but your time would be very well spent reading it.","Jul 10, 2018"
733871,Amit,"[Excerpts from my review on my blog:. https://asuph.wordpress.com/2016/07/2.... ]. In terms of the narration, Pamuk resorts to a mix of third person narration, with the multi-narrator technique that he so well employed in his best book to date: My Name is Red. That technique, in its measured application, works very well for this one too, as it gives a glimpse into more lives, more point-of-views, and builds a context to assess Mevlut's struggles, and tiny triumphs. And Pamuk is in fine form here, with a countenance of a test match specialist batsman who is reassured that time is on his side. Which means, for many, it is too slow for their comfort. Not me. I like books that water the plant, and wait patiently, for the bloom to come. And if you have time too, then Pamuk is enormously rewarding. The hüzün and the grays not withstanding.. 4.5/5.","Jul 07, 2016"
1719314,Jacek,"I wasn't expecting Pamuk to go for social realism. It's Pamuk, though, which means occasional grand moments (and I never know when he's likely to come out with one, which keeps me reading open-mindedly); one near the end (the last page of Chapter 14 of Part V) managed to put tears in my eyes, which from this particular book I didn't anticipate.. Nearing the end of my eight-novel Pamuk project (and, likewise, approaching the end of the really fun class that pushed me to persevere through it), I can't say I'm very impressed with Pamuk's work. I like him and appreciate some of what he can do, but he ultimately never rose to the heights that the finest chapters in. The Black Book. , the relentlessly great first half of.

He is a street vendor of yogurt and boza ( a slightly alcoholic drink) which is becoming an antiquated job as he is doing it. That is the background of the story which illustrates the social changes in Turkey throughout the 60s, to present. Turkey is secular but it’s customs are rooted in ancient divisions between men and women. I fell in love with Mevlut, his family and their trials and tribulations. The plot is kind of creaky with mistaken identity but in the hands of Pamuk it is a masterpiece. It is a languorous read and I loved every minute of it.","Feb 24, 2016"

But I can honestly say I loved. A Strangeness in My Mind. , because in this novel, the literary artistry and the historical, cultural and political themes are subtly interwoven in a story of completely believable, sympathetic human beings.

Since I'm only 150 pages in, there is no way that I'm going to finish it before it is due. And I'm not sure I can pick it back up again later.. 2. I was sort of hesitant about this book from the beginning. I loved My Name is Red but hated Snow. A friend highly recommended it, so I gave it a shot. So far, this book is long and I don't really see where it is going. If I had it longer I might push through, but I suspect that when it return it, it will be the end.. 10/15/16. I finished it.

It's a love letter to a girl that someone reads and mistakes for herself; a love letter to a city that's inevitably changing. What impressed me most was how much of an easy read this was, compared to other tomes. Their lives are more intertwined and there seems to be an easy cadence, and as he muses on the strangeness of his mind, it reflects ours.

12834468,Giuseppe,"this book plays a number of tricks with the reader. It opens with a very important happening for the main character. After, it moves back to the early life of the main character. Thus the reader experiences half of the book with hindsight. An hindsight that the main character misses. It gave me a strange feeling, a strangeness in my mind.. When, in the middle of the story, the reader reaches the point of the opening episode, a new magic happens: the reader has no hindsight any more, but the strangeness remains. Now it's more due to the turns life takes, all the unpredictable turns that make this book special. And all in the special Pamuk style.","Mar 17, 2017"

As he grows up, Istanbul itself also grows up. Mevlut falls in love, does his military service, marries, and has a family all while eking out a living. Istanbul itself goes through changes; political upheavals, coups, Islamization, electricity, modernization. Neighborhoods change. Ramshackle sheds become apartment buildings.

I don't necessarily mind that, but I also took awhile to finish this because the lack of 'plot' made picking it up a little bit of a chore.

62292689,Jack Deighton,"This is the story of Mevlut Karataş who wanders the streets of Istanbul at night selling boza – a kind of fermented drink concocted so as Turks could believe they were not actually drinking alcohol even though they were - from the panniers hung from the pole across his shoulders. While the narrative is mainly carried by a third person account of Mevlut’s life and thoughts, the viewpoints of many of the individuals connected to Mevlut are interpolated into the text. All of these are written in the first person and introduced by that narrator’s name. Though all the details of Mevlut’s life from his arrival in Istanbul to help his father on his boza rounds, through his prolonged and ultimately unfruitful sojourn at the Atatürk Secondary School for Boys, his years conscripted in the army, the attempts to sell yoghurt, ice cream and cooked rice, the other ventures into employment, cashier in a café, car park guard, electricity inspector - residents of Istanbul seem to have been very creative in the ways they could steal electricity from the supply company - it is his love life which provides the book’s main thrust.. The first chapter depicts the defining incident in Mevlut’s life, and it is as magic realist as you could wish - only not magical at all. For three years Mevlut had been writing letters to Rayiha, a girl whose eyes he had stared into at the wedding of his cousin Korkut. Korkut’s brother Süleyman agrees to help Mevlut elope with Rayiha and arranges the deed. When Mevlut glimpses the girl in the back of Süleyman’s van that night he is bewildered to discover she is not the one he thought he had been writing to. Nevertheless, he marries her, comes to love her and have two daughters with her. Süleyman’s deception, of course, (he had designs on the girl with the eyes, Rayiha’s sister, Sadiha, himself,) has ramifications throughout the book.. Many observations about love are made within the text. Hadji Hamit Vural avows, “‘if you’re going to love a girl as deeply as your brother here ... you’ve got to make sure to start loving her after you’re married ...... but if you fall in love before that .. and you sit down to discuss the bride price with the girl’s father, then those cunning, crafty fathers will ask you for the moon ... Most couples would not fall in love if they got to know each other even just a little bit before getting married .... There is also the kind that happens when two people get married and fall in love after that ... and that can only happen when you marry someone you don’t know.’” Süleyman’s later lover Melahat (a stage performer under the name Mahinur Mehrem) lets us know that, “‘I could write a book about all the men I’ve known, and then I would also end up on trial for insulting Turkishness.’”. The changing face of the city into whose nooks and crannies Mevlut wanders plying his wares and the evolution of Turkish life become major themes, with the political ups and downs a background never fully occupying Mevlut’s mind; but a sense of the role played by emphasising the nation is never far away, “in this night, pure and everlasting, like an old fairy tale, being Turkish felt infinitely better than being poor.”. The more you read Pamuk the more it becomes clear that his real subject, his true love, is Istanbul; though Turkishness in the wider sense is also important and affairs of the heart never far away. Here Mevlut’s friend Ferhat tells us that, “What makes city life so meaningful is the things we hide.” Pamuk’s œuvre has probed into those hidden places - more so in. A Strangeness in my Mind. as his previous books have tended to concentrate more on middle class Istanbul, whereas here our hero (as Pamuk refers to Mevlut several times, this is a knowing type of narration) is one of those for whom getting on in the world has always been difficult, he does not know enough of the right people, never accumulates sufficient capital to become affluent.. Again in a Pamuk novel set in modern times there is an acute consciousness of football, but here no hint of anyone called Orhan Pamuk. If Istanbul itself were not enough, allusions to a journalist character from. The Black Book. would tie this novel in with previous works.. Through all his modern novels – and arguably in those set in historical times - Pamuk has been picking away at the threads of Turkish life, the tensions between religion and the secular sphere, the restrictions set on the people by political, societal and religious dictats. It is almost possible having read enough Pamuk to feel you know something about Turkey, and especially about Istanbul. This may be a delusion but it’s closer to the truth than those without that experience can ever have.","May 19, 2019"
39840784,Asena Dirican,"I finished Orhan Pamuk's novel ""A Strangeness in My Mind"" in 2 days. The book was just over 450 pages. Don't get confused and think I read it too fast. I did not skim even one word. Instead, I read it attentively with a pen in my hand. Almost every fifth page, I underlined a sentence, paragraph or even a full page that I was amazed to read.. I will try to explain what amazed me the most. I’ll use three groups: writing style, details of everyday life and connections to my past. I will try not to give away the story. However, the story itself was not my main motivation to turn pages. My main motivation was his subtle use of beautiful details to describe the daily lives of ordinary characters.. The sections that I loved the most were the ones where I found some connections to my parent’s and my past. Both the main character, Mevlut, and my father were the same age when they moved to Istanbul from their small villages. Their motivations were also quite similar: having a better education. Luckily my father was really smart like his village teacher proclaimed and his difficult years in Istanbul ended happily with a diploma from a prestigious university. Mevlut left high school in his second year.. Mevlut’s wife was younger than my mother but their journeys to Istanbul started the same year. Apparently, my parents were more educated than the main characters but their Istanbul experiences had many similarities. Then their two daughters were born. The older one was born in 1983 like me. The younger one was just 2 years older than my sister.. I feel so privileged that a big novelist like Orhan Pamuk spent his time to write about the ordinary lives of people who migrated to Istanbul from the east.. I also underlined so many details that trace back to the old days of Istanbul. Some of them I remembered while reading the novel, others were new to me because of my age. A few examples are the illegal use of electricity and parking place mafias. Another big change was that entertainment places changed from casinos to pavyons which showed the change from modern European style to one with more local touches.. I understand the poverty of old Istanbul better. The poor public expressed themselves by joining extreme right or left political groups. This was a way for them to forget about their poverty.. Of course, the section I loved reading the most was where this literary genius easily explained complicated emotions. Pamuk used contradictory emotions to explain character's instant reactions. For example, Mevlut was angry at his girls when they were making fun of him by repeating his sentence "" everything will be fine if you believe in good"". At the same time, he was also proud of them for standing up to him. They were tired of hearing the same suggestion every time they complained about their hard living conditions.. At the end of the book, there is a long chronological list of big events in Turkey, around the globe and in the characters' lives from 1950-2012. After reading that novel I no longer believe there is an individualized explanation of all our emotions, ways of thinking or values. However, most of them are explainable with the help of sociology.","May 31, 2019"
87554439,Mark Feder,"This novel tells the story of one man,Mevlut, his journey from adolescence to middle age, his family, and the physical, social and political changes that took place in Turkey, especially Istanbul, between 1969 and 2012. In telling the story of this one man's life, Pamuk tells a larger story that ultimately transcends geographical and cultural borders and is about the experience of being human in a rapidly changing world. Mevlut is an Everyman who doesn't exhibit strong character traits other than a general good-naturedness and an ability to get along with just about everyone, and that makes him a likable protagonist as well as a vehicle for portraying the personalities of other characters.. This is a long novel but not a difficult one. The narrative, told in the third person but also in part by the characters who address the reader, is fairly straightforward and generally chronological. The novel begins, however, with a central incident of the story, when Melvut is twenty-five years old and about to elope with a girl he fell in love with and had been writing love letters to for three years. After introducing us to the main character in that way, the author retells the story starting with Mevlut's move to Istanbul with his father at the age of twelve.. Mevlut, like his father, is a street vendor, a seller of boza, a slightly fermented drink popular in Turkey and the region, which becomes, in the course of the book, a symbol of traditional Turkish life and values. The story follows Mevlut through his school career and dreams of the future through his military service, marriage and a host of jobs and complicated family interactions. Mevlut's character is revealed early on in the story when, while eloping, he realizes that the girl he is about to marry is not the one he fell in love with. He has been duped and doesn't know whether his bride or her younger sister, the girl he thought he was marrying, were in on the trick. He is too considerate to even broach the question with his betrothed and, in fact, she becomes the true love of his life.. Pamuk is a master storyteller. He brings the city of Istanbul to life with characters that we get to feel we know. While Mevlut feels a strangeness in his mind as he walks the streets of his city and seeks to discover its essence as well as his own, through the course of this grand, mesmerizing novel, the characters and and setting become more familiar and less strange to us.","Oct 12, 2018"
55687370,Anna,"I want to give this 4.5 stars but as that's not an option, I rounded up.. As a boy, Melvut leaves his mother and sisters to go to work with his father and go to school in Istanbul. Praised for his intelligence and boyish good looks in his youth, Melvut is a little too pensive and easily led to follow his cousins and friend into relative financial success, but the musings in his mind, his agreeableness, and his love life are all more important to him.. The novel follows Melvut from his boyhood until he is a grandfather. It follows his life slowly, paying attention to particular days while jumping over years in other places. History is intertwined with the minutiae of everyday life: Melvut puts up political protest posters, watches terrorist attacks on television, notices how people abandon the old ways in favour of newer, international ways of living. The novel switches point of view, so we hear from the main players in the novel as if they were being interviewed - like real people, they choose to present information in different ways or leave crucial points out. The reader finds out what really happened through reading point of view on top of point of view (sometimes from the same person).. The novel is long, probably double the length of normal twenty-first century fare, but its length is important to the story. It is because it is long that the truth is able to build up slowly across different points of view. I really liked the way that people's point of view changed over their lives, sometimes as a result of the people who they were spending time with. It shows that no-one is happy at all stages in their lives, but they are also rarely unhappy at all stages too. I also liked the fact that I could look into the private lives of people whom I am unlikely to get to know in person (I felt when I was reading that I have met many men like Mevlut in my time but that they would never share their inner thoughts with someone like me). At times, I found the story a little slow but, as I've said above, I think this was deliberate. I also was not a fan of the ending, but as we were nearing it I couldn't figure out how it was going to end!","Dec 14, 2019"
98699591,Madhurima Das,"''There's a strangeness in my mind,"" said Mevlut. ""No matter what I do, I always find myself all alone in the world."". I'm going to remember this line for a very long time.. I wish I could rate this book a hundred stars! What a bookkkk!!!! This is the longest novel I've read till date and not once was I bored. I nearly blasted through in the second half. Such a simple yet intriguing storyline. I believe why I loved it so much is probably due to the relatable characters; they're so damn real! And the author has done an excellent job in fleshing them so perfectly that I felt like I know Mevlut, Rayiha, Samiha, Vediha, Ferhat, and a couple of other characters personally; not to mention crooked-necked Abdurrahaman Efendi whose mention and inner dialogues I found rather funny.. This is the story of Mevlut and a journey of his life from boyhood to old age in the backdrop of the various socio-economic and political changes that take place in Turkey, particularly around Istanbul spanning from the 1950s till the 2010s.. The book raises many visceral questions we all may have asked in her hearts at different times. Do we really get what we want and work for or is it all directed by an invisible outer force? This may very well have added to the relatibility factor.. However for me, the sweetest part of the story was Melvut and Rayiha's relationship. Their love made my heart escape and flutter around far away to all rare mansions of true love and come back a little bigger and hopeful.. The last line of the book! Ufffff!!!! It's the best ending line I've read in a novel. It's so fucking satisfying and memorable. Overall, this book, its characters, the lines, especially the one I've mentioned at the top and the last, are not going to let me go for a long time. I believe if I immediately start reading a new book right now, I'll be disrespecting the memory of this beautiful book :p I guess I'd love to revel in its hangover for a little longer :)","Aug 27, 2020"
18833660,Arnold Baruch,"I wish I could adopt the conversational tone that informs this long, tender-hearted yet tough and realistic combination of history and romantic intrigue. The protagonist is what Jewish people might call a shlemiel, unable or unwilling to make the tough decisions that lead to success in the world, yet he is ultimately a survivor, happier and better off in his dreamlike way than his familial competitors – this is a story about a family – and it's impossible not to like him. He works hard as a street merchant of boza, the traditional Turkish drink, and his love of wandering Istanbul's streets and neighborhoods is what reveals the city to us. He is tricked into a marriage, yet finds happiness there, then tragedy. Interestingly, Pamuk pulls telegraphs his punches (out of kindness to the reader?) so we are prepared for the tragedies that befall his characters. It's a measure perhaps of his confidence as a story-teller. The narrative style is also carefree – forget about POV: every character speaks in the first person, plus there's an omniscient narrator to fill in the gaps. I came away with a feeling for what Istanbul is, and strangely, it reminded me of my Tokyo, the intimacies, the drinking and bonding, the narrow streets and coffee shops, the evolution from post-war primitivity to modern anonymity. What will also remain is the sound I never heard, of the plaintive call of the boza seller, whose emotionality in his call is a measure of his soulfulness. Wait a minute, here is an example, though perhaps Mevlut's call was more beautiful when the story ends, as he was in his 50s then. But you must have the time for Melvut and his friends.

It's masterfully told tale of intrigue and human drama, of dreaming and loving, and letting go. Dreams fulfilled and dreams forsaken. Wasted lifes and wasted people, poverty and the struggle to make ends meet, life on the streets, but also the beauty in all of it. It's a captivating read, from the beginning to the end.. Mevlut knew that this yearning amounted to an overly optimistic view about the nature of friendship. The streets had taught him that past the age of thirty a man was always a lone wolf. If he was lucky, he might have a female wolf like Rayiha beside him. Of couse the onlt antidote to the loneliness of the streets was the streets themselves. The five years Mevlut had spent running the Binbom Café had kept him from the city, turning him into a man of sorrow. A Strangeness in My Mind. echoes.

32654424,Sreeraag Mohan,"'There is a strangeness in my mind', said Mevlut. 'No matter what I do, I feel completely alone in this world.. A Strangeness in My Mind. is a long and meandering account of the life of Mevlut Karatas, a boza-seller from Beysehir. The book follows Mevlut's life, and in a fashion that emulates human life, the storyline crawls, walks, and then runs towards a climax.. Though the storyline is not particularly gripping, I believe that is the reason why I was unable to put this book down: Mevlut is. all of us.. The narrative meanders through his thoughts and shines a light on family, love, struggle and politics, and Pamuk's prose brings the muddled thoughts of the everyman to life. The terrible tragedies that afflict every human: massacres, politics, calamities, deaths; all of them occur along the length of the novel, but Pamuk is quick to not dwell on any of it and the narrative ambles on, in yet another example of how Pamuk's prose mimics the human psyche.. Pamuk's undeniable love for Istanbul is on full display here, as the city gains a life of its own. The city provides a brilliant backdrop for the events of Mevlut's life, and Pamuk expertly articulates the subtle ways in which how everything is in a state of constant change, which one notices only if they are paying close attention.. Definitely not the best of Pamuk, for that title undeniably goes to. My Name is Red,. for fiction, and his non-fictional memoir,. Istanbul.. Nevertheless,.

108385604,Connor,"I had zero expectations going into this book. I only knew that Pamuk was Turkish (recommended by a Turkish friend) and that he had won a Nobel Prize for Literature. I did not expect to be hooked to this book... But I found it impossible to put down. Turks love drama. This is probably why in almost every chapter a curve ball is thrown in which builds the story or turns the narrative on it's head - in a great way. Mevlut's life (the protagonist) is narrated by Pamuk through real life events. He comes to Istanbul with his father in hope of the better life and job opportunities that most Turkish villagers seek in the city. He values tradition, or so you think... and follows his Dad's footsteps as a yoghurt seller through the streets of Istanbul. The items he sells change rarely. The city, people and attitudes around him change frequently. All other people involved in the story speak in first person accounts which adds a lot of personality to the book.. If you want a book to teach you a little about a world you probably don't know much about (as an English person), then this book is a great adventure into the perspective of Turks. They're great. What more can I say... Lively, opinionated when needed and conformist when needed. They do what needs to be done to survive, until, honour and pride get in the way.. I'm babbling. Basically it's a great book about sticking to the things, people and places you love no matter what changes around you or who tries to stop you.","Sep 10, 2020"
113251988,Sarah Smith,"I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't. The description intrigued me because I don't know much about Turkey or ifs culture. However, I found the story bland. There isn't really a plot it just follows the life of the main character Mevlut from childhood until his 50s.. My biggest criticisms of the book would have to be how it skipped over so many political conflicts and how the main character never seemed to be able to accomplish anything on his own. It would mention a military coup happened but not how it got to that point. More specifically, this bothered me a lot when in his childhood, his best friend Ferhat gets displaced, and it is just glazed over like ope never gonna see or hear from that one ever again. Throughout the entire story Mevlut was dependent on his cousins or friends for help to find jobs. He seemed to show little incentive to actually take steps to ensure a financially stable future.. Overall, I liked his writing style, but the lack of plot made it a very dull read. I almost gave up on reading it at several points and often found myself feeling annoyed at Mevlut. I didn't feel any deep connection to any character and most of his talks about the city seemed to be about how the architecture was changing.","Apr 25, 2020"
5184712,Carolyn,"Istanbul through most of the 20th Century as experienced by a man with a gentle spirit and even with people that take advantage of his goodness, and the times are so difficult, he manages to see the light in his life and provide comfort for so many people without realizing his impact. This is a clear picture of Istanbul and the culture that surrounds this country of Turkey.. My favorite side of the ""memoir"" although listed as a novel was his deep thoughts of what he means to the world and what people in his life need from him. He develops his strength from thoughts that are positive and indeed leave an imprint with family, friends, customers of his business (selling boza in the winter and a chickpea chicken dish in the summer), his daughters and their ability to achieve such a better life. This book leaves you feeling like there is good in the world no matter what is happening around you..

85007280,Hasan حسن,"This is the first book i read written by Orhan Pamuk. The book is beautiful account of an honorable and simple man, Mevlut, who moves from a small village near Konya to Istanbul with his father to earn his education and support his father as a street vendor.. The story revolves around how our protagonist painstakingly goes through secondary and high school education in Istanbul, how he falls in loves as he enters into adult life, how he learns to love his wife whom he runs away with only due to a comical misfortune, and how he stands by his principles despite the turmoils around him in his city and in his personal life.. Lovers of solitude might find a strange connection with our Mevlut. Mevlut hails from very humble beginnings in his early years at his village, contrasting with the adult Mevlut who finds refuge in the empty streets of Istanbul selling 'Boza' at night, surrounded by high rises everywhere.. The author also takes great care in detailing about changes to his beloved Istanbul over a span of 30 years as Turkey goes through a cultural and political upheaval..

2622618,Pranay Gupta,"A Strangeness in My Mind is a beautiful mosaic of love, loss, ageing, emotions and the journey that a city takes from it’s earlier cultural self, to the latter one of an ever growing sprawl of urban facades and tall ugliness. It is the story of Muvlut, our hero as the author lovingly calls him time to time, who ends up running away and marrying the elder lesser pretty sister of the girl he spent years writing love letters to, but accepts his fate because he wants to keep the elder sister’s honour. It’s never been in Mevlut’s nature to rebel against the hand fate has dealt. He’s also a hopeless romantic in that he tried to keep selling boza, years after he was treated as an ancient relic on the streets of Istanbul selling boza, but he continue to do it since that’s what he’s comfortable doing, and it suits his introvert self as compared to the other vocations where he would have to regularly interact with and depend on other people to get his work done. He also realizes towards the end that he has wholly and truly loved Rayiha, the elder sister who he ends up marrying. It is a beautiful book and would want to revisit some time later in life.","Jun 22, 2019"
1058939,Diane,"This novel by the famous Turkish author looks at the life of a man who migrants to Istanbul from a village in his youth, works as a street vendor, marries a girl from his village, and raises a family. He also becomes involved in Islamist politics, although that aspect of his life isn't explored in much detail. I thought the book provided an interesting contrast for the author, who usually writes historical novels or contemporary novels about wealthy people. He did a good job of putting together a sprawling family saga and describing life in Istanbul's slums as they started to develop. The characters were well-drawn and the plot was well-paced. The author had a tendency to change the narrator of the piece throughout, often having some of the supporting characters narrate a few paragraphs throughout the novel. This didn't work quite as well and was a bit confusing. Also, the first third of the book is an extended flashback that was a bit hard to follow as well. However, aside from this, I thought the book was very well-written and enjoyable, and also provided insight into a slice of Turkish life that may be unfamiliar to most readers.","Jun 16, 2020"
54035116,Sonia Francis,"A book to be read in sips and just enjoy.. Orhan Pamuk is a genius at his literary craft and after reading “Strangeness In My Mind”, it is my favorite out of the three of his books I have read: “Museum Of Innocence “, “My Name Is Red” and “The New Life”.. Pamuk’s respect for the elements of fiction and literary devices has rightly crowned him a winner of the Nobel prize in literature.. This novel is about love, family and country.. No one loves their city like Pamuk does. With beautiful elegiac sentences he takes you through the streets of Istanbul, you learn the culture, you taste the foods, you know all the neighbors. You just capture this city. From the beginning to the novel to the end, you experience the transformation from an old city to a modern one. With that said, nothing makes Melvut, the protagonist more happy than selling his “Boo-zaa”.. Melvut has eloped with the wrong sister and without spoilers, I dare you not to become engrossed in this novel. Family dynamics, cultural norms, politics and history is all served up here. I give this novel a whopping five stars.","Apr 17, 2019"
24698,Eric,"As a sucker for pleasantly long-winded family sagas with ambitious, expansive perspectives, ""Strangeness"" really hits the spots. Pamuk's rich treatment of Istanbul's modernization, while struggling to hold on to tradition, told thru a handful of characters straddling the old and the new, offers insight, smiles galore and plenty to ponder.. Our hero Mevlut is a bit of an innocent, especially in a rapidly modernizing world. His fundamental goodness sees him thru two happy marriages with two sisters (one of the many strangenesses) and innumerable financial obstacles. He is a naturally solitary man who nonetheless craves human contact. Mevlut unfailingly focuses on the bright side, while constantly being reminded of the dark. He recognizes the inevitability of ""progress,"" despite its negatives, and labors over the tension between intentions, thoughts, words and deeds (more strangeness).. In the end, Mevlut reconciles almost all, and finds a deeper comfort in his own skin than any of his far flung family.","Apr 18, 2020"
50863660,Shay,"A Strangeness in my Mind follows the life of a Turkish seller of (the traditional drink) boza from 1968 to 2012. I loved this novel and its naive and ever-optimistic hero Mevlut, who plies his trade, whether or not he needs to, because in roaming the streets of Istanbul, he feels truly alive. I learned a lot about the culture and politics of Istanbul over the last several decades, and the author’s love for the city really shines through - it’s as much a novel about Istanbul as about Mevlut. Whilst the author lets many of the other characters speak in the first person throughout the novel, somehow the third person narrative describing Mevlut ends up providing the most engaging parts of the story. Due to his essential good character, you can’t help rooting for Mevlut throughout.. The book did drag in parts, but I enjoyed it so much I’d have difficulty giving it less than 5 stars.. Whilst reading the novel, I tried the drink boza for myself, in Istanbul, and can highly recommend it!","Jun 11, 2018"

It was highly entertaining, and also literary. The character development was visible, and also very plausible, as we see the dynamic lives, intense emotions, and moral judgements that all these characters share with us.

31151678,Neerja Joshi,"A Strangeness in My Mind is a novel by Orhan Pamuk which tells the story of Mevlut a boza(a traditional Turkish drink) seller on the streets on Istanbul. Pamuk has an undeniable love for his city Istanbul, and this shows in his words and writings. The story revolves around Mevlut, but you hear other people's perspective too on the situation from time to time. The life and circumstances change for Mevlut, but he never leaves selling boza on the streets of Istanbul at night. The nighttime strolling brings peace to him from all the strangeness that goes inside his mind. The quote by Jean-Jacques Rousseau gets quoted ""I can only meditate when I am walking. When I stop, I cease to think; my mind works only with my legs."" to give you the essence of this night walking.

I really love Orhan's type of writing, it was my first book of him and I love his description of the old istanbul's parts. Maybe it's better if u have visited the city at least once, which is enough to fall in love with it like me, so afterwards it's amazing to imagining in my own head how the city looked like before, how small streets and little houses were, how dogs were always part of town as something magical and how it slowly raised into bigger and bigger city with all the human stories connecting to that..

After trying to get started on several books, this was the one who could quiet my mind and as I started reading while standing, i then found myself reading while sitting on a chair.. This is not a fast read: it follows the life of Mevlut, a poor village boy who moved to Istanbul with his father. Pamuk does an excellent job painting the canvas of Istanbul’s social and economic developments in the background of Mevlut’s story and the people he meets.. I learned from a dear friend that Pamuk is known for his mastery of telling stories from different characters’ perspectives. This art comes in the later parts of the book and really shines when some deeper conflicts arise between characters.. In all, it was a great read and time well spent.","Dec 03, 2017"
6758457,Hussam,"I am giving it three stars because it took me really long to finish this. It just sat there and sat there till I could find the time to get around to it. Don't get me wrong, it is a decent story. It revolves around the central character Mevlut who comes to the city Istanbul with his father to make it big. You learn alot about Turkish culture, the political, racial and religious fault lines that exist in the society. Mevlut follows the profession of his father which is selling boza, a kind of fermented drink. There is alot of eloping in this book. Everyone is running away with everyone and then they are just okay with it. Mevlut is just attached to the streets and his imagination runs wild as he walks around selling boza. That's why the story is called a Strangeness in my Mind. The characters are rich and the story keeps jumping around from different points of views.","Jun 18, 2018"
8838873,John Benson,"This novel brings out the the life of Mevlut, an immigrant from rural Turkey to Istanbul, and follows him from when he first arrived at age 12 and tells of his life there for the next forty years. Mevlut spends most of these years selling a drink called boza around the streets of Istanbul at night. The novel also brings out the different family dynamics within his own extended family and that of his wife's family. Mevlut, is about a year older than me and this added to my enjoyment of the novel to think about what I was doing at that same time in life. He is a very sympathetic, trusting, and loving individual and it was good to see his, his family, and Istanbul's story told from the late 1960s through the early 2000s. I have read quite a few of Orhan Pamuk's novels and books and this one though almost 600 pages is one of his most accessible.","Mar 31, 2020"
36209320,Betty Confetti,"Old Man and the Sea, Turkish style....the long journey of Mevlut through life, and the up's and down's and coming to a complete understanding of the gift of love, opportunity, how good can come from evil, and the wanted and often unwanted connections with family. I am also reminded of the Egyptian Trilogy by Mahfouz....seeing Turkish life for what it is, the customs, the way that life in a known place changes, and in the process we keep what was always ours, and find also a new identity. I found many hooks in this book to keep me reading onward. The translation, at times, is a bit hokey. I think in particular of a passage using the word ""nerd"" which was just so out of place. But also the ending, so lovely, unexpected, sad. joyful, and yet also so very lasting as these days afterward unfold.","Apr 20, 2020"
54784704,Diana,"I did not enjoy ‘A Strangeness in my Mind’.. The story is too long and has too many characters. It’s a tedious and repetitive read.. Mevlut lives many years and we see him growing old but not growing internally. He was an honest person surrounded by people who, like him, were migrants from the villages to Istanbul and while the rest of them grew rich or at least they've got to live well, Mevlut always lived a mediocre life. He stuck obstinately to the old ways and never really adjusted himself to the dynamic changing rhythm of Istanbul.. The corrupted ways of the people in the restaurant where he worked, as well as the electricity meter readers, the taxi drivers and the rampant bribes only reinforce the stereotype of untrustworthy character of people from countries such as Turkey.. It's disappointing to read such a long book with long descriptions that convey no meaningful ideas.","Apr 25, 2020"
35955757,John Ihor Campagna,"Great as a portrait of change in Istanbul from after WWII to today. The economic, social and political development of the city is always hinted at without being directly analyzed with a critical eye as major events just occur in ways they do most lives. A whole family of characters is presented and fleshed out somewhat although none come out as particularly memorable except for Istanbul itself and the mostly simple minded hero Mevlut. The struggle and joys of existence in a still poor, but gradually developing country from the perspective a poor street vendor was my greatest interest in the book. I also now have an immense desire to try boza and raki with references to either on every other page.","Jan 20, 2017"
16827924,Jason Makansi,"You get a wonderful sense of modern and recent day Turkey and Istanbul in this rather delightful novel, especially the view from below (the less affluent) looking up, in the same way as the big Russian novels, but I have to be honest, at 600 pages (the vintage paperback edition), it's breath kind of gives out before the end. It's just too long. The protagonist, Mevlut, is kind of a Don Quixote type, who seems to make the most of every bad situation, including getting tricked into marrying the sister of the woman he thought he was in love with. It is written with kind of a unique structure in that multiple characters frequently come ""on stage"" to offer parallel POVs on the current action. I suspect this will bother some readers but I quite enjoyed it.","May 13, 2017"
5778766,Jason,"I'm not sure what to make of this book, a 40-year story about a family in Istanbul, Turkey. Parts of the story were sweet but parts seemed rather long and unnecessary. Probably the most interesting thing about A Strangeness in My Mind is how the city, quite possibly the real protagonist of the book, slowly changes and grows along with the family. In this, Pamuk does a wonderful job of leading the reader through a winding 40 year sub-story of a smaller, quainter old-world city that is hurled into the 21st century with all it's complications: poverty, political and religious tension, pollution, the excess of wealth, crime and corruption, and the urban sprawl containing it all. I give the book two and a half stars.","Jun 05, 2017"
5611563,Tim Tillack,"At first I struggled with this novel. The Turkish names of people and places were unpronounceable in my mind, and the city of Istanbul was foreign and unknown. But having grown up reading fantasy where the names are fantastical, I plowed on. The story is set in Istanbul, Turkey and spans four decades of Mevlut's life in the city. The narrative is structured through shifting first person perspectives, which all revolve around Mevlut's relationships with his family. I could write more, but ultimately, this is a very intimate novel, perhaps one of the most up close and personal studies of a character's life I've read in a long time. Pamuk is clearly concerned with the tensions between the private and public.","Oct 24, 2017"
35339408,Avishek Chatterjee,"Was wonderfully insightful about how Turkey as a nation and it's population has changed in all but the basic ambition to have a better life.. Melvut is ambition. From the backwaters of a rural village, he dreams of Istanbul's rosy lips. But life is hardly fair, as he finds out fairly early. But this street vendor has dreams and like most of the characters in this book, he finds his own voice even as the streets and people around him change with the tides of time.. Pamuk crafts a wonderful story of a city and it's people and guides the readers into this world not by the scolding touch of a tell it all, but with the warm and humorous voices that litter this novel as he says, ""Welcome to life, my friend - have a wonderful time no matter what!""","Jan 23, 2018"
4730679,Nisma,"Bahh. I don't know. At first, when I finished reading, it was like waking up from a dream; emerging from some parallel universe. It was so easy to be immersed, keeping up with the politics, the relationships, to feel that melancholy as Istanbul evolved throughout. So yes, 5 stars straight up.. And then I was ambivalent. What did I really get from this? I haven't a clue. I couldn't really. categorise. it - is this a love story? A kind of drama, historical fiction? It was so long-winded, convoluted, and.... strange. . Duh. So I downgraded that rating.. But then, I can't stop thinking about it, trying to understand the people, kind of longing to slip back into the streets of Istanbul, into the mind of Mevlut - heck, everyone. I want to figure it out, and just be there, all at once. Any author that can leave you with that kind of feeling deserves five, ten, a hundred stars.","Jan 27, 2018"
31481662,Paulo Jan ,"Pamuk is my favorite writer , no doubt about it.. This time , describing the life of Turks that migrate from villages to Istanbul , searching for better conditions.. It was interesting to compare with the situation , the way it happens here in Brazil : informal jobs , the uprise and grow of slums . So similar ..... Once again , Pamuk has no fear of mentioning the persecutions of Christians and Jews in his country , in 1955 and 1964.. But what I appreciated the most were those funny weddings that took place.. Istanbul was again a good protagonist , and for those as me , who knows the city , was great to understand the transformations it suffered along the century XX that resulted in the actual shape.. Worths reading!","Jun 24, 2018"
16835826,Kim Shively,"There are two main characters in this epic novel: Mevlut the Boza-seller and Istanbul itself. Mevlut is a rural-to-urban migrant who both keeps his rural ways (who sells boza in the streets in the 2000s?) and is transformed as Istanbul itself is transformed around him. We see not only the influx of migrants from all parts of Anatolia over the decades from the 1960s to the 1990s, but the novel also portrays the rise and fall of political factions, mafia groups, real estate moguls, and price gougers of all kinds. In the middle is Mevlut who doesn't want the world to change, even as it does so dramatically, and whose inner core seems as steadfast as could be possible in such a shifting landscape. For lovers of Turkey and of Istanbul, this is a novel for you.","Mar 14, 2019"
23169767,Harsh Jain,"Pamuk touches deeply. He'll set your emotions bleeding with his description of the faintest of feelings that a character seems to have been subtly feeling. So, it's always subtle. The feelings always doubtful, unsure, like 'A strangeness in the mind' that is inexplicable. But it's always TRUE. It's true because you have felt it as well. Thought about it as well. You are certain that that is what must go on in the life of that person at that time in that situation.. Then, Pamuk is also able to present all the different perspectives of a scene by different characters in entertaining and realistic, and empathetic depth.. BTW I mostly heard it on audible and read parts of it. And the narration by John Lee. And he was consice and clear.","Mar 28, 2019"
6744338,Sanja Knezovic,"Mevlut, Rayiha, Samiha and other characters told a brilliant, yet simple story of Istambul , its residents and changes in them and in their city . While Mevlut repeatedly shouts ""Boza"" with his lovely voice, earning money as a street vendor and 50 years (600 pages) pass, many things happen - romance, love, envy and death. The art of writing evoked the same feelings as books by other Nobel Prize winners, like Ivo Andric or Jose Saramago. There is something calming in Mevlut's daily rituals, and I think that all of us have felt a stranegeness in our minds at some point in our lives - doubts, convictions, crazy ideas, melancholy, and decisions that may go right or wrong. This novel is not just a love story , it is a story about human nature and a master piece.","Jun 12, 2019"
5928378,Lisa,"I loved this book. It was written from the perspective of Mavlut, who had moved from his small village to Istanbul as a young boy. He and his father worked as boza sellers, and he continues this traditional work into 2012. What was fascinating and so enjoyable about this story was the innocence and simple approach he had to life, throughout his description of living through a military coup, major earthquake, and political-religious transformation and shifts in traditional to modern values, without passing judgement on the events he experienced. I felt like I had walked into his day to day life and struggles and understood his cultural experience, although it is not a society I know well. This is the third book I have read by Orhan Pamela and can’t wait to read the next.","Jul 04, 2019"
80599681,Marcos,"I experienced the joy of reading this book while abroad in Istanbul- on the ferries, in Taksim Square, in the unique cafes lining the cobblestone streets of Beyoğlu and beyond. So, at times, it was a surreal literate journey.. It begins as a compelling enough story as a young boy becomes a man in a the big ever-changing and growing city. The search for identity takes him through the winding streets of Istanbul, and examines the cultural, political, social and physical landscape of (what I saw and felt) one of most fascinating cities in the world.. Unfortunately, after 400 pages or so, the story becomes disjointed (in my opinion) and the characters uninteresting. Nevertheless, it was quite enjoyable until, well, until it wasn’t.","Aug 27, 2019"

As they rush to catch a train to Istanbul Mevlut realises he has been misled. But the die is cast and the situation will determine the rest of his days.. Over the next four decades in Istanbul, Mevlut works various jobs to support his loving wife and family; work that gives him a special perspective on his rapidly changing city and the people who live there. And every evening he walks the streets, selling his wares and dreaming his dreams","Mar 11, 2020"
1430273,Silver,"A delightful and at times tragic tale of love, loss melancholy and yearning. It wonderfully depicts the clash between generations as two different worlds, the old and the new collide. A story of those trapped in the middle of these two different worlds trying to survive while holding to the old traditions they value as all that is familiar to them slowly slips away.. The author draws the reader into a different culture, illuminating a whole new world while still speaking of things which are familiar to many people regardless of background.. A tale that is bittersweet and fabulously rendered.","Feb 23, 2017"
14731522,David Baker,"Gosh, I really wanted to like this book. And I sort of did. I did enjoy it. But it is long. Very long. Very, very long. I'm all for a good story, but really, after a while, I just couldn't keep going with this and had to give up about half way through. One can only cope with so much yogurt selling without too much else happening for page after page. And then some more pages. There were some quite funny parts in it - I wondered if it had lost some of its humour in translation from Turkish into English. And there wasn't anything to dislike. I can see it is a great work. But perhaps just not for me. Also, did I mention how very very long it is?","Mar 02, 2017"
66157000,Ameya Kolhatkar,"The first Orhan Pamuk book that i chose to read. Don't regret it one bit.. Although the protagonist's adolescence years were kinda slow and too detailed, I found the rest of the book quite enchanting. It compasses the journey of a simple man through a rapidly changing changing city and society.. His life is difficult, and yet he is a happy man clinging on to what he likes to do best despite the society's wavering fancy in his vocation. And yet in the end when things finally work for him, he is left with strangeness in his mind: a strangeness so profound that it questions the reader's belief in fate, destiny and happiness.","Feb 13, 2018"
10985835,Finitha Jose,"I am still undecided as to whether I liked this or not, probably because it took a long time to complete. The book is bulky for sure (around 600 pages), but I was never a slow reader. Well, some books are to be chewed and digested and safe to say this one belongs to that Baconian category.. Like a gifted painter, Pamuk takes extreme pains to portray the growth and change of not only the characters but also the background or setting in this case. Spanning from 1968 to 2012, it covers a large chunk of Turkish history focusing on Istanbul. Hard to say which was given prominence, Istanbul or Mevlut.. I was more into the story of Mevlut than to Istanbul and so the whole book appeared to follow the pattern of an ECG reading -- there will be a spike, then a recess and again a spike in interest. There are only a handful of characters, but each of them shows evolvement and represent a specific aspect of the city. Mevlut, as the boza seller, embodies the old days of the city when alcohol was not freely available. It brings a nostalgia which I am sure everyone can associate with in spite of their country of origin. No choco bar can replace the feelings of those old ice cream sellers who used to come to our neighbourhood with their ding dong bells.. So four stars for I won't be forgetting this story anytime soon. The narration is unique with other characters intervening to give their version of the story. Obviously, the core of the novel revolves around the strangeness that haunts Mevlut. Whom has he loved - Samiha to whom he wrote for three years or Rayiha who got all the letters and whom he married? I am happy that the novel ends with Mevlut's answer instead of leaving it to the mercy of readers..

61384542,Pshpshmysh,"For the first 50 pages, it did not interest me. After a couple of weeks, I decided to start reading anew and something changed - this book captivated me completely. It is so soul-stirring - my heart was trembling every so often. I cannot remember a time when a book made me stand on an escalator with the finished book in my hands and feel so acutely alive and, somehow, hollow.. For me, it is the book about the sacrifice that causes your love and your self grow. It is about the purity of the intentions and thought that make you both vulnerable and strong throughout your life. It is about life itself that may seem simple and insignificant but still is memorable and teaching and full.","Jul 11, 2018"
69694243,Boris,"Often stories are written about ambitious, successful, heroic and sorts of extraordinary characters. However, Orhan Pamuk writes about an everyday man. There’s nothing extraordinary about this man, except for the strangeness in his mind. The author is true to present human’s feelings as it is, never dramatising any scene.. Even though the book was long, and kept it down to read several other books, at the back of my mind I always wanted follow Mevlut down the streets of Istanbul, through slums as his story entwined with others and unfolded. If you are patient enough to finish the book, you’d com to love the boyish faced Mevlut","Mar 01, 2019"
6348232,Jason,"My favorite of Pamuk's books I've read so far, but it feels like at some point the kind of hokey plot and some of the really ludicrous characters (like Suleyman) get in the way of the setting, which is in this story and in all the Pamuk stories I've read the main character. The story is at its best when Mevlut is allowed to have events work through him, and it's at its most unnecessarily complicated when the story is told by others or when Pamuk remembers the plot needs to be furthered along. I was mesmerized by about the first half of the book but in the last half I just wanted it to be over.","May 03, 2019"
4547078,Beth,"A Strangeness in My Mind is a love letter to Istanbul. It is a beautifully composed work of art that brings to life the ever changing streets of Istanbul between 1954-2012 and the quiet, yet powerfully meditative life of its protagonist and boza seller, Mevlut.  Pamuk is a master of the written word. His writing hits all the senses and illuminates the soul. The insightful development of his characters, particularly Mevlut, is fraught with beauty, angst, depth and symbolism. His bird's-eye time-lapsed view of Istanbul, as it evolves from year to year, is played out magnificently through his cast of varied characters. They serve as distinct counterpoint to Mevlut’s stubborn and complex relationship with past and present. Pamuk’s love for his city rings out as melodiously as the boza seller’s voice on his nightly odyssey through the streets of Istanbul. A quiet, yet powerful novel. Once again, Pamuk fails to disappoint his besotted readers.","May 01, 2017"
15795462,André,"Trying to keep things short, contrary to the book: Incredible kaleidoscope of (family) life in and around Istanbul through the years. The fact that the protagonist is such a nice and likeable man while family politics and real politics unfold around him, all of this over the course of fifty-odd years and more than 590 pages, mean that a) I really wished he'd grow some balls every now and then and b) I cannot help but feel that cutting about 150 pages from the manuscript wouldn't have hurt and would possibly have increased the impact of the book.","May 22, 2017"
5056931,Tina Smalcelj,"What an incredible read!. I read it for a long time. The time that books like this often demand. At moments I hated it. It seemed it will never end and I would get bored by the slow pace of Pamuk's boza seller Mevlut, but it was such a great experience. It's a great story of Istanbul, story of change and story of love. It's story of life that goes on and it is the same everywhere.. And yeah, Istanbul will look completely different to me when I visit it next time. And I will be looking for that one, lonely boza seller walking down the street.","Sep 02, 2017"
15065922,Heather Fryling,"How do I even begin to explain how wonderful this book is? It's a window into the life and loves and family and ups and downs of a poor street vendor in Istanbul. There's a case of mistaken identity, a murder, jealousy, a saint, betrayal, and through it all family, loyalty, a sweet sentimentality. For me, A Strangeness in My Mind was especially illuminating, because I don't know much about life beyond the bounds of the occidental, and this book gave me a window into a culture very different from my own.","Nov 30, 2017"
2095936,Marilyn,"Excellent historical fiction novel which captures the essence of the main character, a yogurt seller in Istanbul. He observes major cultural changes during his lifetime. He processes his surroundings based on his limited education, escaping into daydreams to create excitement and variety in his day. The political changes in Turkey during the 60's through 90's confuse him, yet he longs to fully understand. His heart and intentions are easy to align with, and I found myself missing him days after I turned the final page. Pamuk's writing continually amazed me.","Dec 16, 2017"

17832463,Lama,"The book is a long description of the life of a naive and simple character, who though given multiple opportunities to grow or change, doesn't. I didn't like the development of the characters, the author could write pages and pages just to reflect a single idea. What I enjoyed in the book were the politcal and historical aspects. Pamuk describes the changes in Istanbul's population and skyline and the politics behind the changes. Beyond that, the book was a time-waster and the ending was as naive and simple as the character.","Apr 22, 2018"
21024711,Robert,"Wonderful story of family life in Turkey over several decades of huge social and economic change. Every chapter brought back memories of living in northern Greece in the 60s, and how similar many of the events in the story were to stories from Greece over those same years. The religious differences are mainly trivial between the two societies. The hard scrabble of rural life, transported to urban madness plays true in this book. It reminded me of the Cairo Trilogy by Naguib Mahfouz, though with a more subtle humorous side.","Feb 20, 2019"
27904795,Emily,"The last chapter is very beautiful - although this book is about the life of one street vendor of Istanbul, it really spoke to a mixed sentiment felt by many around the developing world as urbanization and globalization took place in the past 30 years. The economic opportunities and the influx of immigrants brought about a new set of norms. This book looked at the amazement, the nostalgia, the confusion, the sense of loss, the recalibration felt by an individual who lived through these drastic changes.","Feb 20, 2019"

Unlike the other Pamuk book I read before this one: Museum of Innocence- this turned out to be a 'classic' for me, and a Real introduction into the greatness of Pamuk.. I absolutelly loved it, and was eager to follow the life of Mevlut and his family over the years every time I had the chance to read it!. It really uses Pamuk's famous magical realism, but in an original way, and is very through also, if you want to learn about the city of Istambul and Turkish society, but this does not 'ruin' the main story nevertheless.. Very much recommended!","Jul 22, 2019"

It is a truly artwork. It's written with a clever aspect of the story-telling. It makes you part of Mevlüt Karataş family from upper generation to the sibling ones. The each story that Orhan Pamuk worth to mention is feels like an actual story that we face in everyday life. It changes my mindset and few of the thinking principles. Nothing more can be told about his style.. He is an Nobel prize winner in literature, period.","Aug 18, 2019"

Through the lives of the characters around Mevlut's life, I have come to a more thorough understanding how a relationship between the city and its people works. Sometimes full of awes, sometimes full of predicaments, most of the times it is a tight rope of compromises ready to strangulate us, the people of the city itself.. It's a magnificent piece of work that surely will captivate anyone who falls into the coming of age kind of narrative.. PS: Actually, I'll go with 3,5/5 if only the system allows.","Apr 14, 2020"

The main character, Mevlut, is a decent man of ordinary ability trying to find his place in the big city of Istanbul, to which his father brought him as a young boy. You experience the city with him as he marries, has daughters, suffers loss, keeps going, ages. It's not the fastest or easiest read, but it plants a seed in your memory. I suspect I'll be remembering it well into the future. It's personal, political, universal. Will read more by this author.","Jul 29, 2020"
45574381,Mary Clarkson,"This story of the life of a village boy coming to Istanbul, his extended family and his relationship with the city was fascinating and moving. Sometimes though I thought the storyline wasn’t strong enough to justify such a long novel. Also, the title is slightly misleading: Whilst Mevluk’s dreams about the city become confused with reality he is nevertheless one of the most transparently sane, balanced and decent fictional heroes with very little actual strangeness in his mind. The book is moving and well written but doesn’t warrant the length.","Aug 29, 2020"

This is a lengthy, full of description book. You need patience and a desire to really understand in order to finish.

Mevlut has a curiosity about people and why things occur yet he just lets life happen to him. I enjoyed discovering the history and growth of Istanbul spanning 40 years - all as seen from Mevlut's family. The book is so well written and poetic - yet I needed something more upbeat at this time in my life - that's why 3 stars instead of 4.","Aug 17, 2017"
1360420,Arinamidalem,"I am glad Pamuk took me to see Istanbul from old days to current days.. Also to get to see its people, it is like watching my-big-fat-greek-wedding, so many characters show up in the story.. We are brought to witness Mevlut life from childhood, marriage life, domestic life problem, until he lost the love of his life. I love the last part when Mevlut think about Rahiya, or maybe what Pamuk think of Istanbul. :)","Sep 30, 2017"
13316114,Sandra,"It always takes me time to read out Pamuk's books. But it is always such a pleasure to enter his storytelling world. This one is a story of an simple boza seller and his family. But also, as usual, a story of Istanbul. It is beautiful read right through. I also finally got arranged marriage explained properly 😉😉😉. ""But I think it must be easier for a girl to marry someone she doesn’t know, because the more you get to know men, the harder it is to love them.""","Oct 15, 2017"
28914878,Jaimi Titherington,"This book was beautiful, it had such intricate and elaborate detail. I thought the transitioning narrator brought an interesting aspect to the story, and I found myself distrustful of parts of each of their versions of events. I thought the writing was rich, and it doesn't surprise me that this was on the list for the Man Booker Prize.. I found myself both rooting for Mevlut, and wanting to shake him. Wonderfully crafted!","Feb 06, 2018"
39134645,Cathy T,"This is a tome of a book weighing in at 740 pages or so. It is about a part of the world about which I knew very little, the characters are quite ordinary, and yet I was mesmerised and entranced by the story of Mevlut. If defining characteristics of a good book are that it makes you want to explore a different part of the world, understand more (for example about the history of a nation) and reflect again and again upon completion, then this is definitely a strong candidate.","Apr 16, 2018"
8733845,Rajat,"The review on the cover read - 'life-affirming storytelling at it's finest', and it indeed was an experience to read the story through all it's characters Melvut, Rahiya, Samiha, Vediha, Korkut, Suleyman, Crooked-neck Abdurrahman and others. The story of an everyday men, his life, dreams, imaginations and struggles seeped in my heart with extraordinary fluency.and so elegantly that I felt that I was the boza-seller in the streets of Istanbul. Such was the brilliance of Orhan Pamuk's narration.","Jun 25, 2018"
54290438,Kari Ni,"A book about the dreamer Mevlut, whose social 'strangeness' turns out to be his moral triumph. While the people around him aim at great fortune, money and power at a high cost, the character lives in his own world exploring new dimensions of his vivid imagination and following his own moral principles. The book leaves a scent of hope for the power of life and its unpredictable ways of giving us more, while taking away everything we thought we needed.","Sep 03, 2018"
372881,Masha,"Everything is much more connected and interconnected that you imagined. While I am still very far to know much about the contemporary history of Turkey, the book carefully strung in the ""bigger"" events in the narrative to only slightly push forward the plot but not being intrusive at all. The pace of the book might be slow for someone but I think in the end it worked out well. Despite careful work of the author, I still think the ending could be better. But endings are always the hardest 惟終實難.","Oct 30, 2018"
72987076,Saliha Ozis,"I loved the way how Orhan Pamuk enriches the protagonist Mevlut, a ""simple character"" for most of us. I really enjoyed reading Orhan Pamuk's narrations and transitions on how Mevlut feels about himself and the worlds he lives through the concept of ""stranges in his mind"". In addition, I got to know more about the supporting characters since the author explains events from their point of views and this populates Mevlut's world and helps the story move along.","Dec 23, 2018"
630958,Jenny,"A musing on life, cities (Istanbul), development, social class differentiation, migration, and more, from an urban philosopher, such a good man. A true love story, he ponders the difference between actions and intentions, and which count for more. It was a little tedious at time, but the main character is so pure and likeable, I wanted to champion him when he wasn't doing it well enough for himself!","Feb 21, 2019"
90727097,Asad Khan,"Its a long journey.You travel with Mevlut,the protagonist,you laugh and cry with Mevlut.He is a strange character,at least for Orhan Pamuk.but when you delve into his life you wont find anything strange.the story flows smoothly with little turns and twists.Boza selling remains a permanent part of protagonist’s life.you will definitely enjoy it if you like poetry.you wont find any hidden meanings in between lines.it is a simple story worth reading.","Jun 17, 2019"
91807292,Tanya B,"Unfortunately I chose to read this book at a time when I didn't have any time to read a book. Once I could finally sit down and read, I enjoyed this book. History is woven with a love story and the realities that come with family powers and jealousies. I found myself gasp aloud, cry, and reflect as I read this story. Luckily there is a family tree included, as sometimes I was lost with names and relationships. I would recommend this story, and am curious by some other titles by the author.","Aug 20, 2019"
135754,Carol,"This incredibly loooong book, with a strangely quiet and meandering style, somehow kept me engaged throughout. It's hard for me to say exactly how it did it, especially since this is a very male-perspective narrative. And yet, somehow, I think this story, which definitely took me to places I have never been, will be one of the books I remember most from this year. It's a book about place, about time, and people living unremarkable lives as history happens.","Dec 20, 2019"
110268417,Mikaela Balkind,"The storyline and characters initially interested me but about 400 pages in the story began to drag on without much excitement. The main character was charismatic and it was intriguing to learn about the life of a boza seller, but very little occurs throughout the story that leaves a lasting impression on the reader.. I would recommend this book to anyone who has visited Istanbul, as it was a exciting to recognize the neighborhoods and areas mentioned but other than that I would not recommend this book to other readers unfortunately.","Feb 17, 2020"
108511335,Graeme Whitton,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed several previous Orhan Pamuk books I was looking forward to this one but I found it quite challenging. As ever he manages to beautifully evoke the sounds and sights of Istanbul but the novel covers a significant period of time and is populated by a large cast of characters. As a result I found numerous passages very sprawling while adding little to the story. I still look forward to reading more of his stuff, though.","Mar 06, 2020"
135742,Alison Giese,"I'm a little baffled by all the great reviews. It wasn't terrible, but I just found it dull. OK, so the guy sells yoghurt. I get it. Oh, he's still selling yoghurt? OK, that's good to know. Oh, he met some people while selling yoghurt? Alrighty then.. I actually thought the book started out strong and that I was going to like it, but then I got bored. I decided to give up after listening to the audiobook for four hours. It took me nearly three weeks to get through those four hours!","Mar 21, 2020"

As I don’t see many of those in modern novels, I treated this book as a real pearl.. .... The lecture had a therapeutic effect on me. I loved those moments when I fully immersed myself into the reality described in the book. I was literally roaming around main streets of Istanbul together with Mevlut. I am so sad the book is over.","Apr 19, 2020"
106882829,Sibel,"This is my first meeting with Orhan Pamuk's style and I can say that I totally liked it! He has a simple but fascinating writing style. You feel like you are walking with Mevlut in Istanbul streets. The book doesn't only tell us the story of Mevlut but also the political, economic and sociological changes of Turkey and Istanbul, like a storyboard... I can not say he is totally objective but still, I liked this novel.","Apr 25, 2020"
8073061,Mohit Bhatia,"I had two expectations from this book. Both were not met.. 1. Most such books should be able to transport you to the city or town they are set in . This book never really transported me there although it tried.. 2. I failed to find something to love the protagonist or even find something to hate him ..I did not find anything to relate to him in any which way .. Set over four decades, I struggled a bit to finish reading it. I expected more given the credentials of the author.","Jul 31, 2020"
30125759,Margot Firth,"An intriguing journey at first, through the ancient meet modern Istanbul and also, the workings of the mind, to find true happiness.

Not the easiest of reads with it's time shifts but well worth the trip.","Dec 30, 2016"
5661042,Helena R-D,A story of a street vendor that captivated me so strongly that I read it every moment I had free. It's both the story of an Everyman and Istanbul. How they both change throughout the years and have this tender and well hidden depth to them.. Mevlut is an honest man and his life isn't filled with adventure or riches. His quiet dignity is what makes his story captivating instead.. An amazing read.,"Mar 18, 2017"

I imagine if you're 35 or 45 and have more than 2 decades worth of experience with life, actually having a family that's not just your pet, and handling real and significant setbacks this will be a more worthwhile read.. So I'll probably reread this when I'm 40.","Aug 22, 2017"
47040281,Aukse,"Enjoyable piece to read for those who are interested to know how Istanbul was developing: it covers migration from Anatolian villages to cities, presents the types of jobs that those newcomers took, describes in which districts they lived... But that's not all. Pamuk also tells a life and love story of a good man called Mevlut.. It made me to think: is it worth to be a good man in those days?","Aug 26, 2017"
8216403,John,"Another rich weave of characters, culture, and circumstance. The protagonist is a simple, honest, and hardworking man.

5995578,Paresh Khatri,Absolutely brilliant. There is an acute sense of loss that one feels after finishing any of Pamuk’s works; ‘A strangeness in my mind’ is no exception.

Nothing ”great”.","Nov 30, 2017"
55176189,Marshall,"OUTSTANDING BOOK. I am completely blown away by this book. It's so dense and large, written like an epic, and the story is so human.

If you aren't reading this, what are you doing? Read it. It's life changing.","Dec 18, 2017"
40354089,Arturo Hernández,"I appreciate the writing style of Orhan during this book. The way the story is told as if all the characters are together in a room telling their version of what really happened. It’s engaging during the first half, however there were some chapters that took me out of the main plot (regarding religion and war). Overall, I liked reading about Mevlut and his nostalgic life in Istanbul.","Feb 18, 2018"
17554033,Rosemary,"Translated from Turkish. Set in Istanbul and the surrounding small towns. It is the story of one man from his coming of age to an old man. He makes a lot of mistakes along the way, but he lives by strong ethics. There is a delightful love story that could have easily been tragic. The culture of Turkey is prominent and the food is key. Our man is a yogurt seller on the streets.","Mar 23, 2018"
77899882,Hale Nur,"Overall, this novel is an epic history of modern Turkey. I read almost all of the books of Pamuk, this is the one that made me cry most. Perhaps there were some extra factors like my age, experiences etc., but still, I think Pamuk's storytelling peaks in Kafamda Bir Tuhaflık. Pamuk subtly elaborates into chronic issues of Turkey, like political polarization, migration and urbanization.","Apr 05, 2018"
79191615,Whiskey,"Avoid tourist traps. Eat with the locals. See Istanbul through the eyes of a street vendor. “Boza seller, come on up!” Reveal Istanbul to me, from its ghettos to the shores of the Bosporus. The title and subtitle of the book summarize the story well: “A Strangeness in My Mind: Being the Adventures and Dreams of Mevlut Karatas, a Seller of Boza, and of His Friends, and also a Portrait of Life in Istanbul Between 1969 and 2012 from Many Different Points of View.”. Stretch out your hands. Grasp the palms of a street vendor and a Nobel-Prize-winning author. Let them introduce you to the identity of Istanbul, reflected in the daily lives of its denizens. Reader, your guides will escort you across 40 years and allow you to see Istanbul from the perspective of the working class as their city becomes a megalopolis, balancing modernity with its religious and cultural heritage.. Clasp Mevlut’s hand. He is a humble street vendor, who meditates as he walks and sells boza (a fermented beverage). Mevlut dreams small dreams, hoping to own his own home and to educate his daughters. He is a happy man, despite his sorrow, his disappointment, and his strangeness. Mevlut feels the familiar world in an unfamiliar way. The comprehension of Mevlut’s “strangeness” is at the heart of the novel’s mystery.. Nobody accuses Mevlut of bravery, yet he has the courage to live with goodwill toward everyone and to find a way to relate to all the factions that compose Turkey across 40 years. He feels affection for the people he meets, and he, unknowingly, charts a “Righteous Path”--a middle path between arguing factions: Islamists; modernists; criminal gangs; nationalists; leftists; capitalists; and petty in-laws. Mevlut identifies with all, but, despite his sociability, he nurtures the introvert within. He feels a disquieting strangeness that will not be silenced. Mevlut knows he is different but cannot grasp how. Why does he feel like a stranger to the city he has walked for 40 years? Why does he dream of dogs chasing him through cypress-treed cemeteries?. Take Pamuk’s hand. Pamuk is a good-natured writer who neither scolds nor moralizes. He writes for readers who will make an effort to understand and to identify with somebody who stands apart from the reader's culture and class. He requests our compassion for his characters before we make cultural or political judgments upon them. He gives us a social novel, reminiscent of 19C naturalism, which attempts to show us the lives of working-class people, trying to love their spouses and raise a family amidst military coups, the rise of Islamists, Kurdish-Turkish fights, bribery and corruption, and of course the frenzy of real estate speculation.. Pamuk chronicles his epic in simple and clear language, shorn of lyrical embellishment. Despite its complexity and large cast, I always understood what was happening. Pamuk uses a third-person limited narrator to describe Mevlut’s life; however, other characters interrupt the primary narrative by directly addressing the reader to correct the main narrator and to justify themselves in comical ways.. The plot centers on the mystery of Mevlut’s marriage to Rayiha. Mevlut was smitten with the youngest of three sisters, whom he saw at a wedding party. He then spent three years writing her love letters, only to end up eloping with the wrong sister. Even though he marries the older (and uglier) sister, he loves his wife all the more. Mevlut’s love for Rayiha defies romantic idealization and develops instead from the shared experiences of surviving with her, fighting with her, and raising children with her. Did Mevlut intend those letters for his wife, Rayiha, or his beautiful sister-in-law? Would he admit it? Was Mevlut deceived? If so, who conspired against him? Do our intentions or actions hold greater significance? Does life unfold haphazardly through random mistakes or does fate (Kismet) control our destiny? (Witness the shaky evolution of Istanbul shantytowns into gleaming skyscrapers and see if you are any closer to the answer.). We tell ourselves lies in order to live. Some lies are smaller than others. But there is a gulf between our public personas and our private personas that mimics that of the illusions of the city itself. Indeed, this same dishonesty applies to boza (the fermented beverage Mevlut sells), which is a central metaphor of the book. Boza vendors and customers must deny boza’s alcoholic content because drinking alcohol is forbidden in Islam. It is a gentle lie, told so life can be enjoyed without the sinner’s guilt. Let us visualize Mevlut selling his boza that he carries on a long pole, balanced across the back of his shoulders, like a yoke. On each side of the pole dangle chains that hold large jugs of boza. Thus, the boza vendor resembles a set of scales and helps us to visualize how we must forever balance the public and private along with the truth and fiction of our identity.. May those who suffer in love find it in the end. May we find enough small happiness to make our lives worth living. May we forgive the small lies that lead us to larger truths. Mevlut possesses a secret strangeness, but I recognize that strangeness. I read to understand people who are not like me. Yet, in recognizing the stranger, I greet myself and clasp my own hand.","Jul 17, 2018"
29033144,Guto Carioca,"I'm absolutely glad I stumbled onto this book. Not the type I'd normally pick up but being in Istanbul for a weekend motivated me to go for one of Pamuk's book.. The rich, deep and realistic tapestry he weaves of both human and urban development is bound to stay with you days and days after you put this book down.. An absolutely enthralling read, one that creeps in slowly and becomes more and more meaningful in its description of regular human beings and their (extra) ordinary lives.","Dec 17, 2018"

Pamuk subtly elaborates into chronic issues of Turkey, like political polarization, migration and urbanization.","Apr 05, 2018"
79191615,Whiskey,"Avoid tourist traps. Eat with the locals. See Istanbul through the eyes of a street vendor. “Boza seller, come on up!” Reveal Istanbul to me, from its ghettos to the shores of the Bosporus. The title and subtitle of the book summarize the story well: “A Strangeness in My Mind: Being the Adventures and Dreams of Mevlut Karatas, a Seller of Boza, and of His Friends, and also a Portrait of Life in Istanbul Between 1969 and 2012 from Many Different Points of View.”. Stretch out your hands. Grasp the palms of a street vendor and a Nobel-Prize-winning author. Let them introduce you to the identity of Istanbul, reflected in the daily lives of its denizens. Reader, your guides will escort you across 40 years and allow you to see Istanbul from the perspective of the working class as their city becomes a megalopolis, balancing modernity with its religious and cultural heritage.. Clasp Mevlut’s hand. He is a humble street vendor, who meditates as he walks and sells boza (a fermented beverage). Mevlut dreams small dreams, hoping to own his own home and to educate his daughters. He is a happy man, despite his sorrow, his disappointment, and his strangeness. Mevlut feels the familiar world in an unfamiliar way. The comprehension of Mevlut’s “strangeness” is at the heart of the novel’s mystery.. Nobody accuses Mevlut of bravery, yet he has the courage to live with goodwill toward everyone and to find a way to relate to all the factions that compose Turkey across 40 years. He feels affection for the people he meets, and he, unknowingly, charts a “Righteous Path”--a middle path between arguing factions: Islamists; modernists; criminal gangs; nationalists; leftists; capitalists; and petty in-laws. Mevlut identifies with all, but, despite his sociability, he nurtures the introvert within. He feels a disquieting strangeness that will not be silenced. Mevlut knows he is different but cannot grasp how. Why does he feel like a stranger to the city he has walked for 40 years? Why does he dream of dogs chasing him through cypress-treed cemeteries?. Take Pamuk’s hand. Pamuk is a good-natured writer who neither scolds nor moralizes. He writes for readers who will make an effort to understand and to identify with somebody who stands apart from the reader's culture and class. He requests our compassion for his characters before we make cultural or political judgments upon them. He gives us a social novel, reminiscent of 19C naturalism, which attempts to show us the lives of working-class people, trying to love their spouses and raise a family amidst military coups, the rise of Islamists, Kurdish-Turkish fights, bribery and corruption, and of course the frenzy of real estate speculation.. Pamuk chronicles his epic in simple and clear language, shorn of lyrical embellishment. Despite its complexity and large cast, I always understood what was happening. Pamuk uses a third-person limited narrator to describe Mevlut’s life; however, other characters interrupt the primary narrative by directly addressing the reader to correct the main narrator and to justify themselves in comical ways.. The plot centers on the mystery of Mevlut’s marriage to Rayiha. Mevlut was smitten with the youngest of three sisters, whom he saw at a wedding party. He then spent three years writing her love letters, only to end up eloping with the wrong sister. Even though he marries the older (and uglier) sister, he loves his wife all the more. Mevlut’s love for Rayiha defies romantic idealization and develops instead from the shared experiences of surviving with her, fighting with her, and raising children with her. Did Mevlut intend those letters for his wife, Rayiha, or his beautiful sister-in-law? Would he admit it? Was Mevlut deceived? If so, who conspired against him? Do our intentions or actions hold greater significance? Does life unfold haphazardly through random mistakes or does fate (Kismet) control our destiny? (Witness the shaky evolution of Istanbul shantytowns into gleaming skyscrapers and see if you are any closer to the answer.). We tell ourselves lies in order to live. Some lies are smaller than others. But there is a gulf between our public personas and our private personas that mimics that of the illusions of the city itself. Indeed, this same dishonesty applies to boza (the fermented beverage Mevlut sells), which is a central metaphor of the book. Boza vendors and customers must deny boza’s alcoholic content because drinking alcohol is forbidden in Islam. It is a gentle lie, told so life can be enjoyed without the sinner’s guilt. Let us visualize Mevlut selling his boza that he carries on a long pole, balanced across the back of his shoulders, like a yoke. On each side of the pole dangle chains that hold large jugs of boza. Thus, the boza vendor resembles a set of scales and helps us to visualize how we must forever balance the public and private along with the truth and fiction of our identity.. May those who suffer in love find it in the end. May we find enough small happiness to make our lives worth living. May we forgive the small lies that lead us to larger truths. Mevlut possesses a secret strangeness, but I recognize that strangeness. I read to understand people who are not like me. Yet, in recognizing the stranger, I greet myself and clasp my own hand.","Jul 17, 2018"

Janan introduces Osman to her lover Mehmet who had also read the book and been to the world it describes. Osman, who at this point is enchanted by Janan, witnesses Mehmet gunned down at a bus stop, but the injured man mysteriously disappears and can't be traced at any hospital.. The two embark on surreal bus journeys in search of Mehmet. One of the buses has a road accident which results in fatalities, however, they emerge alive, expropriating wallets and identities of two dead passengers. They continue the journey and encounter Dr. Fine, Mehmet's father.. Spoilers alert. It turns out that he had sent spies to keep watch on his rebellious son and to murder other readers of the book.

5022264,"Ian ""Marvin"" Graye","[The narrator's name is Osman. Although Mehmet is Janan's former lover, Osman regards him as a contemporary rival for her love.. Janan possibly represents the heart and soul of humanity. Thus, the rivalry is a clash of cultures seeking to win over at least the people of Turkey, if not humanity as a whole.. Having initially fallen for the ideas in the book, Mehmet rejects the apparent modernity of its vision. Still, if only to earn an income, he hand copies the novel, which perpetuates its life, and complies with the apparently Islamic acceptance of a book that has been written by hand, rather than printed by a machine.. While Mehmet's adherence to tradition seems to be less extreme than that of Dr Fine (his blood father), he still seems to represent Turkish tradition.. Dr Fine believes that his son has been killed in an earlier bus accident. He gives his ""new son"", Osman, a gun with which to kill the followers of the book.. Osman decides to use it to kill Mehmet, thus killing both tradition and his double (who has been using the name Osman), his rival in love.. In effect, Osman must kill Nature and Realism in the name of Modernity and Post-Modernity, Modernism and Post-Modernism, a New Life and a Post-Life.. At the end, Osman learns, via his own death by bus accident 13 years later, that there is no New Life on Earth. It has all been in his mind, the imaginary world created by a reader in response to the book. There might however be an After Life.. (hide spoiler). ]","Oct 25, 2012"
171197,Ben Loory,"i don't really know what to say about this one. i think i will be thinking about it for a while. i will say this: i found it both compulsively readable and boring as hell, both at the same time, all the time, beginning to end. despite all the great writers pamuk is compared to on the cover blurbs and inside (kafka, marquez, borges, proust, etc.), the writer he most reminds me of here is thomas pynchon. both come off as almost retardedly intelligent & way too clever, both are more interested in playing games and laying out a view of the world as a paranoid (in pamuk's case metaphysical) delusion/illusion than they are in writing about actual human beings and the things that happen to them, the things they feel and desire. they are also both very good writers of sentences. the thing is, i just keep thinking, what if i just ripped. this. page out? what if i just read every. other. sentence? what if. this chapter. was written in invisible ink? what if the book ended here? what if it never began? i think in general i found the book useless. i just didn't know what to make of it. emotionally. i can understand how some can get caught up in the voice, the style. it's just the feeling i don't care for, or the lack of it. it's just one note all the way through. people live, love, fight, learn, run, hide, die, laugh... all in the exact same register... all without MY feelings changing one bit. like watching a film in fast motion... only it takes a really long time... that being said, i know a guy in a foreign country who seems to have been absolutely overwhelmed by its power, so who knows... maybe the angel only comes to those who aren't expecting it...","Apr 08, 2009"

Reading the second time slowly made me realize all the symmetry, puns, even autobiographical bits and pieces of the the author himself. It evokes feelings you get when you are travelling by bus to distant places, excitement and toxic exhilaration of reading good books, and awe and scepticism of the mystery of life and love.. I would certainly read this book again.. P.S. I gave four stars before. What was I thinking?. 06/07/2008 Notes on the second reading:. I am in the mood of reading a book that blows me away. Let's see what this book take me for the second time reading..... I haven't got such an intense feeling from my readings lately.. -----------------------------. ""I read a book one day and my whole life was changed."". That sentence begins the novel. Sure enough it intrigued me to read on. The back cover said this is part road novel, part metaphysical thriller. ""Osman, a young university student, becomes obsessed with a magical book that delves into the dangerous nature of love and self. He turns his back on home and family, abandons his studies and goes on a search for the meaning of the book's darker secrets."". I was a university student, young enough, turned my back on home to search for adventure. I remember one writer said that when we read we actually search of ourselves or its elements in it. You do the math!. It is quite difficult for me to say something about the story, I guess I have to read it again. I am not sure I got the ""dark secret"" of the book. Either I don't understand (remember) it completely or Pamuk didn't really say it. I just remembered how I enjoyed the flow of this difficult novel. Much different in mode when you are reading Da Vinci Code or something like that.. I watched an interview with Pamuk in Bokbadet in a Norwegian national TV. He is an interesting figure.

When I began this book, I wanted to love Pamuk. Through his interviews and talks, the reviews of his books, and my experience with Snow, I have made some strong opinions about him, which I wanted to change in the course of reading this novel. The opinions remain unscathed, so far, but I almost liked him.. Some observations so far:. 1. Osman and Janan are too similar to Ka and Ipek: the male hero (overtly) sentimental, sensitive, vulnerable. The female hero mysterious and angelic.. 2. Young people masturbate and watch Porno. Pamuk's insistence related to the religious/moral weather in Turkey?. 3. His novel(s) is(/are) superbly planned, writing lacks precision.. Too many words (bad), too many themes (good), too many layers (awesome).. 4. Pamuk is IMPORTANT. Political reasons. He has contributed tremendously to the postmodern literature (been an avant-garde?) but his voice - where it comes form and what it says - is too crucial in our times.. The New Life was a rage in Turkey. What does that mean? Some people picked up this book and their whole life was changed.. 5. I am a bad reader. This book, that I will finish in about 3 weeks, will need at least three more weeks of re-reading (and brooding) to be able to even appreciate or denounce the work. All I am able to achieve in my first reading is reaching closer to the end.. 6. I will never be able to love Pamuk the writer.

Light surging from its pages illumines his face:. 'Its incandescence dazzled my intellect but also endowed it with brilliant lucidity.'. The book seems to be about him, so that. 'my point of view was transformed by the book, and the book was transformed by my point of view.'. Pamuk is a writer that helps me understand why I like reading; for the discovery of ideas, cultures, language, worlds, and most importantly, self. When reading his novels, the space and things around me just disappear. His plot lines are at times tenuous, something seen peripherally, weaving in and out of focus. I don't read Pamuk for the pleasure of a well-crafted story-line (though I do find the story-lines well-crafted). I read him for his style. He continually pulls me into his writing. I can't leave his books alone once started and when finished, cannot easily forget them.. 'A good book is something that reminds us of the whole world - Perhaps that’s how every book is, or what each and every book ought to be.'. In.

82944,Bob,"I burned through this in two days, but partly, I have to admit because I feared if I got distracted, I'd never finish it - highly engaging at times, it didn't, for me, always sustain that level of ""gotta get back to it"" with which Murakami's ""Kafka On The Shore"" is currently calling me away from this hurried review.. Pamuk is very highly regarded, won a Nobel Prize etc, so he is certainly worth a bit of your time.. ""The New Life"" is a story of a young man whose life is radically changed by a book whose title and content is not revealed until much later in the book (when, in one of several Borgesian tropes, it proves to be the story of his own life and be called The New Life). It starts with his quest with a young woman (who later disappears) by rattletrap buses around a Turkish landscape torn between traditional ways (more in the realm of material culture than religion) and Westernization, coming up against a mysteriously murderous father figure reminiscent of the one in Angela Carter's ""Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman"". As his ""quest"" becomes almost entirely internal and stretches into somewhat forlorn years, I was reminded of Dino Buzzati's ""The Tartar Steppe"" - then there is the secondary character whose reaction to the life-changing book is to rewrite it word for word, echoing ""Pierre Menard"", a few nods to Nabokov and so on.. Perhaps the centrality of books of any sort in shaping people's lives, or the powerful fear of their potential makes the whole thing more of a metaphor for the complex relationship of Turkey to Islam than I understood - strange and fairly memorable either way.","Jul 31, 2007"

2385526,Azarin,"After reading the opening sentence of the New Life, ""I read a book one day and my whole life was changed,"" I wondered whether reading The New Life itself was going to change my life.. This is the story of Osman, an engineering student, who becomes obsessed with a book and falls in love with a girl, Janan, who shares the same obsession. This novel is mainly the story of their journey through Turkey, going aimlessly from city to city, searching for this new life promised by the book.. At some point, as a reader, we doubt about their sanity, and we wonder what the real meaning of this mystical journey is? Is Pamuk the modern literary version of a whirling dervish looking for God or the meaning of life or one's self like Sufis? Or does this new life is all about an identity crisis, like one of the favorite themes of Pamuk?. Could it be that Osman's wandering represents Turkey and its tormented historical journey to reach a point where the never ending conflict and contradiction between the East and the West would finally reach an end?. Again, like all his other novels, the new life is not an easy read, but it is full of poetic philosophy and ambiguous dilemmas, and this was what I liked the most. Because I was tempted to put the book down every few pages, and like tasting a good wine, I had to ponder about the underlayer meaning of what I had just read.. In my case, as much as Pamuk has changed my life with each of his novels, I have to confess that I have also transformed his words because of my own particular point of view. The beauty of Pamuk's work is that whatever conclusion any reader might reach, nothing in his work is ordinary. Each of us is going to read the book through our own eyes, and changing it because of who we are, as if each reader has to rewrite this whole journey ... and this is Orhan Pamuk's strength.","Mar 06, 2010"
6672631,James K,"I am writing this short review in an airport, having just completed a three-week trip around Turkey, so bear with me as I get back into the routine of thinking about literature critically. Spookily, the parallels of. The New Life. and my trip remain powerfully disconcerting: the novel focuses on a mysterious book Osman reads one night and as a result, becomes obsessed with. The book is never described explicitly but its power to change the lives of all the people who read it works as the catalyst for this philosophical road-trip which Osman undertakes. Dissatisfied with his family, and the humdrum existence of his studies Osman suddenly leaves and journeys to the nearest. otogar. [bus-station] to begin a journey that takes him from Istanbul all the way through to the wild Anatolian steppes of Eastern Turkey, as the novel evolves through a myriad of literary structures: part detective, part existential, part thriller. Perhaps I felt more keenly attuned to this book than the average reader would, since I was a student reading a book about a student reading a book; as a student who travelled around Turkey on its myriad of roads and bus-lanes, small-villages and expressways, dingy restaurant rest stops, and flashier, Westernised otogars. I have felt the sticky sweat in my hair cool as my head leant against the window like Osman does. I have found myself in the early hours of the night staring at the poplars which look like feathers in the dark ground. I understand the rootlessness that Osman must feel having had to change travel plans myself and spend the night sleeping on a metal bench in the sprawling Ankara otogar, flies spooling around the harshly lit air, questioning the validity of everything around me. Although it is perfectly possible to travel Turkey without relying at all on its buses, you realise - just as Pamuk exemplifies - that the bus service is holy, is a way of life. However, Pamuk's public transport network is much older than the very commercial, aggressive buses I travelled on recently: for Osman each bus-ride is not only a step away from his home towards a new life but a step into the unknown landscape, of towns not on maps, and to the dangerous precipices where traffic accidents - which still to this day reign supreme in Turkey - occur. Thus, the 'New Life' is not merely life but a search for death; Osman obsesses about the idea of traffic accidents as a means of bridging together life and death, as the perfect equal point of spiritual fulfilment, of hopefully being able to explain away life's difficulties. Thankfully, my journeys were never plagued with Osman's Russian-roulette style of journeying. At the heart of. The New Life. lies the themes of identity and philosophy, through Pamuk's constant meditation on the bridging of East and West, a cultural divide which defines Turkey even to this day; here we see the greater themes of metafiction, of the great power of literature and art to exact change, and an always keenly felt embrace of faith [whether institutional or intimately personal] which in. The New Life. becomes hyperbolised in the over-dramatic proclamations of Osman - he is, at the end of the day, just as angst-ridden as any other teenager. Although Pamuk's novel can be read as a satire, and indeed its overall grandiose narrative verges dangerously on the comical, at its heart is a novel of discovery and love, between finding oneself and finding oneself somewhere else. Pamuk captures exactly the metaphysics of travelling, of a disjointedness which takes place in everyone as they board that bus - or for anyone who has ever wished to run away - or travel through the darkness towards an unknown place as I have done in this trip. Even with the novel's struggling flaws which mark the novel as far too dramatic,. The New Life. is a strongly constructed picture of Turkey in the midst of enormous economical and cultural changes, drawing over its themes the changing landscape of a country's public-transport system as its bloodline, as the heart of the novel and country.","Jul 24, 2014"
54697,Matt,"I got really into this one.. It was one of those pick-it-up-in-the-bookstore kinda things and it's funny since that's more or less what happens to the narrator.. One day he picks up a book (contents not whitholding to the reader, of course) and Kafka-like, he is never the same again.. Everything in the world around him is like a pale reflection or a crashing bore compared to what the book discloses for him. He is then, naturally, called upon to make sense of where he suddenly finds himself to search for the lost damsel of the book- only others who have had this experiece are there- and he goes through all manner of menacing and rather bleak set pieces until the final confrontation.. It's exhilerating to read something that takes you into its concept so quickly. Pamuk writes georgeously, it's like surrealism but not vague and it's like magical realism but a bit grittier.. It was a huge hit in Turkey, the author's native land, going straight to the top of the charts. It was also, of course, banned by the culture.. What loses its star is that the plot got, at least for me who is not very good with plots, clotted and congested towards the late middle. Postmodern writing is like that, I fear. the multilayered narrative style is great and all, but I prefer more clear demarcations as to how exactly I am to orient myself as I participate in the story.. Otherwise, spellbinding and subversive. Poetic and adventuresome. Great stuff.","Feb 12, 2008"

1391890,Philip,"When Osman reads the book, his life irreversibly changes. He gives up his studies to travel. He begins a search for meaning, identity and experience. He falls in love. He finds solace in the plots of popular films he watches while travelling on overnight buses across Turkey. He suffers trauma and injury in road accidents and meets people who give him useful things, such as guns. He also examines his own imagination from the inside while responding freely to the stimuli and images that experience decides to present.. Precisely which book Osman is reading is never quite revealed. Sometimes it might be any book. Perhaps it was the Koran, perhaps not. Maybe it was a murder mystery, a page tuner of the type that this particular book most certainly is not. Or perhaps Osman's book was not a single volume at all, but more of a literary tradition. Who knows? Perhaps Osman does. Perhaps not. Hence the search.. Janan might know. She has also read the book, or at least passages from it. Osman meets her on a bus and falls in love with her. Until the crash, that is, when their lives change for ever... But then, `ever' might be a long time.. The New Life by Orhan Pamuk is a novel. It is a quite novel novel. It tells Osman's story, if story it be, as he pursues the truth that the book may allow him to recognise, once he finds it. But Osman's story happens inside his head, is driven by his obsessive pursuit of the secrets of his secret book alongside the joys, both imagined and real, he finds in Janan, his new girlfriend.. Osman willingly gives up college to pursue his book. His will may be free, but we may all debate whether any human being is capable of free association. Osman certainly tries to achieve it, as he responds to East and West, to Coca Cola and yogurt, to burgers and borek. Is his experience real, or does he travel only in his head? Is his journey a life, merely a life, incompletely a life, or an imagined life?. Any reader will find The New Life a challenge. For those in search of the linear, the worked-out, even the intelligible, this book will prove impossible. It presents an impression of experience which may or may not have been experienced, impressions that might not even have been felt. There are bus crashes and casualties, but the dead may even have come back to life. There are murders, but we never really know if anyone did anything.. We are almost convinced that Osman does eventually marry, and that he has a daughter. But that is some years into a future he might even have imagined. Our daily lives are like Osman's New Life. The human experience presents experience as a cascade of half perceived, little understood but definitely registered impressions. Consciousness is not a stream, for a stream flows and has direction. Only the lucky amongst us has a life like that. Osman does not, but that is where the book and its message come in. Which book? Now there is a question.... Beauty of language, subtlety and... 1) Jumbled impressions of confused life, 2) Consequences of crisis in life culture and identity and 3) Partially digested sweets. All of these appear, and much more. And all of them are bound by a thickening sauce of Orhan Pamuk's highly digestible prose style. Do not pre-judge. Do not part judge and, perhaps, do not judge at all. Just read. It's a book. It goes where it takes you. It's life.","Feb 19, 2013"
1753018,Paula Koneazny,"I first read The New Life cerca 1997 or 1998 and fell in love with it then. I ""won"" the novel in an English Dept. Xmas party book exchange. The new prof of postcolonial lit (among other areas of expertise), Lisa Nakamura, at Sonoma State University was my ""anonymous"" gift-giver. I was prompted to reread the novel recently after a friend who read it with her book group admitted she found the writing (style)clunky and unsatisfying. (I had suggested the novel to them). One can admire Pamuk's novel through the looking-glass of postmodernism or postcolonialism or one can simply enjoy it as a surreal kind-of sort-of road novel cum romance cum Bildingsroman. Set in ""modern"" Turkey, where the existential mode of transport for young seekers is neither the railroads of the European Lost Generation nor the automobile of 50's and forward American youth, but the bus. On the Road here means On the Bus and it is on board that life, love, death, politics and philosophy play themselves out.","Mar 22, 2009"

11420292,Raisa,"I had high expectations for this book, because of ""My Name is Red"" which I read some time ago. At the time, I was fascinated with the world Pamuk revealed in My Name is Red, rendered in painstaking detail, as if sketched in with a 00 paint brush. Still, My Name is Red demanded attention, it was not a book you could casually browse through. So I was prepared to expend some effort, going into the New Life.. This book though, is entirely different in style - which in a way is a triumph. What's the point of writing something similar in style to what has already been written? But I didn't enjoy this half as much as ""My Name is Red."" It demanded the same amount of effort and attention, but not nearly the same payoff, with its breathless style and its contrived soul searching.. The premise of the book is - a book. Which, once read, changes the life of those who read it. They begin a questioning of life, love and self. But what this book really seems to take on is the clash of tradition with plastic modernity. This will appeal to the bratty college student in you who enjoys reading ""The Giants"" or maybe Rand's ""The Fountainhead"" or even the sadness in Achebe's ""Things Fall Apart."" There are flashes of genius when describing towns which become carbon copies of each other, with shiny plastic billboards and signboards for dentists.. But it was all cloaked in tiresome allegory - buses tearing along wide roads to tiny towns, outposts which were putting up a last battle against the onslaught of plastic living.. I admit another reason I didn't enjoy this book was because I related to the protagonist - whose search for meaning and struggle with melancholy and monotony was entirely self-indulgent. No one likes to be confronted with the idea that their struggles are cookie-cutter - again though there is something clever in how Pamuk refuses to equate the protagonist's struggle with something greater or more grandiose than it ultimately is.. I think maybe that was the problem. It was clever, but too much so, getting tangled up in its own allegories and metaphors and 'clues' leading up to the big reveal at the end. Which ended up feeling anticlimactic.. If you like reading about the clash of tradition and modernity, lots of allegory, self-help books (I don't know, it does have a dubious whiff of Paulo Coelho about it) and have time to spare, I'd say this is worth your time. If this description alarms and mildly nauseates you, then don't read it. Read My Name is Red instead.","Jun 11, 2017"
381149,Martine,"A year and a half ago, while making long bus journeys in Anatolia, I read Orhan Pamuk's. The New Life. , which is about a young man making long bus journeys in Anatolia. I found the Turkish bus system to be a lot safer than Pamuk describes it, but other than that, I recognised a fair bit, and loved the power of Pamuk's descriptions. I could easily see why the man was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize, although I ended up being somewhat underwhelmed by. The New Life. .. The New Life. is a road novel-cum-metaphysical thriller which tells the story of Osman, a student who reads a mysterious book that changes his life. He becomes so obsessed with the book that he sets out to find its secret, together with a girl whose life has also been significantly altered by the book. Their quest leads them on a trip through the Turkish hinterland, but most of all through some sort of metaphysical realm where things soon stop making sense, or rather make far too much sense. You be the judge.. The New Life. is not an easy book, and those who read it expecting a straightforward novel will be very frustrated. It's not really a novel, but rather a postmodern parable that sort of turns back on itself in the end. After a promising, spell-binding beginning, Pamuk loses himself in philosophical asides and metaphysical abstractions which are beautifully written (and beautifully translated) but seem to lack a plot. The increasingly obscure and surreal middle part of the book is fairly hard to get through. It contains beautiful and occasionally hypnotic descriptions of Anatolia (a part of the world which is very much torn between East and West), and paints an interesting picture of amateur detective work, obsession, the role that books can play in one's life and the particular joys of travelling with someone you love but are not in a relationship with, but the story as a whole just won't gel. The ending is intriguing again, but my main impression after finishing the book was that several chapters could have been left out without any damage to the book. It's basically a Borges story drawn out over 300 pages, and while it certainly has its merits (Pamuk is an excellent writer when he stays focused on his story), the final effect is of it being a bit... much.. And yet I look forward to rereading. The New Life. . Several people have told me the book grew on them upon rereading it, and I believe it. I can easily see this turning into a four-star book upon rereading, now that I know what the story is actually about. I also look forward to reading Pamuk's other works. I've been told that. The New Life. is his most obscure book, and that the others are actually quite brilliant. I can't wait to read them...","Mar 07, 2008"
5365750,Nazish,"While I was reading this book, I was constantly looking out for those who have read the book. The book that lures one in to disbelief about life, death and oneself was no ordinary text. I wanted to meet those people and ask them how they felt about this extraordinary piece of wonder that has uprooted a lot of people from their dense mundane lives to a treacherous deceiving adventure influenced by madness and movies.. Come, brother, come with us,. let's you and I on the bus,. go to a land that's fabulous'. I'll hum these doggerel lines found on the insides of the New Life caramel wrappers, can you possibly sum up the book in any other brighter way? The book had the tendency to tumble down a reader into that fierce depth of a well where the extent of Pamuk's literary capacities lay at rest (or possibly in a jumble). Those long jostling bus rides and those encounters with death and our humble protagonist reeks of On the Road and The Usual Suspects with the philosophical tours as our old Dostoevsky would have done.. 'I read a book one day and my whole life was changed. Even on the first page I was so affected by the book's intensity I felt my body sever itself and pull away from the chair where I sat reading the book that lay before me on the table.....'. Pamuk is the reason I still believe in the contemporay mainstream literature. And so you read this book, and you will never be the same.","Jul 10, 2013"
5997628,Thomas Hettich,"I read the book while travelling through Turkey. Although the main part of the story is set years before today, Orhan Pamuk' descriptions of the towns the protagonist visits are spot-on. The conspiracy theory of the book, which is revealed rather late and from which point much of the dramatic drive is gone - is echoed by similar thoughts of many Turks whom I met.. Overall I struggled with the book. The language stroke me as pretentious. And by not describing the contents of the text that the protagonist is reading (or rather: when it happens, I had lost interest to care), the story becomes about his journey. This journey is one of obsessions - over a book and a woman. Maybe someone trying to grasp a mystic text or experiencing unreciprocated love will find relieve reading it. But then again, the Turks did like the protagonist: ""I read a book one day and my whole life was changed"".","Aug 09, 2011"

2881911,Farhan Khalid,"I read a book one day and my whole life was changed. Minutes and pages followed one another. The wealth, the multiplicity, and the complexity of possibilities turned into a kind of terror. The book was about me. The room was no longer the same old room, nor the streets the same streets, my friends the same friends. The book revealed to me the meaning of my existence. Never fear, never fear! The world in the book is real! But I was afraid. The next day I fell in love. Trees didn’t know they were trees, I reflected. I thought not only my soul but also my body was melting away and my identity annihilated. New realms, new beings, new images appeared before me. I envisioned clouds of file, oceans of darkness, purple trees, crimson breakers. Love is such sweet torment. I read a book and found you. If this be death, then I am born again. With no memory and no past. Why buses, nights, towns?. Why all these roads, bridges, faces. Why time that has no return?. Time is three-dimensional silence, the book said. Luck is not blind, just illiterate. Luck is a palliative for those who don’t know probability and statistics. What is time? An accident!. Silence fell for a brief moment. Light was growing denser. In the mist I saw the blissful ghosts. The angel's eyes are everywhere, she said. On everything, always present. I must learn how to look, so that I may see. The angel I am looking for comes out of the book. The moment I see him, life's mystery will becomes manifested to me. You think you are reading the book, yet you are rewriting it. Most people want neither a new life nor a new world. So they kill the book's author. The faces of those who have read the book and have faith in it are distinct:. They all have the same melancholy desire in their eyes. If you comprehend the mystery, and if you are making progress toward it, life is awesome. Love points the way, empties you of the stuff of life, carries you at last to the mystery of creation. Love was the only way of apprehending a distant world. There were things I knew nothing about, things that I would never know. Now we are going to that place that is unknown to us. You look so like him but you are not like him. He is somewhere else. I now see that it is your gaze, angel. I am neither here nor their. I understand what is meant by departure. How happy I am to comprehend the meaning of peace, death and time. Keep smiling at me, angel. Happiness is being a Turk, a Turk, a Turk. What we were watching seemed to make up a kind of music of existence, or a science of life. Time is an accident, we are here in this world by accident. I had read a book, and I had lost my whole world. I had set out on the road to find a new world. It's all the conspiracy, he said. That book is merely a tool in the hands of the Great Conspiracy. Our melancholy streets, long-suffering trees, ghostly lights held out nothing to me but indifference. I put my stuff in order, pulled my time concept together, refusing to submit either to history or those who want to govern it. Why should I submit? I trust in myself. I trusted in myself and others put their trust in my willpower and the poetic justice of my life. We were bonded to each other. We communicated through ciphers. I am here and, look, I know time is slowly running out. Look how all those highways we traveled exist as themselves without being in the least aware of us once we have traveled over them. I see in your eyes how full and right is the unattainable time that reawakens between us:. Now we are neither here nor there. Not even in some sort of future that can only exist within the pages of a book. So who does the angel appear to?. Those who have faith in the book, those who read it with care. Then what?. Then you keep reading until you become transformed. Death seeped into life through the book. The world is so simple!. Nothing can be worth more than the peace that comes from oblivion. If you learn to love your life, you will know the course of action you are to take for your happiness. Life is short, this is how things are, and you know the rest. The sun disappeared behind the street in perspective, and the cool of the evening and long shadows began wandering around the streets. I was oblivious to the stillness in the book or—how shall I put it?—the internal music of the text. The good book is something that reminds us of the whole world. On one of those trips, which was refreshed in my imagination in full color like a dream of paradise each time I remembered it. I became something of a bookworm from reading so much in order to forget Janan. If books awakened in me an urge to talk, the conversation often took place between the voices in my head. What is Love?. Love is submitting. Love is the cause of love. Love is understanding. Love is a kind of music. Love and gentle heart are identical. Love is the poetry of sorrow. Love is the tender soul looking in the mirror. Love is a process of crystallization. Love is giving. Love is sharing. You can never tell about love. Love is an empty word. Love is being reunited with God. Love is bitter. Love is encountering the angel. Love is the whole world. Love is blind. Love is listening to your heart. Love is a sacred silence. What is life?. A period of time. What is time?. An accident. What is accident?. A life. A new life. I knew it was the end of my life. I absolutely had no wish for death, nor for crossing over into the new life","Oct 20, 2012"

5926056,Marko,"I think I'm done with Pamuk. Same problems as with My name is red. He can write prose that flows well, but he's completely oblivious to concepts like 'focused narrative' or 'character development'. He's excruciatingly repetitive, beating a dead horse writing about the same thing over and over without saying anything new. How many times do I need to read about people smoking cigarettes, light illuminating from a book, and statues of Ataturk? Give it a rest, dude.. There are about 3 good ideas in this book stretched and regurgitated to 300 pages of forgettable and irrelevant fiction. Anyone up for a comparison of Coca Cola to a turkish produced soda pop? How about 10 of those? Pamuk seems to think that he's saying something so profound with these mundane east-west comparisons that he needs 100s of pages to drum those ideas into our psyche. Guess what, genius, that's all perfectly known, and obvious, you didn't discover anything new.. Maybe he should try politics, so he could talk tediously all day about the dangers of foreign produced white goods and the decline of Turkish industry. In the realm of fiction, he's a seriously flawed writer. He's meandering for eternities failing to make any relevant points. His characters are laughable cardboard figures, used only as vehicles for his rudimentary political ideas. Doesn't help that he's practically a humourless writer.. Did anyone actually care whether the main character lives or dies, or finds his love or not? I can't even remember the main character's name, let alone any other of his characteristics.. Maybe I'm old fashioned but for me the essence of fiction is a connection between the writer and the reader, and on that account, Pamuk fails miserably.","Nov 12, 2013"
353993,John,"Mixed feelings. Pamuk is a gifted writer whose talent survives translation from his native Turkish. My first encounter with him was his collection of essays ""Other Colors"" which is an excellent introduction to the scope of his work and his development from a student up to his award of the Nobel Prize. The book included excerpts from his novels which I have always wanted to read. This book found its way into various bargain bins with a hardback market down to $5 in one instance and $2 a year later. I absent-mindedly bought two copies so I felt compelled to at least read one before giving the other away.. A strange and peculiar book unlike any book I have ever read. The dust jacket compares this book to Kerouac's On the Road but I don't quite agree. Kerouac wrote his magnum opus in a benzedrine-fueled burst transmitted onto a roll of strong triple ply paper. One critic dismissed it as ""typing"" rather than writing. Pamuk puts more effort into his words than JK. But at times the story thread is lost, the characters jumbled, the line between the real and imagined gets blurred a la Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The central idea -- that there is a great book out there that can radically change your life and inspire not only a change in thought but provoke reaction and repression -- is a worthy one to explore. But we are left clueless abou the content of this book, denied the kind of inspiration the protagonist experiences, ending up sifting through the wreckage of a bus crash with only fragments. Not fair! Understand his later books are better. There is a spark in this book but hopefully I will find a forest fire later in his later books like My Name is Red.","May 01, 2011"
2442580,Frank,"This book started out somewhat slowly, I thought; I was afraid I mightn't like it. Took me a while to get into it. Perhaps that was because the narrator at the beginning in rather young, and the writing is imbued with something of the impatience of youth. I guess that's a credit to Pamuk's strength as an author. But by midpoint I was hooked and glad I slogged through.. There are many typical Pamuk themes here: lost love, the cultural tensions between East and West that have marked Turkey's history since the days of the Ottomans, the search for deeper meaning. The usual subjects, in other words. Many of my favourite writers are old men. William Trevor. José Saramago. Maybe Orhan Pamuk is the youngest of the old men I read, being only a few years older than I am. And many of these favourite scribblers write the same book over and over and over again. Trevor writes the Trevor book. Pamuk writes the Pamuk book. Seeing how they rewrite it, and letting yourself be entertained and charmed and beguiled all over again is part of the enjoyment.. Another subject particularly strong in this book was the nature of ""coincidence"" in life. So it was appropriately coicidental that getting off the Staten Island ferry this afternoon after a trip to visit Mom, I walked up Whitehall, past Bowling Green and there at the foot of Broadway behind the Wall Street Bull statue, flying next to the American flag was the Turkish banner. Why? I have no idea.","Oct 13, 2009"
1457001,Stephen Durrant,"I guessed fairly early in this book that Rilke was echoing in the background: “Every angel is terrible.” Pamuk’s book is addressed to such an Angel, one who leads us to the “new life” of his title. For much of this novel, while I appreciated Pamuk’s poetic language and the sense of mystery he builds, I was slightly bored. But gradually the novel grew on me. It on one level renders homage to the power of books, as the narrator is caught in a fellowship of people who had read, been enchanted by, and ultimately entrapped by the same book—a book we later learn is but a reflection of other books (as perhaps all books are). This plays out against the background of the Turkish countryside and steppe, which are gradually and sadly disappearing into the world of Coca-Cola and other products from the West—a new and somehow more insidious crusade that erases the past. Beyond this, Pamuk’s novel is about death . . . the “new life” that comes, like life itself, as an accident. All this is heady stuff. Pamuk, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006 has produced here an extremely haunting book. Any attempt to reduce it to discrete messages such as I have weakly done above, is sure to fail. So one of many memorable lines: “Today we are altogether defeated . . . the West has swallowed us up, trampled on us in passing. They have invaded us down to our soap, our candy, our underpants; they have finished us off. But someday, perhaps a thousand years from now, we will avenge ourselves” (p. 291).","Nov 18, 2009"
236734,Frank,"“I read a book one day and my whole life was changed.” Thus begins this book about a book — Turkish author Pamuk certainly is not the first to use that idea.. The protagonist, a civil engineering student at Technical University, picks up a book because he was attracted to the pretty girl who was reading it. His rapturous description of the book’s power seems facile at first, since no details are provided. Is the book about politics, religion, philosophy, what? How can one write this much about a book without disclosing at least a tidbit of its subject or contents?. This bothered me at first, however as the protagonists new life unfolds my complaint withered away in the strong light of Pamuk’s powerful storytelling. In chapter 2 the protagonist falls in love with the girl. His intense inner voice reminds me of a bourgeois Nabokovian character, while the plot is positively Borgesian, slowly enmeshing every tiny detail into a self-referential black hole. I was riveted by chapter 3, and found chapter 4, where our hero spends his life randomly taking busses from town to unplanned town finding rapture in bus accidents, uniquely moving and comforting. I laughed out loud on several occations.. The innundation of the east by western culture and merchandise; railroads vs busses; angels on caramel wrappers; comic books and circus tents; love, jealousy and time — these themes and much more make it a rich and enjoyable reading experience.","May 28, 2011"
31281657,Supritha,"The New Life like all other Pamuk's books starts out in an intriguing manner, then loses all reason in the middle, & finally ties all the loose strings together at the end. The novel is hard to keep up with; beginning with an average youth falling in love with the 'paradise' instilled upon him by a particular book, the plot goes on to dark unchartered territory such as the beauty of road-accidents, & Turkish nationalism versus the influx of American 'plasticised' products. Since the entire narrative is based on the inaccessible world of a book, the story seems to break off midway; one is required to read through this rather dull period (I did so for I assumed Pamuk would have something up his sleeve). The author doesn't disappoint for he does neatly join-the-dots for us towards the end-chapters…unfortunately, it comes a bit too late. The novel is enjoyable if read at a stretch, for which one requires a lot of patience (especially if you are required to read Pamuk's philosophical sentences more than once in order to understand them).. Final comment- B+. A heavy novel with the singular theme of East versus West embedded into it in a complicated manner; recommended for Pamuk fans & not heavy-sleepers.","Feb 17, 2015"
590841,Cathy,"It took me forever to get all the way through this, even though it's pretty good and not terribly long. The opening, in which the narrator reads a book that obsesses him and changes his life, is compelling, but then there's a lengthy middle section in which he and the girl of his dreams ride buses around Anatolia and vaguely hope to be in a bus crash that was both tedious and had a flavor of ""hey, I've already read Ballard, thanks very much."". Things pick up a bit when he finally, finally meets the mysterious and possibly sinister Dr. Fine and starts piecing together the circumstances behind the existence of the book and why he encountered it. This entire section is beautifully written and very evocative. Then we go from Ballard to Nabokov as he goes in search of the guy who is his rival/doppelganger/sacrificial lamb and it becomes being pretty compelling again until it all ends in the only possible way that it could have, from the moment the narrator first rode the bus.. In many ways I thought it was terrific, in other ways it was tedious and frustrating, so it comes out at around three stars for me. It was the first Pamuk I'd read, and I will give Snow a try at some point.","Dec 15, 2009"
4554994,Tanuj Solanki,"The feeling that Pamuk cheats you - albeit while reading the novel you were aware of this impending cunning all the time - takes some time to forgive after you have closed the book on its inescapable ending. The book is shoddy at most times; and absolutely beautiful and sublime in a few parts. Marks have been given here for the sheer gall to have imagined such a book, where the irreal is presented, not obviously and here-it-is, like Marquez, but a bit stupefyingly, unbelievingly, in a unique voice in quest to find something more complex than existence.","Jul 30, 2011"

Although some reviewers believe that ""the book"" in this story may have reference to Beh-Rang's ""The Little Black Fish"", I did not make that connection at all.. What motivates Little Black Fish to leave his existing life in search of a path to freedom and justice is not the motivation here, in which the whole trip seems to be without any purpose.","Apr 17, 2014"

8296440,Ziggy,"A Centre of His Own. -- A tribute to Orhan Pamuk by Ziggy You:. The New Life is the very last book of all the books published in English by Orhan Pamuk I had not read. Yes I am a big fan. In my journey as a reader of literature, I had never encountered any melancholy like the kind rendered by Orhan Pamuk that is so heart-wrenching, yet at the same time so endearing. Mr Pamuk professes to challenge the notion of happiness and the idea of pursuit of happiness as the ultimate goal of human existence; 'Why not the opposite of happiness?' he asks. This question is not a novelist's pretentious self-indulgence in the woe-is-me sentimentalism; as proved by all of Orhan Pamuk's novels including The New Life, this is a valid question and an important quest.. However, Orhan Pamuk's literary trajectory is less a choice of mind than a choice of heart. He has embarked on this Odyssey in the opposite direction of happiness not because of his belief in the bold statement he made in 'Other Colours' that 'happy people are evil and stupid' (although he proclaims unequivocally that there is more to life than just being happy), but the necessity of his soul struggling at the conjunction of West and East, and his affection for his own culture which is so deep and so intense that when witnessing the diminishing of it as a result of the dominance of western culture accelerated by the force of globalisation, he cannot help but feel melancholic; to feel otherwise for a writer living in the periphery of the world at this particular era of human history is dishonest and undignifying.. Throughout his novels, the storylines vary and the subject matters differ; be it a murderer’s unrequited love, a detective’s search for the killer or a journalist’s account of the terrorist activity in a remote town of Turkey, they all serve to deal with one issue that is close to Orhan Pamuk's heart: Turkey’s national and cultural identity being increasingly threatened by the domineering influence of the West and the seemingly unstoppable forces of modernisation.. Orhan Pamuk tells us that the danger of this process is the end of autonomous history in which a country and its people cannot control their own destiny, the loss of collective memories, the values and ways of living that define Turkey as a nation, whose soul is disappearing, fast. That is why he has given the girl with whom Osman – the main character in The New Life – fell in love the name ‘Janan’ meaning ‘soul-mate’ in Turkish and then gone on to quote Fuzuli’s famous line of poetry – ‘If the soul-mate is absent there is no need for the soul.’ As a novelist whose soul is embedded in the richness of Turkish culture and Islamic civilisation as a whole, witnessing his own cultural identity being fractured and reduced to ruins piece by piece, Orhan Pamuk is right to feel melancholic; he is even right to weep a little and ask us readers to weep with him, which he has done occasionally in his novels, for what has been happening to Turkey, because ‘it appeared these ruins were not the work of time but the result of a series of disasters’.. Apart from sadness, there are also despair and anger in his melancholy. Orhan Pamuk realises that no matter how many pages he devotes to writing about Turkey’s glorious past, the splendour of its arts and history, what is gone is gone. No matter how hard he tries to remind his people of the wisdom and essence of Islamic religion and philosophy, what is lost is lost. His country’s amnesia can only get worse against Turkey’s urge to modernise, to achieve the standards of living flaunted by the West. That is why many characters in his novels including Osman in The New Life are on a quest for their beloved ones who have gone missing; they all went to extreme lengths in order to recover what they have lost or obtain what they truly love, in almost maniac manners, only to end up in tragedies. For example, Osman found out years later after he had managed to murder Janan’s lover that she had married a doctor with whom she was now living in Germany. Every now and then Orhan Pamuk turns this despair into anger against the West’s obtuse humiliation at the East, against the irony of how the world history has unfolded. For example, in The New Life, he wrote,. ‘We were the ones who had taught the West the game of chess. In the worldly arena of war, the black and white armies fought out the good and evil in our souls. And what had they done? They had made a queen out of our vizier and a bishop out of our elephant, but this was not important in itself. What was important, they had presented chess back to us as a victory of their own brand of intellect and the notions of rationalism in their world. Today we were struggling to understand our own sensitivities through their rational methods, assuming this is what becoming civilised means.’. This is where Orhan Pamuk hits home with me. The issue he is deeply concerned about his own country’s cultural identity and future is not unique to Turkey. Many nations in the world today are facing the same identity crisis, the same amnesia that torments their sensitive minds, who are not ready to let go of the things and values that make them who they are. My own country - China - is one of those countries who have been fighting a losing battle with western influence and the forces of globalisation. As a descendent of one of the world’s greatest ancient civilisations, I am immensely proud of my cultural heritage and take pride in the immeasurable contribution my ancestors have made to human civilisation as a whole. Therefore, it troubles my cultural consciousness to watch China losing the battle, it also angers me to see many of my countrymen are so ready to give up without a good fight and what’s worse, it saddens me to realise that many more are not even aware of what has been happening to us. Orhan Pamuk speaks for me; his melancholy resonates with my sorrow, his anger strikes a chord with mine. By waking up the lost memories of Turkey, he also speaks for the millions in the periphery whose voices have long been ignored and unheard by those living in the centre of the world, as Tom Holland declares that ‘We in the West can only feel grateful that such a novelist as Pamuk exists, to act as a bridge between our culture and that of a heritage quite as rich as our own.’ Indeed! And we in the East owe Orhan Pamuk a thank-you as well!. It may sound ominous to say that I kept forgetting the fact that Orhan Pamuk is a living author. The reason for this illusion is that Pamuk’s novels are always so masterfully crafted that they keep bringing back memories of my reading works by those great writers of 19th and 20th century, literary giants such as Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Flaubert, Proust, Nabokov, Virginal Woolf and Faulkner and so on. He was a talented apprentice of these masters, following their footsteps, faithfully, and has become a master of his own after having acquired all the superlative techniques of fiction writing. He understands how to utilise words to create memorable scenes like Dostoyevsky did while he also knows how to conjure up stunning imageries like Proust did. He is as meticulous with diction as Nabokov was and as imaginative with his visions as Virginia Woolf. He has taken Flaubert’s lesson on ‘style’ by heart knowing that if a story fails it usually fails because of its style not because the story is trivial. As a writer from the periphery, living outside the centre of world literature which he considers to be western literature, he admits to have been influenced by Faulkner whose novels have given voices to those in remote corners of the world whose lives are every bit as real and valuable as those living in the centre.. Orhan Pamuk is grateful for these western writers that have come before him and forever indebted to western literature as he deems in The New Life ‘the best invention of the West’. He was once fearful as well; he was worried about being left outside, lacking authenticity as he confessed in his Nobel Prize Winner’s lecture – My Father’s Suitcase. However, through writing Orhan Pamuk has found confidence in the belief that ‘all human beings resemble each other, that others carry wounds like mine – that they will therefore understand. All true literature rises from this childish, hopeful certainty that all people resemble each other’. Out of this confidence, out of his anger at the world and love for his own culture, he felt the need to take up the novelist’s pen; he wanted ‘all of us, the whole world, to know what sort of life we lived, and continue to live, in Istanbul, in Turkey’. So he has done, successfully, and above all, he has created his own centre.. As I was reaching the end of The New Life, unexpectedly, torrents of tears started streaming down my cheeks. Blurry eyed, I had to put the book down to wipe my tears away, to regulate my mixed emotions evoked by the beauty of Orhan Pamuk's writing and the sorrow of the story that was nearing its imminent end. I was nervous too, fearing that the ending might disappoint. No. He has never disappointed me and I don’t believe he ever will, perhaps because he never manages to be happy and he writes to be happy. Yet, because of his irremediable unhappiness, Orhan Pamuk has made me a very happy reader.","Feb 21, 2013"
880021,David Sasaki,"When Orhan Pamuk published. The New Life. in 1995 it. became the fastest-selling book in Turkish history. . (1995 was the same year that. Pamuk was tried. along with several other authors for his support of Kurdish political rights in Turkey.) The book reads like a cross of Franz Kafka with Paulo Coelho. The Coelho half (fate, destiny, love, a cyclical plot) explains the book's mass appeal; the influence of Kafka points to Pamuk's desire to become part of the post-modern canon (something he writes and. lectures. about frequently).. This is. a book about books. , and about the transformational power a single book can hold - especially on the youth:. I had heard of others who had read a book only to have their lives disintegrate. I'd read the account of someone who had read a book called. Fundamental Principles of Philosophy. ; in total agreement with the book, which he read in one night, he joined the Revolutionary Proletarian Advance Guard the very next day, only to be nabbed three days later robbing a bank and end up doing time for the next ten years. I also knew about those who had stayed awake the whole night reading books such as. Islam and the New Ethos. or. The Betrayal of Westernization. , then immediately abandoned the tavern for the mosque, sat themselves on those ice-cold rugs doused with rosewater, and began preparing patiently for the next life which was not due for another fifty years. I had even met some who got carried away by books with titles like. Love Sets You Free. or. Know Yourself. , and although these people were the sort who were capable of believing in astrology, they too could say in all sincerity, ""This book changed my life over-night!"". All lovers of great fiction have experienced this feeling, right? I've had it many times; that after reading some novel an element of life that previously was blurry or entirely unseen comes into crisp focus. But it tends to happen in such a way that the realization itself is impossible to aphorize. You simply have to read the book.. Which is why we do. In fact, I'm convinced that those minor glimpses of personal enlightenment - and the satisfaction they give - are a major part of why I continue to read, even if I tend to forget the books themselves a few years down the road. Those books - the kind that really change your life, the ones you recommend to everyone and then grow despondent when they merely shrug their shoulders after coming to the last page - can do both harm and good. They could bring you closer to your family, relieve you of stress, convince you to live a healthier life. But just as easily, such an influential book could make you paranoid, drive you away from you friends, convince you to kill the president of your country, or the world's most famous rock star. (Two infamous assassins,. Mark Chapman. - John Lennon's assassin - and. John Hinckley Jr.. - President Regan's attempted assassin - were both found with copies of J.D. Salinger's. The Catcher in the Rye. .). The New Life. is mostly about the second kind of effect books can have, the kind that destroys lives and relationships. Still, Pamuk manages to insert. all of his usual themes. : East Vs. West, the nostalgia of local material goods, the paranoia of conservative Islam, the Turkish empire in its final and complete decline, the ever-present irrational variable that is love and lust:. When I press my lips on that semitransparent skin between your ear and your hair, when the electricity of your hair gives fright to the birds that suddenly swoop past my forehead and face, raising the scent of autumn in the air, and when your breast stiffens like a stubborn bird taking wing in my palm, look, I see in your eyes how full and right is the unattainable time that reawakens between us: now we are neither here nor there, not in the land you have been dreaming about, not on some bus or in a dim hotel room somewhere, not even in some sort of future that can only exist within the pages of a book.. Despite the occasional piercing paragraph like the one above, this book, for me, failed to deliver. It is too much shoe polish, not enough substance. It's the girl with the heavy eye shadow who speaks in half-allusions and riddles to hide the fact that she really has nothing to say. I'm sure that if I re-read the book from start to finish I would discover that some of those riddles and oft-repeated abstractions actually point back to clues sprinkled throughout the book's first half. But I don't read novels for the thrill of a crossword puzzle. I seek beautiful ideas expressed beautifully by characters I come to care for, or even loathe. In. The New Life. there was none of this, and much of the writing (or at least its translation) was awkward and clumsy, something the narrator even apologizes for:. So, Reader, place your faith neither in a character like me, who is not all that sensitive, nor in my anguish and the violence of the story I have to tell; but believe that the world is a cruel place. Besides, this newfangled plaything called the novel, which is the greatest invention of Western culture, is none of our culture's business. That the reader hears the clumsiness of my voice within these pages is not because I am speaking raucously from a plane which has been polluted by books and vulgarized by gross thoughts; it results rather from the fact that I still have not quite figured out how to inhabit this foreign toy.. Many of the novel's abstractions intend - I believe - to encourage the reader to think about how we each interpret and appropriate the books we read, as I am doing now. Appropriation, a. recent topic of conversation. around these parts, is something that Pamuk seems to obsess about. Jillian, having attended one of Pamuk's Norton Lectures,. criticized. the professor who introduced Pamuk for referring to ""world literature"" as an ""emerging field,"" of which Pamuk is an undeniable force. I think that Jillian is right to point out the parochialism of ignoring millennia of storytelling from all human groups since the evolution of language,. or even before. . (""Did language develop first and storytellers evolve from the use of it? Or did language evolve as a way to express the internal experiences of storytellers?"" asks Becky Hahn.). But it is worth pointing out that Pamuk himself,. in an interview with Christopher Lydon. , says that the modern novel is a European invention, and, further, the most universal medium of storytelling. (Many radio, TV, and even video game producers would surely beg to disagree.) Pamuk says that the challenge for novelists living outside of the West is to appropriate the form of the novel for themselves while still building upon the work of its European masters, and not just reacting to them. I think it remains to be seen:. will literature ever truly transcend nationality?. Is the novel so rooted in European culture that only a new form of storytelling can escape that continent's longstanding literary hegemony? Or, for that matter, will the novel as a medium and format, continue to exist at all?","Mar 10, 2010"
27482323,Omar Taufik,"This was the 5th novel ( 7th book ) I read written by the author Orhan Pamuk.. With it's depth it reminded me of the previous novel The Black Book along with other similar aspects in common. I cannot claim I managed to grasp everything in this deep book since there are many areas in the book that are somehow intangible to touch but can be felt by the reader touching really deep inside which is one the wonderful things about this book.. Again the author uses his amazing descriptive talent and power to pull the reader into the novel immersed in it's wondrous world.. The reader will enjoy an interesting trip starting from Istanbul going all around the vast Anatolian inland with Osman and his quest for love, identity and the new life. His feelings of love and memories being sweet and bitter are very touching to the reader with it's melancholy.. The usual culture struggle between east and west / traditional and modern is clearly present through the novel along with an amazing psychological and philosophical exploration of meanings of life and death of love and happiness and many other aspects of life.. I would like to share with you below quotes I took while reading the novel :. I read a book one day and my whole life was changed. The New Life, p 3. I read on, turning the pages now as if I were reading a guidebook which would lead me through a strange and savage land. Help me, I felt like saying, help me find the new life, safe and unscathed by any mishap. Yet I knew the new life was built on words in the guidebook. I read it word for word, trying to find my path, but at the same time I was also imagining, to my own amazement, wonders upon wonders which would surely lead me astray. The New Life, p 4. The more I turned the pages, the more a world that I could have never imagined, or perceived, pervaded my being and took hold of my soul.. The New Life, p 5. I began to understand that everything the book had initially whispered to me, then pounded into me, and eventually forced on me relentlessly had always been present, there, lying deep in my soul. The book had found the lost treasury that had been lying below the surface for ages and ages and brought it up, and I felt I could appropriate for myself what I read in between the lines and the words. The New Life, p 6. Being cut off from my former life must have felt so horrifying for the moment that I too, like other people whose lives have been irretrievably altered by some disaster, wanted to comfort myself by assuming my life would resume it's former course, that it was not something terrible that had befallen me, some accident or catastrophe. But the presence of the book standing open behind me was so palpable to my senses that I could not even imagine how my life could ever return to it's old track.. The New Life, p 8. That was how I almost came to believe I had total possession of my future, but I also knew what possessed me at present was the book. Not only had the book permeated my being like a secret or a sin, it had dragged me into the kind of speechlessness one experiences in dreams.. The New Life, p 10. I was all too painfully aware that this world was contingent on a string of misinterpreted signals and an ingrained miscellany of indiscriminate habits, and that real life was located somewhere either outside or inside, yet definatly somewhere within those parameters.. The New Life, p 32. Ah, you who ride the night buses ! My abject brethren! I know you too are seeking the hour of zero gravity. Ah, to be neither here nor there! To become someone else and roam the peaceful garden that exists between the two worlds!. The New Life, p 54. What is time ? An accident! What is life? Time! What is accident? A life, a new life!. The New Life, p 56. I used to be someone else once, and that someone used to desire to become me.. The New Life, p 57. Many times one does exactly the opposite of what one thinks, or thinks one is doing.. The New Life, p 68. Love points the way, empties you of the stuff of life, carries you at last to the mystery of creation.. The New Life, p 71-72. True : accidents are departures, and departures are accidents. The angel becomes visible at the magical moment of departure, and it is then that we perceive the real meaning of the turmoil called life. Only then can we ever go back home.. The New Life, p 75. Still, life is beautiful if you are on the road to somewhere.. The New Life, p 77. This was life in it's essence ; it was neither one thing nor the other, neither in heaven nor in hell. It was right here, in the present, in the moment, life in all it's glory.. The New Life, p 101. Why is it that one thinks through words, but suffers through images? "" I want! I want! ""I said to myself without quite knowing what it was that I wanted.. The New Life, p 104-105. Miserable losers that we were, it was obvious that we had lost the gamble called history; now we were reduced to bombing each other for centuries to come, hoping to convince ourselves that we are winners and get a taste of victory, blowing up our souls and our bodies to high heaven with bombs we place in gear housings, in volumes of the Koran, and in boxes of candy made for the love of God, books, history, and the world.. The New Life, p 107. When you come to think of it, injustice and wickedness exist everywhere in the world.. The New Life, p 117. What is important is to live in such a way that the goodness inside you is kept intact.. The New Life, p 117. Others observe nature only to see there their own limitations, their own inadequacies, their own fears. Then, fearful of their own frailties, they ascribe their fear to nature's boundlessness, it's grandness. As for me, I observe in nature a powerful statement which speaks to me, reminding me of my own willpower that I must sustain; I see there a rich manuscript which I read resolutely, mercilessly, fearlessly. Similar to great eras and great states, great men too are those who can accumulate in themselves power so great that it is at the point of exploding. When the time is ripe, when opportunities present themselves, when history gets rewritten, this great power moves as pitilessly and decisively as the great man who has been mobilized. Then fate is also set mercilessly into motion.. The New Life, p 137. Nothing can be worth more than the peace that comes from oblivion.. The New Life, p 204.. Your hour of happiness will also strike, do not become impatient, do not be cross with your life, cease and desist envying others! If you learn to love your life, you will know the course of action you are to take for your happiness.. The New Life , p 207. A good book is something that reminds us of the whole world.. The New Life , p 222. A good book is a piece of writing that implies things that don't exist, a kind of absence, or death... But it is futile to look outside the book for a realm that is located beyond the words.. The New Life , p 222. How magical it is to see the world not through the keyholes we call our eyes but for an instant through the logic of another sort of lens.. The New Life , p 255. In the life of those people like me whose lives have slipped off the track, sorrow presents itself in the form of rage that wants to pass itself off as cleverness. And it's the desire to be clever that finally spoils everything.. The New Life, p 285. So that was life; there was accident, there was luck, there was love, there was loneliness; there was not; there was sorrow; there was light, death, also happiness that was dimly there; it was necessary one didn't disregard all that.. The New Life, p 286. What is life ? A period of time. What is time ? An accident. What is accident? A life. A new life.. The New Life, p 294. Again as in his previous novels, I would like to thank our great author Orhan Pamuk for his great and insightful works looking forward to reading the rest of his novels and works hopefully in the near future.","Feb 08, 2014"
25242710,Basheer Kuzhikkandathil,"Hallo everyone.. I will try to give my subjective perception about the Book 'The New Life' that I have read finished today by Orhan Pmuk. At the outset, I want to express my deep happiness because the flashes of inspiration the book offered to me have made life enhancing effects. It occurred to me through two week and I could keep pace though I am a slow reader. The book by Orhan Pamuk is pretty much amusing and amazing too. Some time I felt as if I places some sweets on my tongue imaging it should not have an end in soon. The book deals with a lot of different subject matters and most of them either sense of identity or loss of identity even seeking of identity and most probably having multiple identity in which one is trying to get in to live in the world. And also lot of emphasizes on relationships be then romantics of eternal and even symbolic. They all have certain rule and that Orhan Pamuk not. Orhan Pamuk doesn't necessarily romanticize any concept. He just focus the flows and possibility of characters to ever expanding horizons of fantasizes and mixes of metaphysics and horror.. 'The New Life' is biographical and first person narratives like in most other books of Pmuk; Snow, Istanbul etc. There is high possibility that every reader will keep on until the book to finish if the first line of the book ""One day I read a book that my whole life changes"" stoke so much on him/her. Like me, everyone read with the intention that for changes in life that a book can make. I think this is the tricks that Pamuk adopted in his book to capture as many reader as possible. The very tittle of the book also delineate this facts.. Osman, twenty two aged young university engineering student obsessed with the books. He dare to leave everything apart for acquiring the surges of light for the life in future because of effects of book. He find falling in love with a girl in very next day helps to reach the goal of life in the book. He enjoyed spending and talking to anyone who have read that book. The adventurous journey and fife after that flows in the remaining chapters is arranged is not in perfect compatible in a manner that it could make any significant impact on anyone life is the only issue with the books in fact striking limitation that found in the work.. Basically the book is about Osman, a young civil engineering student from technical university located in Istanbul. He one day find a book that really changes his life because as soon as he started reading the book, he want to be the part of the book and he want to be the part of the world that is inside the book. There is obvious explanation by Orhan Pamuk that there is a chance that this world is not entirely real or that it could be, it is not a parallel universe. It is not something fictional but it could not be real. There is essential that you could drown so much into the book that you want live a life of the book, despite of the fact that their connotations and invitation that life does not real and it cannot be characterize and transform into something concrete.. Now, one of the best aspect of the plot devices of the book is that you never comes to know what is inside the book, that is one of the mistake, like if you read, Pamuk really not tell you what the book really completely. He never tells you exact what the book really is about. It just something you know that transformed the persons life and most peoples life when they read it. But you know it is not. It does not feels that he is missing something out, because he is not talking about the book. He is actually know that he is talking, so enlightening in a way, and so transformative. But you don not really feel there is a absence of connection because there is no book to talk about like there is a book but there is no description of the book or detailing of the book. This technique does not make an absence of plot or absence of character development, in fact character development and character introspection is extremely vitalant his book and very well fleshed up. You get into see how Osman get into form ordinary normal life into a intense form of life. When he runs away from his home and decide to pursue the life in the book.. Now, there are character that read the book and share Osman with his journey either intermittently or throughout. One of them is Janan, who Osman really love and want to be with in every possible ways. But Janan is in love with other main character of the novel, who is Mehmet. Mehmet is Jana's boyfriend in a way, he is also read the book, in fact he introduced Janan to this book as well. So basically, he is the one in their triangle who is the most aware of the book. And basically he is also the one character that Osman tries to rival with not only for Janan's affection as you realize, but also for the realization and enlightenment to get meaning from the book.. Now, Mehmet, is like, they all have a sort of spiritual crises which seems to have resolved that book either heightened from the book. When you read this novel, you will able to identify which characters have been really transformed by the book and what matter of degree that they have been transformed.. I really like the book the way that Pamuk that you have very nice protagonist Osman and you have also very good protagonist in Mehmet and Jenan. You also have other characters you can relate with the things like that. Basically the book all about I think a young adults crises as well. When you reach a point in the life, you feel like what you want to do, what we want to achieve, that part of life is very crucial, and very subjective influence have both positive and negative influence and it could definitely a hazardst test not everybody aware of with.. Osman is the both the symbol of both hazardness and promises to youth. He is also somebody gaining maturity as the book away. You can understand and lot of questions you can ask when Osman is making choices is going forward because you want to understand may be slightly older reader they might connect with Osman. They all might attend questions, motivations, and what is first about. But at the same time you cannot deject Osman. It is really hard to deject because he is a character that may of as will be able to connect with may be will not go to the extreme that he goes to. But he can understand how feels like to be inspired by the certain things and to want to get them and have a romantic notion that and the things that they can be true.. There is also this talks that Many Mehmet has lived the life of the books. This is what Janan says early on and resort to the question has Mehmet really lived the life of the book and if have this why he still have this quest to revisit that life still get that life that he gotten from the book. Overall this book is very psychological in depth analyses of young adult Mehmet character and spiritual progression, spiritual decline and the condition of growing up of general. Accepting things as they as also getting enlightening philosophy that how helped and also understood which philosophy works in real life and which are not.. I stop by noting the most striking line from 'The New Life'. ""If you learn to love your life you will know the course of action you are to take for your happiness""","Nov 09, 2014"
48074717,Michal Mironov,"One of the strangest books I've ever read. I struggled with author's dreamy storytelling and how carelessly he crossed the boundaries between reality and fiction until it hopelessly merged. More than often I found my mind drifting away from the story, so I had to focus hard to get my attention back to the text. Chewing through some chapters required almost heroic effort.. Although the book is quite thin, the author used words and details like there was no tomorrow, showing no fear that the impatient reader might simply throw the book away anytime. This disrespect and self-confidence both irritated and impressed me.. The New Life. is about the power of books and troubles people experience with their interpretation. How greatly books can inspire someone, but also how badly hurt the others. It’s also about troubles with finding identity in a modern world where cultural differences and traditions quickly melt away. Pamuk also refers to current problems with fanatics and extremists: ""Look for (naïve) people like me, introduce them to some book, and then destroy their lives"" - the main character blames others for his own crimes.. Pamuk reminds me of an oriental, more mystical and melancholic version of Umberto Eco. They both highlight the importance of books, but mocks egos of writers and readers at the same time. It was until the very end, when – to my own surprise – I started to enjoy this unconventional writing style and special atmosphere the book emanates. Unfortunately, it was way too late to get rid of the bad aftertaste. I can fully understand why someone is excited about this book, but also why another cannot finish it. Speaking for myself,. The New Life. is definitely not my cup of tea, but I will remember it for a long time.","May 23, 2019"

22990491,Justin Labelle,"It is extremely hard to start reading a book with checked expectations when, on the front jacket, comparisons are being made to Kafka, Borges and Marquez.. Pamuk disappoints.. Perhaps it is the translation. Perhaps not.. Pamuk wants to whisk us away to an Istanbul, to a Turkey, undergoing massive economic social interruption and change. He wants his reader to feel the pressures of the West on the East. He wants us to lose heart at the quantity and abundance of machine made objects, at the lose of a communal soul. Only he doesn't.. The characters are underdeveloped and unlikeable.. There are few sincere psychological insights and, when present, thin.. The plot is uninteresting given the possibilities.. One constantly feels like more could have been done with the material and it suffers from an unoriginal, foreshadowed ending.. For what it's worth, it was my biggest disappointment of the year.","Nov 02, 2018"
3126875,Erica Verrillo,"The first sentence of The New Life is: ""I read a book one day and my whole life was changed."" As the main character reads, he is infused with light, and literally knocked off the path of his life. From that point on, dear Reader, abandon your preconceptions of what you think a novel should be, for The New Life won't conform to them.. The New Life can best be described as a prolonged, complex and highly poetic metaphor. If you try to take the endless journeys, the long rambling philosophical asides, indeed, the characters themselves, at face value you will find yourself frustrated by the obscurities, the meanderings, and the lack of tidy resolutions which Pamuk manages to dish out in heaping portions from the first to the last page.. In one sense this book is a typical ""road story"" taking us on an interminable bus ride with the protagonist as he searches for the meaning of life, love, and peace (and ultimately death). Osman, our romantic hero, is beset both by the book he reads and by love in equal portions. In fact, the two become so intertwined that it is almost impossible for the reader (or the author) to make a clear distinction between the transformation precipitated by the book, and the similar transformation produced by the honey-haired beauty who leads him on his long journey into ... what?. This is where most readers will be tempted to toss up their hands. What is our hero seeking? What is this New Life which ruins his placid existence? Why does he seek it with such fervor? Why does it lead to conspiracies, counter-conspiracies, assassination? Pamuk doesn't clarify these central questions for us. Instead he heaps on multiple confusions--the main character and his nemesis have the same name, the same ""father"", the same girlfriend, the same body type, making the reader doubt the reality of either of these characters. The obsessiveness of Osman and the increasing absurdity of the interactions he has with just about everybody throw a constant curve on the plot, and on our willingness to cooperate with it.. So, with all this confusion, obscurity, and outright ridiculousness, (not to mention dizzying shifts of address) how does The New Life manage to work as a novel?. The answer is that it doesn't. The New Life is a parable. Our hero is Turkey itself, caught between the absurdity/tragedy of his/its own past (caramels and kerosene lanterns) and the absurdity/tragedy of his/its present (Coke and hamburgers). The tug-of-war between East and West which characterizes Turkey infuses this entire book. By the end, we are filled with Turkey's restless, unrequited, and unfulfilling love for that which was, and for the ""progress"" which can never be--Osman's seesaw between self-destructiveness and Nirvana.. Orhan Pamuk is perhaps the most original writer to have emerged in the past two decades. As an author, and as a philosopher, he is not afraid to take risks. That quality makes this book a ""heavy read"", but if you can manage to stick with it, it will infuse you with light, because as Pamuk says ""A good book is something that reminds us of the whole world."" Like all good parables, The New Life reminds us of ourselves.","Oct 20, 2012"
962322,Dennis,"I'm afraid that a lot of this book felt like a rehash of old themes for me. The first is the idea of the found book which changes the course of one's life, causing you to abandon your old life for a new one. Next we have the hidden sect of those who ""know"" and the countersect of those trying to contain this secret knowledge and the threat it presents. Following this is the idea of trying to track down the author, who usually turns out to be dead. After this is the discovery that the book turns out not to be original thought but a mishmash of old thought rewritten. Finally, all of this is bound to end badly for at least some of the characters. There is a lot that is different in this; Pamuk didn't win the Nobel for being unoriginal in his writing and much of this is full of his philosophical interpretations of evidence presented against the history of Turkey - in this case, as Turkey modernized and became more European and less Asian/Islamic in its daily cultural life, globalization taking hold - but the theme of following a secret book lost me early on. I think this was because I had enough of this in my hippy-dippy days of university when a lot of my fellow students found a profundity in some books that seemed more drug-induced than anything. Drugs have NOTHING to do with this book, no hashish dens in Istanbul, but I had enough in the past of those who ""got it"" after reading regurgitated mysticism and their sneering dismissal of those of us remained unenlightened to get into this book. A lot to recommend it but count me as ""out.""","Jan 10, 2017"
8263423,Pulkit Singhal,"One of those books which have rich narrative replete with hidden and deep meanings and with vivid imagery being created from time to time by the author. Thus needless to affirm that I loved reading it. I could actually imagine myself riding those long bus journeys through vast steppes in search of something pure and meaningful. What I adored the most was the presence of this elusive mysteriousness constantly accompanying the reader. And yes, I liked the character of Janan which I think has been sketched quite beautifully. Reading about her gives one a feeling that this is one girl that any guy can fall head over heels in love with. Also one inference that anyone who has read the book can make is that that by the end of it, you realize you *got to* give it a second read because you know it somewhere within heart that the awesomeness shall be multiplied manifolds the next time as you shall be able to connect each line, description, detail with something that is going to happen in the ensuing chapters that you already know having read them before. I myself am so psyched just on the thought of reading the book again, witnessing tons of new meanings and mysteries getting unfolded.. Overall, a delightful read which should be exploited by anyone who likes dreamy and mystical content in books.","Sep 06, 2012"
2301925,Tatiana,"still hesitating : do I like it or not?. well, now that I've finished it, I think the end is very enthralling, the revelation is wise and yet consistent enough with all the paraphernalia that had been set on the way of the protagonist, fuelling his quest for truth, in the end for death. However, I found the heart of the novel lingering in the endless bus switching which turned out to be repetitive. I thought,the message is obvious once the first two or three trips are described, why should we bother reading another hundred pages ? My overall conclusion is that it is a little too infested with postmodern , self-conscious quotes, which an average character cannot plausibly say, state or think, not being at the novelist's place.Is there a contamination of the novelist's mind, I wonder? if so, it makes the exploration of the protagonist too mental, intellectual. To be compared to Marquez's One hundred years of solitude,is relevant in Pamuk's case, however he does not ,in my humble opinion, manage to convey such a magnificent universe and his thought though of enviable scope (how do the east and the West mutually influenceeach other, how should Turkey reverse the westernization of its society?), is not rested upon an eventful, skilfully crafted plot.","May 12, 2010"
926712,MJ,"The New Life Osman and Janan seem to be the same characters as Ka and Ipek from Pamuk’s other novel Snow, and as with Snow, the reader is sent meandering through mesmerizing prose on a quest to understand present day Turkey.. Some of my favorite quotes:. “Miserable losers that we were it was obvious that we had the lost the gamble called history; now we were reduced to bombing each other for centuries to come, hoping to convince ourselves that we are winners and get a taste of victory, blowing up our souls and our bodies to high heaven with bombs we place in gear housing, in volumes of the Koran, and in boxes of candy made for the love of God, books, history and the world.”. “Our timepieces are our vehicles to reach God, not the means of rushing to keep up with the world as they are in the West. There never was a nation on earth as devoted to timepieces as we have been; we were the greatest patrons of European clock makers. Timepieces are the only product of theirs that has been acceptable to our souls. That is why clocks are th only things other than guns that cannot be classified as foreign or domestic. For us there are two venues that lead to God. Armaments are the vehicles of Jihad; timepieces are the vehicles for prayer.”","Apr 21, 2013"
5887151,Persephone Abbott,"Many stories there are not, and an author must pick one to describe. Pamuk picks the most obvious: guy needs to win girl. What guy and which girl? Who are we, within and outside our cultures? Where are the borders of reality and submission? Is rebellion against cultural erosion the winning team? Is the search for purity realistic? It is in the seeming surreal world that Pamuk uses to describe the chase after death and the obsession of purity. Or is it? Is the world of badly maintained buses, rancid cafes serving local or national products and videos played of poor Hollywood movies surreal or is it reality? At the end, Pamuk wades through the definitions of commercialized love in a brilliant summation of word not meeting deed. By using a book within the book, a story-object, as the momentum of the story Pamuk explores the facets in which words in a book (“Changed my whole life”) describe life more vividly than life itself. The excitement ends after the return of the hero to his mother. Soon after he joins the inevitability of middle aged life, the slow descent into habit, the historical scenes of youth willing him to stay secretly alive in hope awaiting the coming angel of reincarnation, the momentum churning within a book and held in every human being.","Sep 03, 2015"
17122384,Pavel,"The label of postmodern author evokes in me suspicion: disorientation, loss of identity, boundless pluralism of meaning. All of this can be found in the “New Life” and yet I do not regret the hours I have spent with it.. The novel deals with mysterious book in light of which young student Osman finds a new meaning... But meaning of what? Of his life, of the whole world or just of the book itself? So the question of the meaning of text transforms into the question how the meaning of text “is”. And of course, it is also novel about love, love of Osman to another reader of the book, Canan. Not less complicated: Was the book occasion for Osman to meet the girl, or was the girl occasion to meet the book? Anyway, we travel with them across Turkey, see how the world changes, people loose illusions, find peace or rise in desperate resistance. It is bizarre picture inhabited with crazy figures dominated by paranoid ideas of conspiracy and anti-conspiracy, really a postmodern jumble made up of exotic Turkish ingredients, but I enjoyed the search of meaning in this mess. At least I must admit some deep and disturbing meaning could be found there.","Jun 30, 2013"
48807617,Athul Domichen,"I had no plans to read this book but then since I hand no other book at hand then, Priscilla chose this one for me from her bookshelf. I am so glad that she did. 'The New Life' tells the story of a young man whose life got transformed completely by a book he read. It kind of does the same to you too. 'The New Life' is slow placed and written in a 'stream of consciousness' manner. The things that are said really gets to you and you get immersed in the book pretty soon, loosing yourselves in it and wondering so often about reality. The endless bus journeys taken up by the protagonist after being under the influence of the book, the crashes, the deaths, the sights, all affects entices and disturbs the reader too. While and after reading the book I had a strong urge to travel long and far to unknown destinations, just like how the protagonist Osman did- bus stations to bus stations, places to places, without caring about ordinary life - could be impossible for a person like me, but I wish. 'The New Life', I think, gave me a new immersive life in those couple days of reading, took me in like no book ever did till then.","Dec 22, 2015"
10305642,Liam89,"A strange and at times outright rambling dissection of the tensions between the cosmopolitan and European Turkey of the West, and the traditional and religious East. We are in the company of Osman, a university student who life is one day transformed when he reads a book given to him by a woman he has fallen madly in love with. He decides he must abandon his studies and go in search of the true meaning of the novel, taking a series of bus rides across Turkey to bring him close to the epiphany he so craves. While there are some exciting moments and a clever sense of irony (Osman encounters the supposedly reactionary religious East, even though he is the one who thinks his life is complete with just one book) at times the book rambles on to such an extent that you wonder how many different ways Pamuk can find to tell us that the protagonist is having another ""moment"". Fun enough, but too often slightly tedious, with obvious allusions to Kafka, one wishes Pamuk had Kafka's same allegiance to brevity.","May 04, 2014"

The enduring image of mehmet-nahit-osman , a young man starting life afresh at will embracing fresh identities and eventually of his killer Osman. The protagonist how loses control of his life after reading the book, all woven in the imitable fabric that Pamuk is capable of.

18926461,Aditya Venkataraman,"3.5/5. Hard to read. Dense, multi-layered, and deeply Turkish. Requires discipline to get past the first 100 pages, which had very little story to hold on to. The next 200 pages were much better - the crispness of Dr. Fine's character was like a breath of fresh air amidst the unbearable nebulousness of the central character, Osman and the graveness of his lover, Janan. There is a blunt humor in this book that will make you laugh out loud at times, such as the spies named after western watch brands; bits of delicious metafiction that blend nicely with the overarching melancholy of this work. You will, most likely, finish this book feeling shortchanged. This book is like a ride on one of those newly modern buses that it constantly talks about - brief stretches of comfort cushioned by plenty of jolts and creaks, making you think you're getting somewhere but there is nothing beyond the interminable asphalt.","Sep 16, 2017"

The narrator of this somewhat obscure and puzzling work, leaves his life behind and becomes suspended in the space between life and death while he searches for the promise of the New Life. This is a book about obsession, unrequited love, with an air of melancholy throughout. On the way we encounter aimless bus travel and multiple crashes in Turkey, seedy nocturnal cafes, insomniacs, a discussion about angels, a murder, and a group of private detectives whimsically named after brands of watches.. What is it about? I thought it was a metaphor for religion, other reviewers much cleverer than I have said it is a metaphor for modern Turkey..

Is quite astonishing.. There is no big reveal, no explosive finish, it’s a slow burn but a beautiful one. I intend to read it again, in six months time or so, I think it’s a book that will improve a great deal on a repeat run.. The writing is poetic, romantic, colourful, delicious.

And after all those loses that this book gave me, I loved the book doubly so for it..

It was as if during the last 3 months I was cured of a mental block that kept me from enjoying his style, as if I had read two books in one: the first one, the more boring one, served the sole purpose of changing a reader; and the second one, the more delightful, enjoyed by a changed reader.","Jul 08, 2012"

The author creatively addresses Turkey's relationship with modernity and the struggle to reconcile tradition and Westernization. I love the way Pamuk plays with narration at the end of the book, breaking the wall between author and reader. This work will keep me thinking for a long time... About the place of stories in our lives, about the dangers of reading too literally, and about that realm that can only be found within the pages of a book..

He falls in love with Janan (“soulmate”), who has arranged his finding the book as if by chance as part of her plot to restore her lover Mehmet’s faith in the very same book, one to which he had introduced her once upon a time.

Questioning the concepts of time, accident, ""life"" itself, as well as the in-between nature of Turkey between the east and the west, this novel is definitely one of the best Pamuk has ever written. His sentences sound far more poetic than the rest of his novels; becoming like those of Oguz Atay in some parts. Definitely a must read for anyone interested in Turkish literature.","Aug 26, 2009"

It represents the constant search for one self that drifts from a life changing experience, in this novel: Reading a book. One can relate to the character, and, as always, you learn to love in the same way that Pamuk's characters love, with such passion and such devotion that dwells between romance and melancholy..

It's the kind of book you just keep thinking about what it said long after you read it. I can't decide how I feel about the characters or what they did and I'd like to think that the book they read was evil but I just can't be so sure. I definitely loved the ending though..

You didn't get what I had written just now in a previous sentence? Neither did I having read the New Life.. Anyway, I bet you not to waste precious time with this roman.

The matter is, I, the reader, also had a book .. this book, which was doing the same to me! But the experience destroyed his normal life and made him face the terrible suspended interlude between life and death which is the indifferent abysmal current of consciousness..

When Pamuk drew parallels from real life and penned our thoughts and fears beautifully, I liked the book. When he turned to mysticism and went on about the angel, I was compelled to skip sentences.. In the end, to me, maybe I might read those pages before the final pages again, when I'm old and take life less seriously.

7038191,John,"I ummed and ahed about giving up on this book for ages.. This is rarely an easy decision for me; I feel like a failure if I don't finish a book.. It was a tough call. On the one hand, it is a beautifully written super-clever novel about dead deep things like life and love and death and whatnot. On the other hand, it is incredibly boring, and to be honest, the life I want isn't one where I feel encumbered by a tiresome novel that's blocking me from reading stuff I would find more enjoyable.. But then, might I learn something if I keep going? ... I mean, there's no doubt that Panuk is a serious clever-cloggs, and an extraordinarily skillful writer. He's tackling some fascinating philosophical themes ... surely I could learn from the Nobel Prize winner if only I could motivate myself to keep going?. But then, I read some more of the damn thing, and although it's beautiful, it all feels so pointless. I re-read some sentences and phrases for the pleasure of reading them again, sometimes saying them out loud; I read others because I lost concentration and had to retrace my steps. Then I realised it didn't matter, so what if my focus drifted and I read half a page without taking in a word ... nothing happened anyway, I was no worse off for skipping over it.. So why not skip over a couple of chapters? Or the whole damn thing?. The first sentence is compelling, ""I read a book one day, and my whole life was changed"", it already seemed to be living up to the promise of the blurb on the back (""feindishly engaging""), then the second sentence was quite good too, and the first chapter as Osman reads the book and becomes obsessed with it. The contrast with his humdrum home life is stark. He then finds Janan, who is also obsessed with the book, and falls in love with her in that first moment of meeting (always the best way to fall in love with someone), she is - he believes - his soulmate (""if the soulmate is absent, there is no use for the soul"") ... but then she disappears, and he, seeking the life in the book, drifts into a life on Turkey's night buses, watching people die in crashes, stealing cash from their fat wallets, and becoming increasingly aimless. This is where the book starts to get tough. It slows down, almost to a halt, losing all sense of direction. It meanders around, confusingly, and - worse - boringly. I suppose this is cleverly aping their (he finds Janan) life on the road as they meander around the rural steppes of Turkey in search of their own ""new life"", but at the end of the day, it's still a novel wandering around, and for all its beauty and clever ideas, it feels desperately weak on a coherent narrative arc, and that gets tiresome very quickly.. That said, there is something intriguing about the life they live, like it's happening on a different plane, or within in a different dimension, away from the bricks and mortar of the everyday world. When normal stuff happens, it's reassuring in one way, and makes for easier reading, but it's distracting too, as if the practical matters of existing in the real world get in the way of the more important journey they are on. This other dimension thing always fascinated me, and I used to wonder if it were possible to walk among the world, but be apart from it. As a child, I imagined famous people did this, so different their lives seemed. In the book this idea remains intangible, and we never get to the bottom of it. The fact that Pamuk conjours it up at all is impressive, and I guess you can't nail it down without it bursting and becoming just like everything else.. Maybe that's a load of pretentious crap, but - to be fair to me - ""YMCA"" was blaring out the kitchen radio when I wrote the above paragraph, so you have to make allowances.. Favourite sentence: ""I believe gossip of this sort is called 'history'"". So did I finish it?. Yes I did.. It's all very well putting a book down when it's a pile of crap that's beneath me, but this certainly wasn't that. It was too abstract for my taste, but it was obviously not crap. It was a book that challenged me to be a better reader, and so I limped my way to the end on principle, refusing to be beaten.","Oct 05, 2018"
11612758,Anna Baillie-Karas,"The narrator reads a book & goes off to find the meaning of life & win his beloved Janan. Slow to start, I was soon immersed in Pamuk's rich, lyrical prose. His sentences are intricate, but so exact they stop you in your tracks. I love the layers of meaning & imperfect characters.. He handles big themes - obsessive love, fanaticism, east v west - layered with recurring motifs (time, angels, buses) and cherishes everyday objects, described in lists that are achingly real. The collection of objects, and their meaning, is a recurring theme in Pamuk's work (eg in The Museum of Innocence) and I love the care he shows for these things that give texture to our lives.. Other themes that appear in his later work are at play: obsessive and one might say hopeless love (the museum of innocence again); the influence of the West and how young people who seek to preserve their traditions might become radicalised (explored in Silent House); the devotion to books and the process of writing and copying (My Name is Red) and the narrator identifying with a character who goes missing (The Black Book).. The narrator and Janan read 'the book' (we never learn what it is, but it could be analogous to the bible or Koran) & watch many films together, and Pamuk shows the interplay between life and entertainment. This reminded me of Infinite Jest - people read (or watch) to find meaning; the answer to the question of how - or why - to live, someone to save them. The narrator is obsessed with the book.. The 'angel' is portrayed as a mother figure who will enlighten them but also as the angel of death. Perhaps only at the point of death will the narrator know what he wanted to live for.","Aug 26, 2017"
15482033,Morgan,"Cynically-brilliant exploration of meaning making in the human psyche as told through a young man's search for ultimate Truth and Love during the '90s (check your gag response at the door). Let's call it a Turkish post-modern coming of age tale that smells strongly of SciFi. With scathing cultural criticism of both the Near East and the Far West more as its context than its point, the novel is disturbing, violent, mystifying, confusing, poignant and, for the most of its pages, kinda boring. Two problems I had with it were (1) the protagonist is unlikable or, should I just say, shallow, two-faced and despicable (which I suppose describes a lot of twenty-somethings), but doesn't make for fun reading (and I do read for fun). The second issue is a bone I pick with a lot of post-modern best-selling novelists, i.e. the use of long lists of dubious contribution to the work to, I assume, gather enough pages together to turn in a manuscript to their publishers on time--Rushdie is the biggest culprit of this lame use of print. Pamuk apparently learned from a pro. But hey, Ken Kesey woulda loved it--you're either on the bus or off the bus.","Jan 29, 2020"
1157324,Peter Dunn,"I thought I had better make some headway into my large pile of completely unread Orhan Pamuk books so where better to start, I thought, than with ‘The New Life’. It is one of earliest books and made his name with the reading public as, despite being hated by the professional reviewers, it became the fastest selling book in Turkish history at the time of its release (well according to a well known internet encyclopaedia site anyway - so it must be true…). It’s also, according to the advertising blurb, a book about a book so all in all I should like it surely?. Actually my best description of it can be summed in the four words: ‘Magic realism with buses’ - and I hate magic realism. I think the critics might have got this one right. Thankfully his (and the translator’s) writing style carried me through to the end of the book and on to another of his novels, ‘My Name is Red’ which I am enjoying far more than this one.","Aug 24, 2019"
19480957,Hasan San Jamous,"Spoilers. Please don't read if you haven't read the book yet.. God this book had such potential. There were so many deep ideas. The gun that was given to Osman from Mehmet father. That was used later to kill his own son. The idea of the printing press and how it's killing the traditional art or writing reminded of me of Red and the idea of perspective paintings. I loved the concept behind the new life and chasing new life and the ending was just great.. Now however, the book is terribly boring. It's horrible to read actually. I appreciate metaphors. They are great. But not when a whole book is made of metaphors! And it's so hard to get into and like the characters when they are so whiney and annoying all the time. I just couldn't stand it.

That's what made this book great for me.. “Sometimes I sensed that the books I read in rapid succession had set up some sort of murmur among themselves, transforming my head into an orchestra pit where different musical instruments sounded out, and I would realize that I could endure this life because of these musicales going on in my head.”","Sep 19, 2019"

39835326,voulpit,"This is the second book from Orhan Pamuk that I have read, and I was impressed from the first pages with its direction. Of course, it has a base story, but behind that it is full of Turkish symbols. I don't think I have understood it all, but definitely there are some quotes there that surprised me, and entire pages. Some symbols that appear are: tv screen, radio (which seem to capture more and more people), the plastic bag, death and accidents, the angel, the trains. But the ramble itself, alone or with the beloved, is awesome to read, the halts, the role playing.... Later in the book, it takes a conspiracy turn, forces of the traditional go against penetrations of the modernity (""The biggest enemy of the call to prayer is the train schedule""). Ultimately the latter ones win. The book loses quality in the last few chapters though, despite how inspiring and amazing it is in most parts - the ending is sprinkled with melancholy and various descriptions and connections the author makes.. Is interesting what the author was trying to transmit (if I understood correctly), and if we were to take out the nostalgic part in the end.. Total score: 4.5*. --- Not the least --- we are lucky to benefit from a exquisite translation of the book in Romanian language (LM did her job well, unlike, for example, the cumbersome translators of Elif Shafak's books, who don't even translate directly from Turkish anymore...)","Aug 07, 2019"
9116505,Vaidya,"There is always this feeling with Pamuk works that you are a satellite skimming the surface of a planet trying to get in. No matter how hard you try, you still say at the same height, not able to find your way in - it gets frustrating. Mind you, it's not like it's boring, there is always a flow of events, of stories, of passages that pull you in and engage you at multiple levels. It's just that they don't seem to add up to a coherent whole. You know there's something that he's playing at, and he keeps throwing hints about at you, but it always stays outside your grasp. And then there's a phase when you stop caring and go with the flow towards the end. There is that core, you probably haven't figured it out yet, but you don't care anymore - it'll probably come to you when it has to. And then you reach the ending - another Pamuk novel done, 4 stars given, the extra star missing because he played with you a bit too much.. And then the fun begins. Snatches that come in at different times, when you contemplate your own life, your own history and identity. Those old roads that you pass through and think of how things were and how they are now with all those cars lining those then-empty streets. It is scary how much you can relate to him, considering that his main trope is identity, delineating that of the East against the relentless assault from the West, set almost always in Istanbul that city that sits right at the crossroads. There is also that of History, trying to snatch it away from those who want to write it, saying ""It's ours! We get to choose how we write!"" And thus flow the stories, the myths, the legends - the ways we store our histories and pass it on verbally by telling them to strangers we meet and are forced to spend time with - in buses, in bars, in trains.. In many ways, this book is also an elegy, for what once was, for the memories of childhood, for the sadness that memories get intertwined with dreams forming one indistinguishable entity. Of having to live in a city one grew up in, but unable to identify with anymore. And this is where most Pamuk books stay with you. The rest is the usual - a loser' hero, a girl that he pines for who's mysterious and never truly his. Think Ka and Ipek, think Galip and Ruya. Pamuk works because he attacks the same concept from different levels. That's also why he endures long after you finish reading.. I only wished there was. Maureen Freely. doing the translation - that heady prose was sorely missed.","Apr 06, 2015"

694237,Kristin,"As I was coming close to finishing this book, I began to wonder what I would tell someone about it. It has been one of those books where I feel like I have been on the verge of either loving or hating the direction it might take, and while I found the narrative frustrating at times, Pamuk's writing intrigued me enough to stick with it.. As I was trying to decide how I felt about this book, I wondered if I had too much baggage from the previous book I read and very much enjoyed--Jose Saramago's The Double. Can we ever really review a book without bringing baggage to the table? It was difficult for me to transition back to novels after reading a lot of literary criticism for my thesis. Diving in a Jose Saramago novel was like diving into a cold pool at first, it was a shock to the system. But, then, the water was fine.. Saramago is sprawling. He always occupies significant space in my head. Based on writing style alone, it was a challenge to go from The Double to The New Life.. I was drawn to this book's premise--a book changes the life of a man. It is about this man's journey to find the life inside a book. What I enjoyed best was his search for the journey, and then how Pamuk relates his hero's attempt to recover from the journey. The journey itself was a difficult trip for me.. In the end, I'll say I liked this book. I will read more of Pamuk. The author actually gives an interesting explanation as to why his hero desires to read books. I think Pamuk's own explanation is a fine one for any person to give this book, or any other, a go:. ""If books awakened in me the urge to talk, the conversation often took place between the voices in my head. Sometimes I sensed that the books I read in rapid succession had set up some orchestra pit where different musical instruments sounded out, and I would realize that I could endure this life because of these musicales going on in my head.

31264299,Stephanie Jane (Literary Flits),"I registered a book at BookCrossing.com!. http://www.BookCrossing.com/journal/12747714. I was lucky enough to win a copy of Snow a couple of years ago and absolutely loved Orhan Pamuk's writing. His poetic descriptions are beautiful and I managed to completely lose myself in the book. So when I saw a copy of The New Life on a second-hand stall in Bristol, I snapped it up.. The New Life is a mix of books in one. There is the stunning writing in which to lose yourself, a road journey through a Turkey which is being lost even as our narrator discovers it, and a splash of mysticism to aid and baffle the reader in equal measure! The seemingly unending bus journeys are brilliantly portrayed, both their tedium and the mortal risk of boarding. I did not completely understand everything as I read it, although much later became clear with further chapters and, as with Snow, I need to learn more about Turkish culture in order to appreciate all the cultural references.. However this was definitely a full five-star read for me. The characters of Osman, Janan and Mehmet are driven and compulsive, and I felt for their quest to discover the truth behind the book they had read. I would so love to read 'that book' too! My favourite character was Doctor Fine and I certainly sympathised with and understood his battle to slow the oncoming tide of globalisation, or Westernisation as it was to him, and his sadness at it destroying the small lifestyle details that made his Turkey his country. The New Life was originally published twenty years ago and I guess the onslaught has increased since then there as it also has in many other countries. If nothing else, I will take away from this book a renewed desire to Buy Local and support regional producers.","Jun 25, 2014"
5252683,Kalika,"I started this book with very high expectations; it was written by Orhan Pamuk (one of my favourite writers), it was very highly recommended, it was about Turkey. And who would not be enticed by a book that began with ""I read a book one day and my whole life was changed"". Mid-way into the book I was really confused, I got the allegorical style, I got the post-modern/metafiction devices, I got the ""brain"" of the book but couldn't get to its ""heart"". I was not sure whether I liked the book or not till I read the last 100 pages.. The story of Osman, an engineering student, who read a book that lead him to wander aimlessly with Janan, the girl who had lead him to the book and love. Bus journey after bus journey through obscure towns in Turkey, the two obsessively search for the new life promised by the book. The story of youth and its belief in an elusive new life promised to them, the story of heartsick traditions giving way reluctantly, belligerantly to inevitable westernization, the story of unrequited love, the story of the power of printed word.. The narrative is meandering, slow, and sometimes tedious but you do carry on and in the end, I was glad I did. In the end, the story of Osman is besides the point, you really don't care what happens to him or to Janan. The book is after all about the meaning that each individual ascribes to his own life, the upheavel, the change that should be important and meaningful germinates in mundane thoughts and actions and is not what we expect or desire after all. The angel of desire is a fake and the true angel is the one that we see in the end. That never changes for all life the only constant is its end.","Oct 02, 2012"
39349020,Jordan McKay,"Metaphysically wandering through the Turkish hinterland using bus services that are prone to crash, we find Osman. He reads a book one day, and suddenly his whole world doesn't make sense anymore. From this largely esoteric narrative we are provided an insight into Turkey's cultural colonisation by the USA, and we see local businessmen attempting to stave off big brands in attempts to maintain the authenticity of Turkish products. Osman's Uncle wrote books for children, supporting the convergence of these two nations through representations of a young Turkish boy and a young American boy helping each other to solve conundrums.. This is 'The New Life.'. The dissemination of culture from Global superpowers due to the globalisation of the market space isn't didactically spelled out here by Pamuk but it is most definitely central to the novel's plot and setting. And so, Osman finds himself pursuing 'the Angel' of the book. Relentlessly scouring the Turkish countryside by living almost exclusively on buses for periods of time in hopes of his bus colliding with another, for this is when the Angel appears: at the moment just prior to death in this life.. Osman's pursuit of The New Life is halted somewhat, as he gives up looking for the Angel - he settles into a humdrum married life until several years later he is reawakened to a country transformed by American influence. Billboards litter the hinterland and bus attendants now wear uniforms and the Old Turkey is dead, while this new mutated version lives on. Orhan Pamuk's novel deals excellently with this theme, providing us with a elegiac swan song to the culture of a pre-globalised nation state.","Jan 16, 2017"
9647467,Apoorva,"Um...well. It's three stars on the Pamuk Fangirl Scale, mind you. Otherwise it's a good four.. It didn't engross me until I got to the second half...and even then, the style just didn't seem Pamuk enough. Objectively of course, it's rather good, even if seemingly jagged, superficial & pretentious. Had this been my first Pamuk (or something I had read before reading Borges), I would've been blown over. A beautiful ode to the art & importance of reading and how books can actually take over your life...but not a perfect Pamuk, like I said. He seems to struggle to find his voice...I would've been okay if he had written this before he wrote The Black Book (or even if I had read it before I read that dizzying dazzler).. That said, there are a few paragraphs every few pages that remind you that it's indeed Pamuk...I don't know if I should blame it on the translation...The Black Book had seemed so effortless....as had My Name is Red...and the ending kinda redeems everything..... So overall, a decent ride, but the Pamuk fangirl in me didn't feel as taken in as she usually does while reading him, Marquez, Borges & Kundera.. A teeny confession: I wanted it to be over quickly, and not because I was dying to know what happens in the end- but because I wanted to move to the rest of my birthday cart, whereas with The Black Book, I had felt an indescribable sadness on reaching the end. Not to mention weak-kneed wonder.. I'll certainly come back to it later, just to see if there were things I missed out.","Nov 27, 2012"
55792949,Tejas,"Reading Orhan Pamuk is an exercise in learning and unlearning. This book was the third in my journey of understanding the author.. The New Life follows the journey of individuals who, captivated by a book they read, seek to implement its principles, and achieve its conclusion – the prospect of a new life. The protagonist, Osman, notices the book as his friend, Janan sets it down – buying his own copy shortly thereafter. Subsequently, Janan introduces Osman to her boyfriend, Mehmet – who is shortly gunned down at a bus stop. As Mehmet is untraceable, Janan and Osman end up taking bus journeys – which are violent, and surreal, in an attempt to find Mehmet. Ultimately, they find Mehmet’s father, Dr. Fine, who – as the antagonist in the story, has attempted to curb the readership of the book, by murdering individuals who follow its teachings using a network of spies. The book concludes with a revelation of the book’s actual author – who is related to Osman.. This is a summary of the plot. The nuance involved, along with Pamuk’s writing style, makes this an extremely heavy, complex read. As a result, unlike his other works, I don’t think this is his most accessible novel. It left me feeling several mixed feelings.. Full review at:. https://pageswithtejas.wordpress.com/...","Jan 26, 2019"
4815396,Notme,"Held my interest despite the fact that it was not what I intended to read. The description I read was somewhat deceptive, leading me to expect a historical thriller. This was not it at all. It's a poetic story of searching for identity, lost world, world that might have been, but never was, and will never be. of passing of the old world, with it's mysteries and craftsmanship and nostalgia felt when we meet some little sign of the things that passed or are passing away. Of desires we have and don't understand why we have them, of love unfulfilled and dreamed about, and finally of all those thins destroying the only life we have if we let them. Very descriptive, beautifully written, but if you expect an action, this book is not it.","Jun 14, 2011"
1058939,Diane,"Set in contemporary Turkey, this novel begins with the author reading a book that completely changes his life. The reader is never told what this remarkable book is about, but the author falls in love with the young woman who he first sees reading it, and then spends much time traveling about the country in search of a vision from the book. Eventually, the author turns his back on those dreams and settles down to a conventional life, but he is always haunted by what he left behind. The writing style is beautiful, and the author does a good job of capturing the sense of longing in the characters' hearts. He also does a good job of portraying the Turks as caught between the East and West, not really sure where they belong.","Dec 18, 2012"
21847297,Ned Hanlon,"This is a confused and confusing book that just never quite comes together. Open the book and each page is beautiful: fabulously written, filled with riddles, paradoxes, epigrams and wonderful images. But the net result is a failure; in this case the whole is lesser than the sum of its parts. Pamuk seems to strive for Nabokov or Borges, but tops out as a poor man's Umberto Eco. My Name is Red is his Name of the Rose; The New Life is his Prague Cemetery or Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana.. I do think everyone should try Pamuk, if only for the beauty of some of his prose (though probably My Name is Red over The New Life). However, it will be some time before I pick up another of his books.","May 24, 2015"
52931894,Kilmandaros,"I have had three attempts at this book in 6 years and finally now, i managed to finish it. It isn't an easy read but an excellent piece of literature,with wonderful language, a very smartly spun tale, sharp eyes to the tiniest but all the more interesting details, the narrator/hero has an unusually deep character which is being opened up to the reader slowly but to incredibly detail and the book has its own magical moments that suck you in completely. This book needs patience and a certain level of emotional intelligence, maybe some familiarity with Turkish culture to appreciate its real worth. When i started reading it six years ago I certainly did not have much of any of those prerequisites but after reading it now, i have to say, it's a true masterpiece.","Sep 30, 2016"
821081,Lauren,"Interesting book.. The New Life, to me, told the story of a young man unsure of his place in the world who was easily swayed to find importance in anything. In his case, the anything happened to be the book. Upon making that decision, his whole life found a meaning, and unfolded around understanding and conquering the book. His whole life now having meaning resulted in his whole life being spent searching for answers that ultimately were useless except for the purpose of having something to concentrate on. However, in his case I believe he realized what he had done, and in that found his real self and a real desire for life; even though it was too late.","Feb 22, 2010"
5298208,Ryan Brightwell,"Compelling and strange, but leaves you feeling ultimately unfulfilled. The protagonist, unnamed for most of the book, is thrown at the start into a kind of psychedelic wonderland through reading a certain book (also unnamed). He then moves from a quest for enlightenment and 'The New Life' to what could be described as a long comedown.... The setting, in Istanbul and the small dusty towns of the Anatolian steppe, is evovative. But the author seems to be self-consciously rebelling against the idea of a traditional story arc, instead moving from the fantastic to the mundane and, well, leaving you there. With a bump.. That said, it left me wanting to check out some more of Pamuk's work.","Jul 01, 2012"
1719314,Jacek,"The author of this book isn't quiet yet the Orhan Pamuk that excites me, but as in. The Black Book. (if a little less so this time), he peeks around street corners often enough. I liked the early to middle section best, in which the narrator chases catastrophic bus crashes around Anatolia. I imagine that if this had been retranslated by Maureen Freely like its predecessor was, I'd have given an extra star, whereas Güneli Gün's dated translation is too often distracting and off-putting. None of the students in my small Pamuk class were thrilled either, and when I mentioned at the end of our class that this was a smash hit in Turkey, everybody looked surprised.","Aug 31, 2019"
685245,Dad,"After having read Pamuk's short stories in the New Yorker, and really enjoying them, I was looking forward to a full-length book. I am very let down, as I could not even begin to understand it- I might as well have been reading Greek. Uncomprehensible in the extreme. Thoughts expressed at the beginning of a paragraph that morph into the opposite thought at the end of the same. Much like a dream, but even more confusing. Don't buy it- I'll give you my copy. I will attempt ""Istanbul,"" the book he received the Nobel prize for, and hope for better luck.","Jan 09, 2008"
16187712,Leila Ekrami,"“The plot centers around a young engineering student in Istanbul who discovers a ""new life"" in the pages of a book of the same name. The protagonist is so thrilled by this novel that he sets off in search of the new life it describes, finding a number of other readers who have become similarly consumed as well as a few people who seek to destroy the book because of the effect it has its followers. No passages from the book are revealed, and the audience is left to hypothesize about its nature through the actions of the main character and other obsessed readersnovel”","Dec 17, 2008"
2220222,Denerick,"What a pathetic excuse for a book, made even worse by the fact that I really enjoyed Snow and White Castle. Just read this book again; it gives the impression of saying a lot whilst simultaneously saying nothing of any importance whatsoever; its poorly written, infuriating and anal. It tries to grasp massive themes but fails miserably. I'm not normally this vitriolic but it is only because before this I had such a high regard for Pamuk. I'll try 'My Name is Red', and hopefully my faith in the man will be restored, but this waste of paper is very capable of making one extremely dystopian.","Dec 11, 2009"
3005178,Margarida,"I'm deeply in love with the way he writes. Pamuk is a brilliant writer and I want to visit Turkey just because of his delicious descriptions and details of the country, its habits, etc etc.. This book annoyed me, though. I found myself reading some pages and not really understanding the words. I tried to, because his words are beautiful and I like how they sound in my mind, but this story was just too strange and boring and confusing. I swear I tried to read the whole thing, but I couldn't. I still love Orhan Pamuk, though. The Museum of Innocence took my breath away.","Jan 25, 2011"
1947209,Ryna,"I was so disappointed by this book. I loved Pamuk's Snow and My Name is Red. His writing is poetic, transcendent, and wonderfully layered in meaning. I did not find those elements in this book. Granted, he did wrote this years before those 2 other novels so his style may have undergone a considerable change during those years. I also tend to dislike stories as a whole when the narrator is a character I dislike or can't relate with. But while this may have been a factor, this is one of the few books I really struggled to finish.","Dec 15, 2012"
17817006,Katherine Graham,"An excellent book, a slow but endlessly rewarding read. The protagonist becomes obsessed simultaneously with a book and a girl, and thus his whole life is changed.. Both the contents of the book and the character of his love interest remain somewhat hidden from us. The words of the book are hinted at and Janan fails to make herself available to him, and consequently to us. What remains then is a richly meandering journey of introspection, pitched against the backdrop of a Turkey poised between East and West, between past and furture.","Feb 25, 2013"
10352435,Giulia,"The first third of this book was really putting me off, I have to admit. The story didn't seem to be going anywhere, the prose was roundabout and the characters uninteresting. However, the second third really picked up and I was enamoured with the thrills and secrets that were being revealed. Finally, the last third was my favourite, drawing a good conclusion to the end of the whole adventure. In all, you need patience to read this book, and a bit of an open mind. I was perhaps too grounded to follow some metaphysical tracks, but one can still appreciate.","Jul 20, 2015"

315416,Peter,"Wonderful beginning - - a fantastically gripping opening 30 pages. And it's deliciously meta- as it's about someone beginning to read a book. For me, New Life is the key to Pamuk's later work, as you see more clearly the almost recursive yet open-ended narrative loops or movements that tantalize in Snow and Red. Not that I'm diligent enough to really study this, but it's this feeling of movement, returning, repeating, looping inwards and outwards that is so intriguing in Pamuk.","May 08, 2009"

I am at loss whether this book discusses the destructive effect of books, the benefits of reading, the horror of writing and rewriting, the glory of the antics, the fear of westernization, the unrequited love, or just the void..

(نقل از اومبرتو اکو)؛ پاموک اعتراف می‌کند، تمام شخصیت‌ها در رمان «خانه خاموش»، بازتابی از او و احوالات متفاوت درونی ‌ایشان است؛ «کودکی ‌ام همواره با این تصور گذشت، که اورهانی دیگر، در خانه ی دیگری است»؛ اورهان پاموک، نویسنده نوبلیست ترک که در سال 1952میلادی، در خانواده ی پر جمعیتی در شهر استانبول ترکیه، به دنیا آمدند، تا سن بیست و دو سالگی، رویای نقاش شدن در سر داشتند؛ «این ایده نخست مورد تشویق، و حمایت خانواده ‌ام قرار گرفت، و این درحالی بود، که بیشتر افراد خانواده ی من، مهندس عمران بودند؛ پدر و مادرم، در مورد خواهر و برادرهایم می‌گفتند این یکی به همان مدرسه ‌ای خواهد رفت، که پدربزرگشان می‌رفت؛ آن یکی به مدرسه عمویش، و این یکی هم - که منظورشان من بودم – مهندس معمار خواهد شد»؛ این ایده، بعد‌ها با یک تصمیم سریع، و آنی، به یکباره از ذهن او پاک شد، و به نقطه ی عطف زندگی ‌اش، یعنی داستان نویسی انجامید؛ «همه ‌چیز را به یکباره کنار گذاشتم، تحصیل، نقاشی، معماری، وهمه را...؛ خود را در اتاقم حبس کردم، و مشغول نوشتن شدم؛ حالا که مردم از من این سئوال را می‌پرسند، که چطور توانستم در دهه ی سی زندگی، به عنوان یک رمان نویس، در ترکیه شناخته شوم؛ یا اینکه چرا نقاشی، و معماری را، رها کردم، من درست مثل گوزنی، که به چراغ جلو ماشینی، زل زده باشد، به آنها خیره می‌شوم، چرا که برای این پرسش پاسخی وجود ندارد»؛ ایشان در سنین پایین دریافتند، که نقاشی کردن، نظم و انضباط درونی می‌طلبد، و یک دنیا تنهایی...؛ که از این منظر، تالیف هم کاملا شبیه به آن است، و با خلق و خوی او سازگار...؛. درست همانند خود پاموک، که خیالپردازی، جزو جدایی ناپذیر زندگی ‌اش است، شخصیت‌های داستان‌هایش نیز، پیوسته در حال خیالبافی هستند؛ رمان «خانه خاموش»، که دومین اثر ایشانست، و به باور خودش، از دل رمان «جودت ‌بیک و پسران»، نخستین رمانش ‌زاده شده؛ حکایت آدم‌هایی است، که هیچیک از وضعیت فعلی خود، راضی نیستند، و رویای دیگری بودن را، در سر می‌پرورانند؛ مراد گلسوی، نویسنده ی ترک، در باره ی «دنیای ادبی اورهان پاموک»، می‌نویسند «ابتدا به نظر می‌رسد که شخصیت‌های رمان خانه خاموش، رویاهایی از جنس رویاهای همه آدم‌ها، در سر دارند، اما دلتنگی ژرفی که شخصیت‌های رمان، آنرا تجربه می‌کنند، هر قدر هم که این دلتنگی در رمان‌ها مشخصه ی دنیای شرق، محسوب شود، بیشتر، یک اندیشه، و واهمه ی جهانی ست، چرا که خواست دیگری بودن، منجر به این واهمه می‌شود، که نمی‌توان خود بود!»؛ انگین کیلیچ، در مقاله ی خود، به نام «اصوات خانه خاموش»، می‌نویسند «همه در خانه خاموش غمگینند، و عقده‌ های حقارت آنها، ازجنس فقر، عقب ‌ماندگی، شرقی بودن، بی ‌پدری، و مسائلی از این قبیل است؛. بیشتر این شخصیت‌ها، با ناامیدی، دلباخته ی فرد نامناسب خود هستند؛ اما تمام اینها نه در قالب رمانی مالیخولیایی، و غمگین، که گاه حتی به صورت رمانی شاد، و سرزنده روبرویمان ظاهر می‌شود. با این وجود، همین که رمان به پایان می‌رسد، چیزی به نام خوشبینی، برای خوانشگر باقی نمی‌ماند!»؛ «خواب، در اثرِ یک فعل و انفعال شیمیایی، روی می‌دهد، و مثل رویدادهای دیگر، دلیل علمی و منطقی دارد؛ همانطور که روزی فرمول آب، کشف شد، روزی فرمول خواب را هم، کشف می‌کنند»؛ اینها نخستین جملاتی هستند که ما را با تفکر پوزیتیویستی صلاح ‌الدین، در «خانه خاموش»؛ آشنا می‌کند؛ همسرش فاطمه، درست در نقطه ی مقابل شخصیت او قرار دارد»؛ صلاح ‌الدین تمام عمرش را، صرف تالیف دایرة ‌المعارفش می‌کند، چون عامل عقب ‌ماندگی شرق را، جهالت و عدم آگاهی مردم، می‌داند؛ رویای او، بیدار کردن شرق است، حتی اگر شده به زور...؛ فاطمه اما، به گذشته ی خود بسیار پایبند است؛ و رویای یگانه ‌اش، بازگشت به گذشته، و گذران حیاتی عاری از گناه است؛ او از مدرنیته بیزار است، و هر چیز جدید را تصنعی، و ساختگی می‌داند. فاطمه، در بیان نفرت خود، از کلمه ی «پلاستیک»، زیاد استفاده می‌کند؛ به گفته ی خودش، عطر‌ها دیگر نه در ظرف‌های شیشه ای، که در ظرف‌های پلاستیکی، فروخته می‌شوند؛ و ماشین‌های پلاستیکی، جای درشکه ‌ها را گرفته ‌اند؛ او حتی تا به آنجا پیش می‌رود، که قلب نوه ‌هایش را هم پلاستیکی می‌داند!؛. از دیگر شخصیت‌های رمان «خانه خاموش»، که مولفه ی خیالپردازی در او به روشنی دیده می‌شود، شخصیت «حسن» است؛ او یک ناسیونالیست افراطی ست، که به خاطر بی ‌پولی، از پولدارها متنفر است؛ جایی در قلب هیچ زنی ندارد، پس از زن‌ها هم بیزار است، و چون خودش خوشحال نیست، از همه ی آدم‌های خوشحال هم، بدش می‌آید؛ او هم مانند «صلاح ‌الدین» با این آرزو زندگی می‌کند، که روزی خواهد توانست، کارهای بزرگی انجام دهد؛ حسن که درگیر عقده ‌های خود کم ‌بینی ست، روزی را تصور می‌کند، که صاحب کارخانه ‌ای ست، و هفت هزار نفر، کارگر، به همراه یک زن دستیار مسلمان، زیر دست او، کار می‌کنند؛ یا روزی که فرماندار شده است، و نیلگون را در حالی که عجز و لابه می‌کند، کت ‌بسته پیش او می‌آورند، و او به دست و پای حسن می‌افتد، تا دستور دهد آزادش کنند. در سویی دیگر، «متین» را می‌بینیم، که آن «دیگری» برای او، یک میلیاردر معروف است؛ به زعم او، پول حرف اول را در دنیا می‌زند؛ حتی می‌بینیم که بیش از مرگ پدر و مادرش، از اینکه مرگ آنها، میراثی برای او به همراه نداشته، ناراحت، و دلگیر است؛ رویای متین، گاه در قالب یک میلیاردر زن‌‌باره، و گاه در قالب یک دانشمند فیزیک، متبلور می‌شود. رجب، کوتوله ی خدمتکاری ست، که همانند فاطمه، رویایش نه معطوف به آینده، که بازگشت به گذشته است؛ گهگاهی دلتنگ شنیدن قصه‌ های مادرش می‌شود، و دلش می‌خواهد، تا دوباره به آن روزها بازگردد؛ او با اینکه به ظاهر به زندگی یکنواخت خود، خو کرده، اما «دیگری ‌بودن»، خوابی ست، که همه در «خانه خاموش» آن را دیده‌ اند...؛. درد «فاروق» اما، درد دیگری است. او که پیوسته خود را در کارزار جدال با روح دوگانه ‌اش می‌یابد، رویای داشتن روح واحد را، در سرش می‌پروراند؛ و همین وجه تمایز او، با سایر شخصیت‌های رمان است که رویای پول، شهرت، و انجام کارهای مهم، دارند؛ فاروق، از این دوگانگی، به ستوه آمده، و با تمام وجود، وحدت، و روح یگانه، طلب می‌کند؛ در زیرزمین نمور بایگانی، نه به جستجوی تاریخ، که در اصل در پی یافتن خویشتن است. و اما «نیلگون»، یک انقلابی بی ‌تجربه، و تازه کار، که خود راوی نیست، و از زبان سایر شخصیت‌ها، به مخاطب معرفی می‌شود؛ حتی شاید بتوان او را، بداقبال‌ترین شخصیت، این خانه معرفی کرد؛ نیلگون «پدرها و پسرها» را، می‌خواند، و رویای تغییر اصول، و قراردادهای اجتماعی در سر دارد، گرچه خوانشگر اینها را از زبان خود او نمی‌شنود. پاموک اعتراف می‌کند که «تک‌تک جوان‌های این رمان، خود من هستند...»؛ و اذعان می‌کند، از بین رمان‌هایی، که تا به امروز نوشته، «خانه خاموش» بیشترین محبوبیت را در میان جوان‌ها داشته، و دلیلش را هم در این می‌داند، که در این کتاب، چیزهایی در رابطه با دوران جوانی، و احوالات درونی خود را، نوشته است «برای نوشتن خانه خاموش، از اتفاقات زیادی الهام گرفتم، که یکی از آنها نامه ‌هایی بود، که پدربزرگم، در سال‌های جوانی، برای مادربزرگم می‌نوشت؛ پدربزرگم، در آن سال‌ها، برای تحصیل در رشته ی حقوق، عازم برلین، می‌شود؛ اما پیش از سفر، با مادربزرگم، نامزد می‌شوند، و آنطور که می‌گویند، او در سال‌های تحصیل خود در آلمان، نامه ‌های زیادی برای نامزدش، می‌نویسد، که مضمون و حال و هوای آن نامه ‌ها، بی‌شباهت به درس‌هایی نیست، که آقای صلاح ‌الدین، به همسرش فاطمه می‌دهد؛ این را هم می‌دانم، که عکس ‌العمل مادر بزرگ من هم، درست مثل فاطمه، از جنس بی ‌توجهی و «گناه و حرام» بوده...؛ با تصور رابطه ی سرد و ناموفقی، که احتمالا بین آن دو می‌گذشته، من، نخستین جملات رمان خانه ی خاموش را نوشته ام»؛ پایان نقل از نوشتار مترجم رمان خانه خاموش؛ ا. شربیانی","Mar 23, 2012"
597461,Elyse  Walters,"I liked this - almost as much as ""The Museum of Innocence"", which is still my favorite Orhan Pamuk novel.... but it's close. ( it's a smaller book - less 'dense' than other Pamuk books I've read-- each chapter is short).. Right from the start the dialogue between the cranky old grandmother and Recep - her FRICKIN SLAVE HORSE -- a Saint to boot-is a dwarf.... making the visuals of the dialogue all the more hysterically crazy-funny....( shaking your head: ""you've got to be kidding""). Recep is a bastard of her deceased husband.. The grandchildren are coming for a visit who each have their individual quirks, habits, and emotional hurts. During their visit they begin to explore their country's history.. The conflicts we see within the family parallel with the conflicts that we see politically. between modern Turkey and their past which was rooted in more traditional religious beliefs.. I was in Turkey in 1973-74...Istanbul was a different place than it is today. Reading Pamuk always triggers memories- and expands my views at the same time.","Aug 11, 2017"
8505940,Paul Gleason,"Originally published in Turkey in 1983 and now translated into English for the first time, Silent House (Knopf) is Orhan Pamuk's second novel. Although the Nobel Prize-winner makes no direct mention of the historical relevance of the book in the text itself, his story takes place roughly one month before the September 12, 1980 Turkish coup d'état, in which the Chief of the General Staff General Kenan Evren and the Turkish Armed Forces restored order after violence had broken out between right-leaning nationalists and communists. An Army-contolled National Security Council then ruled Turkey until 1983, when democracy was restored.. So why is Silent House relevant to English-language readers in 2012, almost thirty years after the book's publication? The answer lies in a statement made by one of Pamuk's minor characters - a pharmacist named Kemal Bey: ""[Politics is] everywhere. . . . No matter where you go, it grabs you by the collar."". Kemal refers to the beating of Nilgün, a young woman who runs afoul of Hasan, an extreme and equally young Turkish nationalist, for buying a communist newspaper. Very sexually attracted to Nilgün, Hasan kicks and punches her for her ""crime,"" just as much out of a sense of adolescent machismo and tough-guy posturing. The point is that Hasan is too immature to come to terms with his physical urges - and his body becomes the site of a dilemma that for Pamuk in Silent House and in his mature novels characterizes Turkey. Should Hasan follow the stereotypical view of Western culture and try to have sex with a woman to whom he's attracted? Or should he follow the stereotypical view of Eastern culture and attack a woman with left-wing values?. For Pamuk, Turkey - and, in particular, Istanbul - is a liminal space, where history has entangled Western and Eastern values to such an extent that it's the most valuable setting for the novelist to explore some of the key political issues of our time. It's a place where political factions live and breathe side-by-side, as they constantly brush up against each other in public street corners, coffeehouses, and alleyways - but also in the privacy of family homes.. And these family homes are the most dangerous places for Pamuk because they harbor silence and implicit consent to violence. They're where violence begins. Indeed, the silent house of the novel's title truly serves as Pamuk's description and condemnation of the silence that beats at the heart of Turkey. The house - which is located just outside Istanbul, in Cennethisar - brings together three generations of Turks when three young people, including Nilgün, visit Grandmother Fatma and her dwarf son Precep. But the generations are sadly cut off from each other. They squabble about petty matters. They, however, don't discuss their inner thoughts, the political implications of which are obvious. For example, Fatma mostly lingers alone in her bedroom and broods on the Western values of her deceased husband and his unfinished encyclopedia in which he considers death and Nothingness, her grandson Faruk thinks long and deeply about whether history is a story or reality, and a second grandson, Metin, ponders the virtues of Western materialism. Pamuk's Silent House is really Turkey itself.. Which is a shame because silence can only hold for so long before violence erupts. Profoundly anti-violence, Silent House is Pamuk's early cry for tolerance, reason, and communication during a time when democracy was on the line and, indeed, temporarily lost in Turkey. It's necessary reading, especially for those of us in the United States who recognize similarly sharp political divisions.","Jun 10, 2012"
6743601,Jim Fonseca,"Turkey’s on-going modernization, real estate boom, and politics are the focus of this story, set in a small Turkish seaside city, we guess, around the 1970’s. The book was originally published in Turkey in 1983. The plot is that three adult grandchildren make their obligatory annual summer visit to their 90 year-old grandmother. The grandmother is crotchety and demanding especially to her live-in servant whom she alternately calls “the dwarf” or “the bastard,” the latter because he is a child of her dead husband’s mistress. Her grandchildren “…still haven’t figured out their grandmother isn’t capable of any reaction except disgust.” ‘The Dwarf’ is the perfect servant, catering to the old lady’s and everyone else’s every need and whim despite the disdain and abuse.. The youngest grandchild is in high school, ready to go to college, hopefully abroad, but he has no money to do so and is hoping grandma will sell the house to finance his education. He hangs out with a fast set of upper-class Turkish kids who drink, smoke pot and carouse in sports cars. The oldest grandson is a college professor, divorced, a dreamer, and an alcoholic. In the last two traits he carries on a strong set of genes, because he is a third generation dreamer and alcoholic. The grandfather, now deceased, was a medical doctor who got crosswise with Istanbul politicians and spent his life in exile in this backwater town drinking and toiling over a 50-volume encyclopedia “to bring Western knowledge to the East.” He was an avowed atheist, which terrified his devout wife, the grandmother. Their only son, now dead, the father of the three children, was a local low-level civil servant, also a dreamer and an alcoholic. The granddaughter is a radical socialist, which gets her in serious trouble with the nationalist skin-heads in town.. The book is a good read, even though it is an early work by Pamuk, translated only after he became famous for his other works. It has a lot of local color of Turkey and it’s a primer on why much of the developing world is in such chaos.","May 31, 2015"

3438671,Lisabet Sarai,"I spent several weeks reading Orhan Pamuk’s Silent House. Pamuk’s books are dense and difficult, but well worth the effort, if one measures this by those “aha” moments occasionally triggered by great literature.. Silent House is Pamuk’s second novel, first published in 1983. On the surface, it’s the story of a single family. In her second floor room, in the old house in a seaside village where she has spent her adult life, a frail ninety year old widow awaits the annual visit of her three grandchildren: overweight, alcoholic Faruk, a professor obsessed with history; his stylish, left-leaning younger sister Nilgün; and materialistic, self-absorbed college student Metin, who is saving his money to go to America and become a captain of industry. The dwarf Recep, now a faithful servant to the grandmother, is in fact her husband’s illegitimate son, crippled due to her treatment of him as a child. Teen-aged Hasan is the son of Recep’s bastard brother and a member of a thuggish nationalist gang. The overall mood is one of dissatisfaction, bitterness and decay.. Each chapter is an intimate, in many cases disturbing, peek into the mind of one of the characters—grandmother Fatma, Faruk, Recep, Metin and Hasan (but not, interestingly, Nilgün). These first person narratives come close to stream of consciousness. They portray the ebb and flow of emotion, the irrationality of thought, the occasionally overwhelming physical sensation. The effect in each case is one of intense isolation, which becomes more oppressive as the book proceeds towards its shocking and violent conclusion.. I particularly appreciated the depiction of Fatma’s inner life. She is not suffering from dementia, but she experiences the objects in her environment and especially the passage of time in an almost hallucinatory manner. I found her mental wanderings totally convincing. It’s plausible to me that when one reaches such an advanced age, so-called reality might begin to waver.. However, these distinctive, vivid characters are not the author’s deepest concern. Fundamentally, I believe, Silent House is a book about perception, memory and history. The book was published on the eve of a nationalist coup. I don’t know enough about Turkish history to appreciate the specific references, but the messages are more universal. Pamuk’s characters share a loss of connection to the past, a distrust of the present, and a sense of inferiority that leads them to actions they know are wrong, but which they cannot resist.. I was surprised that this author’s early work shows none of the typical optimism of youth. Silent House turned out to be far darker than I expected. More than once I considered putting the book down without finishing it. I’m glad I didn’t yield to my discomfort. That’s part of the point of this novel.","May 05, 2016"
1927524,Nick,"""Silent House"" is an early novel by Nobel recipient Orhan Pamuk. Compared to his more famous work, it is more straightforward than ""My Name is Red"", which harnesses its setting in early Ottoman Istanbul and its self-conscious virtuosity to a mystery that rarely seems to be the novelist's focus. ""Silent House"" shares the historical setting of ""The Museum of Innocence"", the politically-riven Turkey of the eighties. Nationalism is on the rise, and an Army coup is around the corner. But unlike ""The Museum of Innocence"", ""Silent House"" is not narrated by a single obsessive voice, which gives the later novel an often claustrophobic atmosphere. It actually does not take place in Istanbul but instead in a small beach community on the Bosphorus to which the patriarch of the family had retreated after political disappointment to write the encyclopedia that he believes would change Turkey. By the time of the novel, he is long dead and his writing long destroyed, although he is still vivid in the memories of his ninety-year old widow. The other narrators are his progeny--from the widow, two grandchildren: the failed historian Faruk and the youthful Metin, the latter envious of the wealthier and smoother children of the elite who he tries to match in sophistication, with disastrous results. Then there are Recep, the patriarch's son by his mistress, who serves the widow in her decaying house, and Hasan, a grandson who, frustrated and grasping for hope, falls in with the nationalists, trying and failing to impress them. This is, broadly speaking, a battle between those who favored modernizing Turkey--although without Ataturk's skill or vision--and those who insist on trying to recreate an imperial and religion-centered past. But Pamuk does not take sides; his at times scornful, at times sorrowful, criticism is aimed at the delusional patriarch and Meten, whose yearning for money and partying is the fruit of a powerful insecurity over status. In truth, Meten resembles Hasan, which does not prevent him from treating his poorer cousin shamefully; they are young men adrift in a society that is growing more secular and money-driven, both knowing in their hearts that they will be left behind, and both transmuting that anxiety into obsession over an unreachable girl. The widow, more religious than her late husband, spends her time talking back to her dead husband as she never could in life, obsessing over the sins of her living and dead family members, and accusing Recep (who has the fewest discernible flaws of any of the narrators) of various kinds of betrayal. The treatment of Hasan is not unsympathetic with its careful exploration of the frustrations that drive him, but in the end he destroys what he says he loves and flees without conscience. Pamuk's unsparing view of Turkish society of the time finds both nationalism and modernism bankrupt, cloaks that allow the narrators to continue their self-deceptions. Even Recep, the only one who can be said to produce his best efforts, fails. ""Silent House"" also caused me, though, to think back about one issue that bothered me greatly about ""The Museum of Innocence""--the passivity of the female characters. In ""The Museum of Innocence"", the female characters accepted their fate (at least until the conclusion and even then, the woman who is the object of the narrator's destructive obsession acts as though she has no choices). In ""The Silent House"", two women are assaulted. One continues to ride around in a car with her attacker and dismisses the importance of the incident; the other refuses to seek medical attention. That this minimization of violence in ""The Silent House""--and the lack of agency that marks the women in both novels--is likely part of Pamuk's critique of Turkish society. But it does not help his case that we spend so much time understanding men who act childishly and in the end destructively and so little among the injured women.","Jan 09, 2018"
900800,Inderjit Sanghera,"‘Silent House’ by Orhan Pamuk follows multiple individuals who reside in a small town outside of Istanbul; there is the matriarchal grandmother whose narrative constantly interweaves the past with the present, her past forming the crux of her existence. Haunted by the loss of her husband, her obsession with her past causes her to become cantankerous to those round her as she prepares for the coming visit of her grand-children. In a polar opposite to their grand-mother, her grand-children are apprehensive about their futures; Metin with his obsession with emigrating to America, Nilgun and her radical political groups against the backdrop of rising nationalism and Faruk with his work on Ottoman history-burdened with their present, there is an underlying tension in the narrative which is exacerbated by the violent and vituperative Hasan, whose unrequited love for Nilgun drives him further into the nationalistic circles he is slowly becoming ensconced within.. Indeed, especially as the novel is set just prior to the military coup of 1980, the primary focus of the novel is to explore the radical and revolutionary ideas engendered by youth; whether it be writing a historical treatise on the Ottoman Empire, exploring left or right wing politics or an obsession with the West, the characters symbolise different aspects of youth and the varying factors which cause the disparities between different individuals. The narrative constantly jumps between different points of views, with the style often incorporating stream-of-concioussness. Pamuk renders the resort within which the novel is set with a kind of sable beauty; the night-sky merges with the city to form an endless expanse of darkness which is lit up by the stars and the street-light which serve to illuminate the lives of the youths whose hopes and dreams briefly flicker and burn out as the novel reaches it’s tragic conclusion.","May 10, 2018"

An interesting read which reminded me a little bit of Naguib Mahfouz's fiction. Pamuk gives us multiple narrators to tell us the story of Turkey and its 20th century struggles as the border state between Europe and the Muslim nations of the middle east. A pity that I don't know the history of the country, because I believe it would have enhanced my understanding, but still, a well written story of multiple generations and classes trying to adapt to a world that is changing without their consent and without a user manual..

For me, I wanted to hear more about Selahattin, his questionings and clashes and also Recep as well. The first 50 pages were more flowing for me (before the grandchildren got involved) and I found some of their personal stories “uninteresting.”.

But this work lacks the depth with which Pamuk wrote Snow thirty years later with a similar theme. Characters in Snow express opinions to explain which ideology they belong to clearly. But the people of Silent House are just blasphemous to prove their secularity.","Jun 17, 2017"
55219317,Amber,"I always regret waiting so long to read the next Orhan pamuk book on my list! He never disappoints!. This one is an absolute favourite (though nothing beats Museum of Innocence, and Snow) ..... He takes the reader to a tumultuous time in the History of modern Turkey, rich n human bound depiction of the cultural and identity crisis that permeates the nation's minds and souls represented by an obsessive dr working for decades on an encyclopedia that he means to use a tool to awaken his ""sleeping"" compatriots n bring them at par with the West overnight by making them believe in scientific experiments, atheism and Darwinism..... the book covers the histories of 3 generations of the doctor's family (including his illegitimate sons) n goes on to show how the young Turkish boys n girls are haunted by their forefathers' past, the burden of history, cultural traditions and prejudices, money problems and above all a desire to BE ! To make something of themselves in the emerging world of material developments. Hassan and Metin are 2 sides of the same page, one less underprivileged, the other extremely poor, divided by social class these two young men cross paths without ever acknowledging that they both have same blood in their veins n the same strangeness in their minds. Nilgun represents the modern Turkish female student who likes to have opinions and pays a heavy almost heart breaking price for having them. The book leaves the reader with many questions and unfinished answers but then again Can a novelist “trick you with his literary skill” and still produce a work of historical truth?. Or as the grandmother thinks. ""You can’t start out again in life, that’s a carriage ride you only take once, but with a book in your hand, no matter how confusing and perplexing it might be, once you’ve finished it, you can always go back to the beginning; if you like, you can read it through again, in order to figure out what you couldn’t understand before, in order to understand life, isn’t that so, Fatima?""","Nov 02, 2019"

Appreciated maybe - It's a journey into nothingness and futility, anger spite & fear. I felt like I needed a wash afterwards. I found the Grandmother's vicious point of view particularly difficult to read. Almost as bleak as a Cormac McCarthy, but more believable - *shudders*. I read the drunken rage and rape driving scenes with a kind of fascinated horror, needing to put the book down but forced to go on against my will.

210397,jo,"i enjoyed this book tremendously. a few hours from instanbul, in what used to be country-side but is now a posh sea town, an elderly widow lives in a decrepit old house. the book is set in 1980 (though this date is never mentioned in the book; the book was published in 1983) and takes place during the days in which fatma’s grandchildren pay her their annual visit. the eldest is a university professor in history, the second oldest a university student and the youngest a high schooler. the narration is multivocal: the elderly lady, her house servant, two of the three grandchildren, the servant's nephew, also a high schooler, and a friend of one of the grandchildren speak in alternating chapters.. the themes the novel covers are many, and it is a sign of pamuk's genius that he can address them all with effortlessness and without ever sounding pedantic or heavy handed. there is the issue of love -- romantic love -- a very fraught issue in this particular book and, if i remember correctly, in. Snow. (my only other foray into pamuk-land) too -- and familial love. there is the conflict between left-wing (communist) non-believers and muslim fundamentalists, just on the eve of a military coup (the coup is not mentioned, but the tension is high). there is aging. there is family trauma. there are sick and deformed bodies (the servant is a little person, or, in the book's rendition, a dwarf), there is the restlessness of young men, and, last but definitely not least, there is a nice deep take on history and learnedness.. fatma is on a 70-year self-imposed exile in the locality where the book takes place. most of her sections of the book are cynical, crotchety, and angry commentaries on her current conditions, including her grandchildren's visit, and accounts of her married life. her husband selâhattin, now dead, spent his entire life working on a science-based, anti-religious encyclopedia, an enlightenment-flavored project for his fellow asians, who, in his view, are very backwards and nowhere near the intellectual level of europeans. the liminal place of turkey and in particular of instanbul on the border of asia and europe is clearly and centrally thematized. the vicissitudes of the encyclopedia, its author, and the way he chooses to support himself in the process of writing it, are one of the backbones of the story. the immense project leads fatma's husband to insanity. yet fatma remains so beholden to him that she reports faithfully his rants against religion and a theological understanding of the world – the rants go on for paragraphs, and are as irritating (because he rants at her, and is clearly obsessed and increasingly unmoored) as they are interesting. she also feels compelled to remain in the exile to which he brought her (they escape istanbul under circumstances which may well have been the result of selâhattin's self-aggrandizing paranoia). she describes without anger the pillaging of her family’s jewelry selâhattin did in order to keep himself and his wife alive while he worked monomaniacally on his encyclopedia. tragically, and predictably, in spite of the man's assiduous work, the encyclopedia never gets completed.. this intellectual effort is mirrored in grandson faruk, a history professor who is profoundly disillusioned with his job and work. while on holiday at his grandmother's, though, he discovers the local archives and draws new energy and vitality from the idea of writing a book in which he simply lists past events (the documents he finds in the archives are transactional court records from, if i’m not wrong, the 16th century, and deal mostly with daily disputes over small matters) without commentary or a thesis. in a number of chapters he reflects enthusiastically on a vision of history as simple compilation of archival records. this contrasts with but also complements his grandfather's encyclopedic effort. whereas his grandfather (whom faruk never mentions, thus giving us the impression that probably he knows nothing about him) failed massively at his recasting the entirety of knowledge in lay terms, faruk gives up on seeking sense altogether, letting facts speak for themselves, or not speak at all, or speak only through whatever story-telling the reader wants to build with them.. i found this whole part, this struggling with culture, knowledge and history, the most compelling part of the book. in a way, all the characters struggle with meaning-making, some through politics, some through religion, in such a way as to put the positioning of turkish culture in the changing political landscape of the 20th century at the heart of the book.. but i was also fascinated by the depiction of masculinity. both high schoolers are enamored of women who do not reciprocate their love, and, shockingly, they become quite aggressive and violent in their pursuit of these girls. the adult men are either failed intellectuals or abused and disenfranchised cripples (the dwarf and his limping brother).. in the basement of the house lies the big secret of the dwarf and his brother, illegitimate sons of selâhattin and his and fatma's former house-servant. it is essential for fatma to keep the familial bond between the dwarf and the rest of the family secret, and this secret haunts the house and the family, seeding violence, madness, and failure.. fatma’s own brand of insanity includes obsessing over the imperative that this secret be never revealed to the young people -- that the fact that recep, the disabled servant, is their uncle remain forever hidden. but this shame ends up rotting everyone’s lives. i know too little about turkish history and culture to assess whether the secret of recep’s birth stands for some larger national secrets. in the context of the family, though, recep, the only character in the novel beside fatma who knows everything, is the only decent family member, the sole bringer of sanity to a crumbling home.","Jul 28, 2016"
5935491,Tanja Berg,"I was a bit uncertain of the rating for this book. However, I landed on 4* out of 5 mostly because I rather enjoyed it. This despite the fact that the alternating voices, perspectives and even tenses were confusing at times. Most of the voices - there was never any warning - I could quickly and easily tell apart, but the two teenage boys, Metin and Hasan were a bit difficult every now and then. Purposely so, the translator tells me at the end of the book.. Hasan and Metin are related, although they don't know it. They both have the same grandfather, Selâhattin, long dead. He had an affair with the maid and two children by her. One of them, a dwarf, Recep, is now keeping the house for Fatma, Selâhattin's widow. She awaits her three grandchildren who come and stay for a week every year - Metin, Nilgün and Faruk. The setting is the late 1970's in Turkey and the fact that I had absolutely no clue as to the historical aspects hampered my understanding a bit.. I don't think this a great book exactly, but it's oddly endearing in its telling of already broken dreams and dreams about to be broken.. Filed in the reading challeng 2015 in the category ""a book you have thought about reading for a long time"".

6970638,Sheri,"This book is a collection of representations and parallels. Pamuk draws lines between the oppressed and dominant across several groups: women/men; East/West; religious/atheist; poor/rich; educated/superstitious. He writes a series of chapters from each of the character’s perspectives and through these we learn about and sympathize with them individually as well as begin to understand the tapestry that is their world.. Fatma is a great icon for the religious East. As a young girl she married Selahattin and despite his proclamations: “I’m so proud of you, I respect you, you know, I think of you as a free and independent person; I don’t think of you the way others think of their wives, as a concubine, an odalisque, a slave: you’re my equal, my dear, do you understand?” failed to achieve any meaningful relationship with him. She is unable to release herself from her biases and greed. As the keeper of the jewels and the judgmental one, she epitomizes Selahattin’s description of the upper class, cold woman: “Woman is the fulfillment of man…Women can be divided into two groups…The first is natural woman, those who enjoy the pleasures and joys that nature has given to them, relaxed, without problems, without worries, who usually come from the people, from the lower class…The second kind of woman: ill tempered; authoritarian, supposedly refined, who insists on persuading you to accept her preconceived notions, cold women with no empathy”. In the end, she simply stays in her bedroom lamenting the loss of her riches and worrying about her stuff: “I can’t see my things anymore, they’re free of my glances, all silent and unto themselves, they think that even without me they can stay where they are, motionless, but I know you; you’re there, my furniture, you’re there next to me, as though you know I’m here.”. Metin has class concerns and issues; he is not-really part of the upper class of the city. He scrambles to fit in with the upper class in ways similar to Hasan’s struggle to fit in with the nationalists. Pamuk does a great job of showing the similarities between these two boys who are ultimately trying to jump up to the next socio-economic level. Metin’s fantasies about traveling to America and his frustration over Ceylan are remarkably like Hasan’s fantasies about becoming a powerful factory owner and his desire for Nilgun. Of course, the fact that these two are cousins (unbeknownst to them) and both are products of Selahattin’s failings just accentuates the building drama. Metin does have a better grasp on reality even if he is rather melodramatic: “I was becoming increasingly convinced that I was just a no-good lowlife, but at the same time I was feeling pretty good about myself, empty pride being the best antidote for worthlessness, to the point that I wanted to do something to make everyone pay attention to me, though unfortunately I couldn’t find either the courage or the excuse to do anything.”. Recep is the most likable of all the narrators. He is simply lonely, but persevering. He knows his place in the world and rather than wish it were different (as Metin and Hasan), he accepts it and strives to do his best. He has some greatly contradictory (but all true) musings about friendship and his own outcast status. He says: “so there you are; what we call conversation and friendship. We tell each other things that we already know, and it makes me feel good; I know they’re just empty words, but it’s a distraction, at least, and I still get a kick out of it.” But then he also recognizes that “there are times when words can touch people, too, that I know. Somebody says hello, he listens to you tell about your life, then he tells you about his, and you listen to him, and in this way we each see our life through another’s eyes.” And yet, ultimately he just wants acceptance. The most poignantly sad lament I found to be: “When two people across from each other fall silent, that silence sometimes says more than if the two were talking. I sometimes think it would be nice to have a friend I could be silent with.”. The novel’s biggest point, though, has to do with perception. Each of these characters is unable to see the world from outside of their own narcissistic view. Famuk’s obsession with the past is similar to Selahattin’s obsession with knowledge and his encyclopedia, but Famuk has the presence of mind to recognizes that bias is in all things and strives to present a story that is not (his)story. He wants to accurately portray without his own perceptions (don’t we all), but is stifled by his inability to do so. Ironically, it is Metin who best articulates our inability to understand or step outside of ourselves: “this ‘me’ that I was going to tell her about seemed like it never really existed. The thing I called me was like a box within a box; it was like there was always something else inside it, maybe if I kept looking I could finally find my real self and express it, but every new box I opened had, instead of a real, true Metin that I could show to Ceylan, just another box hiding him.”. Overall it was interesting from a cultural and historical standpoint, but not super compelling. It was more of a setting piece (as others have noted on the verge of the political uprising in Turkey) than a character piece; these are more “representational” than real people. And Pamuk leaves us with the (always true) comment that literature can teach us about our own lives: “You can’t start out again in life, that’s a carriage ride you only take once, but with a book in your hand, no matter how confusing and perplexing it might be, once you’ve finished it, you can always go back to the beginning.”","Apr 27, 2014"

1188122,Kara Babcock,"One of the background themes of. The Prisoner of Heaven. was the ongoing conflict between nationalist/fascist and socialist/communist ideologies in Spain in the middle of the twentieth century. History class in Canada focuses on fascism almost exclusively as seen in World War II. It elides over the Spanish Civil War (I’ve had to remedy that on my own time). It mentions Mussolini in passing as a buddy of Hitler’s rather than a fascist dictator in his own right. And everything after World War II is the vague era known as the “Cold War”, with no explanation that, in countries like Turkey, the conflict between communism and fascism was really just beginning.. From this perspective I approach. Silent House. . Set in 1980s Turkey, and also written in that era but only recently translated into English, this book examines the polarized atmosphere of the country through a single family returned to the house of their matriarch. Fatma has outlived her husband, who had delusions of scientific grandeur, and her son. Her grandchildren come now to visit her, and they bring with them the scents and sounds and sights of a modern age. Fatma, who has lived her whole life in this grand house since relocating from Istanbul, does not embrace this change. Ever since the days of listening to her husband rant about the death of God and the rise of Western modernism, Fatma has been fearful of what such change might bring. Yet change is coming to this village.. The. New York Times Book Review. has a blurb on the front cover of my edition, calling this “a microcosm of a country on the verge of a coup”. I am somewhat put out at them, because I would have liked to use. microcosm. to describe this book. But now that would look like copying, wouldn’t it? Because they are right: Orhan Pamuk uses the device of these characters and their interconnected, tangled lives to represent the Turkish state at large. Each character is diverse in their goals, values, and actions. In this way,. Silent House. exemplifies the ability of historical fiction to tell grand tales of history through the lives of small, insignificant figures. One does not need to recount the deeds of generals on battlefields to explain how a country rises and falls.. I confess, however, to struggling with. Silent House. . It offers very little to capture one’s attention. The narration is curiously flat. Each chapter is told from the first-person perspective of a different character, as indicated by the chapter title. Sometimes it’s easy to forget which character is the narrator at the time, though; they sound very similar. And Pamuk tends to include flashbacks in which other characters suddenly start narrating, or engaging in dialogue without quotation marks, that can make it very confusing to follow. This is particularly evident in Fatma’s chapters, where she tends to recall conversations she once had with her husband, who was obsessed with somehow realigning Turkey along scientific principles imported from the West. I can appreciate what Pamuk is trying to do from a technical standpoint, but it leaves me cold.. The other difficulty lies within the characters themselves. There is little to love about them, or even sympathize with. For example, Hasan is supposed to be a classical tragic figure. He is a misguided youth who has fallen in with some hotheaded fascists but also fallen in love with Nilgün, who has communist sympathies. Torn between these loyalties but ultimately too weak to decide for himself, Hasan is carried along on a tide of anger and violence that ends in injury and death. It really is a well-executed character arc—except that I never really felt connected to either Hasan or Nilgün. The latter doesn’t actually get a viewpoint chapter, while the former spends most of his chapters whining about how he doesn’t have enough money and doesn’t want to study.. Overall, this combination of unsympathetic characters and difficult narration creates a scattered impression of the story. I feel like I’m viewing. Silent House. down the wrong end of a telescope: there is something intriguing here, but it didn’t quite work for me. I much preferred. My Name is Red. , which was also difficult to read but had some redeeming qualities in its characterization. What. Silent House. does is reaffirm Pamuk’s abilities as a writer while also hinting that, perhaps, he isn’t quite the writer for me.","Dec 24, 2013"
35482263,Gumble's Yard,"The book is a multi third person narrator novel – all of the characters are a little confused or melancholy. Recep is the bastard son of Fatma’s wife with a crippled brother – it seems she beat them both as children which lead to both of their disabilities. Fatma spends a long time brooding on her dead husband’s iniquities to her (he in turn we learn never really recovered from the Attaturk reform of the alphabet, rendering most of his work to date useless, the supposedly moderniser being caught out by modern reforms) and on the disappointment that her son followed a similar political path. Father, son and grandson Faruk all share the same defeated character and revert to drink and to study to try and shut out the world.. Presciently for a book written in the early 1980s, Hasan is an archetype of a Islamic terrorist in the making, fired up by religion and national pride in his head, but in practice largely fired up by the humiliation he feels both around the privileged and around women (Nilgrun being both) and vowing that one day he will carry out an act that will shake the world.. The book is only Pamuk’s second and reads like it – many of the ideas around the clashing identities of Turkey which are in Snow clearly have their genesis here but are not fully realised.","Jan 14, 2017"

(The concordance of this notion with Indians' notions of India is the reason why Pamuk sells a lot here.). Patchily done. Almost juvenile at times in its experimental vigour, although extracting, in some places, traces of a genius that Pamuk would later come to wield at will.. The heart of Pamuk's best novels - the return of the exiled man, or a man's quest / search for a woman, or both of these together, as in Snow and My Name is Red - is missing here. The problem is that none of the characters are vying for normative happiness (the tangible, non-fantastical variety), one that Pamuk romanticizes so beautifully in later novels, one that his best characters are willing to - contradictorily, of course - risk their lives for.. Pamuk's seems to be struggling in trying to find the balance between writing a psychological novel and a political novel. He has still not figured how both can be done simultaneously.","Jan 23, 2014"
2420967,Marla,"I need to start my own personal campaign to get a ""couldn't finish it"" rating. I feel I'm being misleading by giving a book a rating I didn't finish. I especially feel guilty when the author is Orhan Pamuk. He's so well respected...he's won the Nobel Prize, Norman Mailer Award...on and on. I REALLY wanted to like this. I will say this is the only book of his I've ever read. And, it's one of his very early works, newly translated into English for the first time.. That being said, I gave it 100 pages. It's a story about 3 grandchildren coming to visit their grandmother who lives with her husband's illegitimate son as her caregiver (everything you can imagine about this bizarre relationship is true). Set in Turkey, the late 70's, the story is appealing enough (albeit slow moving) and the characters are interesting. There's the elderly curmudgeon grandma, the alcoholic historian grandson, the two younger ones that are kind of shiftless, no regard for tradition...dreams of coming to America, patronizing grandma etc...there's plenty of 1970's politics also. The story is told from the viewpoints of the characters, in alternating chapters.. The grandmother's voice (chapters) was maddening. There was not one period in a whole chapter, literally a 10 page sentence. This made it difficult to read. What I assumed, since she was hanging on to reality by a thread in her old age, that Pamuk wanted to convey the chaos going on in her brain. I understood that. What it did for me, was irritate the hell out of me and tempted me to skip (and skim) her chapters (big mistake, because she's a central character). I had no clue what she was saying the majority of the time, rereading and rereading. It took considerable effort to get as far as I did.. I really try not to read reader reviews before I read a book. I don't like being influenced one way or the other. Still, some influence is bound to occur just from reading the jacket etc...I wondered why this book was never translated into English before now. I may have found the answer. I'm not giving up on Pamuk. I'll try one of his better known works and chalk this one up as a first novel.","Aug 05, 2013"
1207684,Bruce,"This novel was Orhan Pamuk’s second, written and originally published in 1983, but it was much more recently finally translated into English. The story involves an extended family living a short distance from Istanbul where the now deceased grandfather was “exiled” for political reasons. The time of the narrative is in the late 1970’s, shortly before a period of political rebellion, and tension is in the air. The events described occur during one week when the aged grandmother’s grandchildren, two boys and a girl, come for their annual visit. The tone of the narrative is one of unrelieved bleakness and disappointment, each character feeling frustrated by his or her circumstances and each living in a world of dreams toward which no real efforts are being made toward realization. The society depicted is one of relative impoverishment, violence, and bursts of immediate gratification, all characters apparently caught in a web of futility.. Like his much later novel,. My Name is Red. , a more skillful and fully realized work, Pamuk alternates chapters focusing on one major character and then another, all told in the first person, moving quickly back and forth from one perspective to another. The transitions in this early novel are not as smooth and seamless as in the later one, but the parallels are clear. Pamuk is masterful in his ability to bring alive a time and place, circumstances and an ambiance, and he provides a view into the lives, aspirations, and foiled ambitions of his characters during a difficult period in Turkish history. I am glad that I read this work that provides a view into not only a country and culture but also into Pamuk’s own development as a novelist.","Apr 04, 2016"
1457001,Stephen Durrant,"Orhan Pamuk's novels hold particular value for those of who read international fiction in part as a way to gain some sense of the forces shaping other regions of the world. His work invariably portrays the tensions and insecurities of modern Turkey, a country caught, as he repeatedly demonstrates, between two worlds: Europe and the Middle East. ""Silent House,"" one of Pamuk's earlier works, is no exception. This is the story of a large family, spanning three generations and is told with alternating first-person narrators so that we get the vision of various members of the family. Holding the family together, if we can fairly say it is ""held together"" at all, is a ninetyish, conservative grandmother who remains haunted by her deceased husband's blasphemous ""modern"" views, which included an aggressive denial of God's existence. Her posterity and members of the extended family reflect a variety of modern forces: a historian grandson tries to find meaning in history, but rather unsuccessfully; a granddaughter turns to Communism; another playboy grandson dreams of life in America. Perhaps most significant of all, a distant relative, Hasan, is caught up in Turkish nationalism and dreams of a renewal of Ottoman-like power. The novel traces the interaction between these characters, and hence the forces they represent. While the story told here did not enthrall me by any means, I came away feeling rewarded by Pamuk's always insightful depiction of his fascinating homeland.","Oct 26, 2013"
5861086,Margaret Sankey,"An early work by Pamuk, this is Turkey on the brink of the 1980 army coup encapsulated in one listless family. In a distant suburb of Istanbul, 90 year old grandma Fatma waits in a crumbling old house, surrounded by modern development of a resort town. Her arranged husband was an idealistic doctor exiled for challenging in Sultanate government, who then moldered within reach of the capitol through vast reforms, squandering his youth and her money on a ridiculous encyclopedia project and alcohol. The son was a middling civil servant, the grand children underemployed, idealistic flakes and depressed. A bastard branch of the family, represented by the dwarf houseman and his right-wing thug nephew, have gone in an equally useless direction until events cause them all to cross paths in the worst possible way. In Turkish, this is an excellent translation exercise, since every chapter is first person narration from a different character, and told in their diction and slang--the grandmother's laboring 19th century grammar, the thug's short expletives. Although not as polished as his later books, this is family as metaphor for the whole state.","Jan 09, 2013"
1618357,Jay,"Is Istanbul a suburb of Atlanta? I was expecting a book about Turkey by a Turkish author to make me feel like I'm in that foreign country, but this book felt like a Flannery O'Connor novel, with a bunch of characters that just weren't that nice, some oddities (people, situations), and a sense of time and of buildings and people getting run down. I was waiting for someone to slip and call the grandmother's house a plantation. Not so interesting - just couldn't care about the people, but you got the idea that there were some threads of stories that could be interesting if the author wanted them to be.","Apr 02, 2013"
18705909,Deepa Nair,"The whole thing turned out to be a damp squib. Not sure if it has something to do with the never-ending prose or the translation.. All along, the political situation in the 1980's Turkey has been deftly projected through the microcosm of the silent house and the impending coup has been presciently chronicled. As expected, the all-pervasive inkling of despondency was along the same lines as in Pamuk's 'Istanbul'. Noticeably, the oddity of the male characters was conspicuous, be it the nonconformist Selhatten, the disfigured dwarf or Faruk and Metin with a somewhat warped frame of mind. Metin's American dreams and Selhattin's praise songs raving about the West conforms to the aura of veneration of the West in a country straddling the East and West.. From the novel itself, sadly, it occurred to me that the rich heritage and culture of the east had been relegated to the archives that Faruk was trying to pore over painstakingly. Interestingly, the medieval patriarchal disposition was all too evident more so in the adolescent deportment. The storyline makes it clear to the reader, how politically charged the atmosphere in Turkey was then and the undertones and undercurrents of a coup d etat in the offing loomed large in the horizon right through. Of the two prominent female characters, Nilgun seemed level-headed, Fatma was loathsome, conceivably inured to her not so pleasant family life with all its discordance and ineluctable subservience to an unhinged husband that had understandably desensitized her. Juxtaposed with the male characters, they seemed mediocre and brookable. In a nutshell, apart from the farsightedness, Pamuk has shown in the plot, the evolution of the storyboard seemed a bit disappointing.","Mar 17, 2017"

5912889,Catherine Woodman,"This book is an old one that has been newly translated into English. Orhan Pamuk has now won the Nobel Prize in Literature, and so all his work can be translated into English. When I was first in Turkey in 2006, I read his travelogue about Istanbul and not very presciently predicted he would win the Nobel Prize—he is very clearly that good. He has always reminded me of Marcel Proust in the level of attention to detail that he gives to everything that surrounds each of his characters.. This book takes place against the backdrop of a military coup that took place in Turkey in 1980 (the book was published originally in 1983). This history feels strongly present in the novel's governing metaphors of tradition, transition and inter-generational tension. A family reunion is taking place in a fishing village near Istanbul, where Fatma, the 90-year-old widow of a local doctor, is receiving a ritual summer visit from her three grandchildren. The book is alternatively narrated by her, her children, and her servants.. One of Fatma's grandsons, Faruk, is following his father and grandfather in working on a manuscript which will seek to explain Turkey and the universe. The late doctor's project was an encyclopedia of everything, reminiscent of Mr Casaubon's in Middlemarch (ie. not likely to be completed—all work and no organization), although the Turkish physician was seeking to disprove the existence of God. Faruk seems far more functional than that. Other cultural tensions within the country are represented-- granddaughter Niljun, a leftist activist who buys the communist daily paper and mesmerizes the men around her with her beauty, would choose to live in the Soviet sector, while grandson Metin would take the mandate of the Georgian peanut farmer. Metin wants to leave Turkey for America and sees no reason why his grandmother shouldn’t sell her dilapidated but highly valued home and bankroll his dreams. The other narrators in the story are a dwarf who cares for Fatma and his son, Hasan, who is a fundamentalist Muslim who is the center of the tragic chapter that the story builds to. The book is sorrowful in tone from front to back, but it is a well told tale that reflects an interesting culture and country.","Jan 10, 2013"
1303105,Kireja,"http://www.academia.edu/5031018/_Orha.... This book ""is set in the economic turmoil and social violence before the 1980 coup, as three grandchildren visit their aging grandmother in her decaying Ottoman mansion"". This book is the first book I read by Orhan Pamuk, so it took some time getting adjusted to his writing style and his use of stream of consciousness in the novel (some sections of the novel were difficult to follow as a result).. Orhan Pamuk was noted as saying that a revolution ""does not quell a family's issues; it only magnifies them"". This is indeed the case in this book where a family's issues are set on a parallel course with a country's issues. The book shifts between five characters who are all very different from one another; this shift between stories presents us with key issues such as past versus present/future, East versus West, Modernity versus traditionalism and liberal/progressive political and religious views versus a more traditional religious/political viewpoint.. I was also interested in the inspiration behind this novel and I learned that parts of the novel were based on Pamuk's life and of course the political history of Turkey. In fact the author describes in his memoir the ""early happiness and security he felt among his large family, its branches spread across the diﬀerent ﬂoors. He regularly visited his educated grandmother in her bed on the top ﬂoor."" Thus his grandmother was the inspiration for the character Fatma. Correspondence between his grandparents also became the inspiration for the relationship between Fatma and her husband Selahattin: ""Pamuk's grandfather had written to his wife ""of the progress of the women’s movement, which she ﬂatly replied was a sin and forbidden"".","Oct 09, 2013"
14690148,Annette,"I found this book set in Turkey, not far from Istanbul compelling and gut wrenching: obsession of men with task, rather than relationship; the repetition of one generation to the next to emulate failings and learn little from example; the nascent presence of the idea of the dominant Islamic state; the concept and meaning of death; the isolation of the elderly; the inherent sexual drive of teenagers; the thanklessness of some lives; the value of the written word, but only within a context; the search for the meaning of life, and the ability of men to justify bad behaviour and weakness by precedent; the withdrawal of women from their natural instinct for communication. The book is wonderfully crafted as chapters in turn are given voice by the key characters, with their thoughts and observations interrupted by conversation with others. Not a happy book, but I think a powerful one still relevant today, or maybe even more so than it was when written 30 years ago","Jan 01, 2015"
819818,Ferris,"This novel, although translated and released in English in 2012, was actually one of Pamuk's early works, originally published in 1983. It was interesting to read this early novel now, after having read almost all of his later works. There are glimmers of the masterful writer in this story, but it is nowhere near the eloquent, finely crafted quality of his current writing. Clearly, even from his earliest writing, Pamuk attempts to blend literary and political elements to convey through fiction, the political, social climate in Turkey at the time of significant events. I am just happy to have read his later, magnificent works. He is one of my all-time favorite authors!","Jan 18, 2013"

46675920,Atharv G.,"I very much enjoyed this look at 1980s Turkey. There was so much content to sink my teeth into - from westernization/secularization, religion, nationalism vs. liberalism, generational differences, etc. And it felt like Pamuk handled each of these subjects very thoughtfully and considerately. All of the characters are unlikeable but that doesn't mean they aren't fascinating people to read about. Each of them felt so well drawn and each of the perspectives had such different voices as well. I also liked how Pamuk would often blur time by interrupting a character's thinking about their past with dialogue from the present. One complaint I had was that these inner monologues sometimes felt too long, which made the book slow going at times. Also, I first started reading this book in 2017, but I was put off by what I perceived as a poor translation and didn't pick it back up until last December. While this translation didn't annoy me as much when I picked it up again, I do think the translation is inconsistent in its strengths. The writing style very skillfully depicts a character's thought process, but its descriptions of character's actions felt much plainer and more basic. Of course, I cannot pinpoint whether this is a problem of the translation or with Pamuk's writing style (this is one of his earliest novels as well), but it didn't bother me quite as much this time.. Overall, this book was a very thought-provoking snapshot of a moment in Turkish history and has made me really excited to pick up more Pamuk.","Jan 16, 2019"

183639,Irwan,"I have quite a high expectation with this book, you know that, Mr Pamuk? He stops walking and looks away from the newspaper he has been perusing. You know, it has been a long time since you gave me a good reading experience. As if it is his obligation to me. Since that innocent book about a guy who was madly in love and created a museum. His blank look is a bit skewed hearing my description of his beloved book. I think you went mad as well by building your own museum and shamelessly publishing a book about that, which by the way is now waiting on my desk. He smiles strangely as if annoyed saying, What are you trying to say,ehm,..Mr. Reader? Well, you have been too busy with that museum nonsense that you forget your duty as a novelist: to write! For a split second I realize what I have been blurting out to my favorite author, oddly I cannot stop, Finally this Silent House book is here for me to read, How snobbish I sound the word ‘finally’, like somebody picking up a due loan, just like the habit of his socialite characters, like Faruk the failed historian, Nilgün the young girl aspired to Communism, and Metin the youngest of the siblings who wants to escape Turkey, to America. To be somebody. These three people are the grandchildren of Selahettin, another mad character you wrote, Mr. Pamuk! He is a Turk who wants to be a Westerner, declares the nonexistence of God. Fatma, his wife, when he was still alive, used to listen to his ravings about bootstrapping the Turkish society to be able to catch up with the West. Fatma always listens silently, hence the Silent House!, you see how smart I am to guess your little riddle there, Mr.Pamuk, while actually she is terrified with the sin that the husband commits. Not only that, Selahettin, without Fatma’s knowledge, could find time between his insane writing of volumes of encyclopaedia, which will enlighten the backward Turkey still overwhelmed by its Ottoman past glory, to have an affair with the housemaid, resulting in two children: Recep who is a dwarf and Ismael who ends up living as a cripple, not by birth, but by Fatma’s one moment of rage in which she realized how she could no longer live with the sins her husbands had committed. Are you confused yet, Mr. Pamuk? He still looks attentively and silently. Of course you are not confused, it is your craft to create such a dense stream of zig zag long sentences, attacking sloppy readers from every directions, crying for a complete attention. See how demanding you are, Mr. Pamuk? He only smiles. Rather cheekily. And says nothing. And you took a slice of time and space, less than a week, in the ancient house Selahettin built, where Fatma has been living all this time, now as a widow, served by Recep the dwarf now 53 years old. The three grandchildren is paying a regular visit. A rather reluctant reunion. Each brings their own aspiration, which you show us nakedly in turn, Mr. Pamuk. Aspiration of young secular Turks in the middle of he tension with the traditional past. Then there is Hasan, the son of Ismael, the illegitimate sibling of the three. He has joined the Nationalist movements, aspiring to the traditional, Muslim, Ottoman values. Partly by peer pressure, partly by frustration of a young man with dreams which seem impossible in his current place in the society. You cleverly portrayed this tension and captured the gist of time, which is almost thirty years ago, almost twenty years before this kind of tension erupted in the global scale igniting the age of terrorism, right, Mr. Pamuk? Oh, now you just sound like a pseudo intellect literary critic, with your fancy smancy words. He seems to loose interest in my talk and walks away. But he turns around abruptly, How dare you trying to emulate my writing style in such a cheap way! Get more practice!","Oct 06, 2012"
73582588,Nigel Walker,"As you would expect from a Nobel winner a well written book which links a complex family with the complex political situation in Turkey around the late 1970's. I found that the complexity of the family meant that the narrative was rather strained for the first part of the book as we were introduced to each person through there own voice (a nice touch). The latter part of the book dealt with the consequences and moved at a different pace. Pamuk still had to fully find his feet in this, his second book, but was well on his way.","Feb 17, 2018"
1758411,Lisa,"Silent House is the first of the books nominated for the 2012 Man Asian Literary Prize that I’ve read, but I would have read it anyway. I have yet to read My Name is Red which won the IMPAC Prize in 2003 so it was Snow that was my introduction to Pamuk and I was fascinated by the way his characters were trapped in a dichotomy between Islamism and modernism and could not opt out of making a choice. The Museum of Innocence is an intriguing story of obsession which uses the trappings of a failed relationship to show how Turkey is caught between east and west. (See my review). Orhan Pamuk is on my list of favourite authors.. Pamuk won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006 and his body of work is cited as a ‘quest for the melancholic soul of his native city [with] new symbols for the clash and interlacing of cultures.’ Silent House is his second novel which although first published in 1983 has only just become available in English translation. (What took so long?) It is a fascinating story which uses the device of a family reunion to exemplify the conflict between Western and Eastern values in Turkey and their yearning for a distinctive identity which is also modern. Turkey’s geography places them on the border of Europe and Asia but it is not dynamic Asia which beckons. The political battle for Turkey’s soul is between the Middle East and Europe, between religious tradition and the secularism which modernised Turkey under the dynamic leadership of Kemal Atatürk. (The irony of this novel being nominated for the Man Asia Literary Prize when Turkey is actively campaigning to join the European Union won’t have been lost on anyone who knows Orhan Pamuk’s body of work).. The cover of the Australian edition shows the fate which secular Turks fear: shabby old houses, the ruins of a citadel representing lost glories, a prominent mosque, and a lonely woman in a headscarf plodding along with no apparent purpose. This is what the long-dead Selâhattin rages against in the novel, and it is the life his widow Fatma lives and does not want to change.. There are multiple narrators in Silent House and Selâhattin though long-dead is the most eloquent of them all. We know his voice because Fatma, now in her nineties, is still replaying their arguments in her memory. He was a rude, opinionated man who drank too much and having had to flee Istanbul because of his political ambitions, spent his time writing a derivative encyclopedia designed to replace religion with science and enable Turkey to belatedly join the modern world. His rejection of the existence of God appalls Fatma, and she refuses to be dragged into his sin.. But hide as she might in her room, Fatma cannot escape the intrusions of the modern world..

37111646,Emre Bolcakan,"I was introduced to Orhan Pamuk through his novel Beyaz Kale. After 2 years without reading any of his novels I was again drawn into his writing thanks to Sessiz Ev. Now that I've finished the novel I contemplate about the meaning of the novel's title ""Silent House"". Orhan Pamuk opens the door to a not so silent house through the narration of a dwarf called Recep. It positively reminded me of Game of Thrones' Tyrion Lannister and I found myself unable to hold back a grin. However the book didn't leave me much time to be simply amused by an insignificant coincidence. With the shifting narration that added depth and the Stream of Consciousness that made me question and deplore both the book and myself, I can say that I was astounded by this novel.. In a one week holiday within the Silent House we enter the viewpoints of 5 different characters. What I appreciated about the shifting viewpoints in this novel is not simply having 5 different states of mind, but to also help intertwine all of these views. In the Silent House a lonely cry cannot be heard yet when these voices elope, the Silent House bursts out in harmony. The viewpoints show how each characters lives can coincide with each other. Whether it be the characters one week together or the recollections of their pasts, with the shifting viewpoints all of these become strands like an intricately woven web. That web is the novel called Sessiz Ev.. When I think more about the meaning behind silent house I'm amazed at how this web can stay tied with the strong individual strands that demand their own existence. Each characters mind adorns the pages of the novel with their stream of consciousness. I commend Orhan Pamuk for drawing out the most raw desires and weaknesses of the characters in such a coherent way. These characters personal digressions from the story are digressions into reality. They have our desires and our weaknesses. The strongest feeling I could relate was the feeling of not belonging. Each character experiences this differently through their unique strengths and flaws yet they all dream of being someone else. That is the silent house. Within the dissonant cacophony of the house lies a silent longing in each of the characters. The true story is how they deal with being someone they cannot except and how they hide that from each other. That is why no matter how much they deviate from each other, longing connects these lone strands within the corner of the Silent House.","Nov 20, 2014"
4555253,Sachin Suresh,"A tender but evocative portrait of a family bound by fate and personality traits.. Fatma is the enduring axis of her family and revolving around her are the lives of three generations of her kith and kin. However her own life is lost in her observations, paranoid ruminations and disenchantment. Generally, like everyone else in the story, Fatma is also a passive recipient of the result of circumstance. She has only occasionally taken reactionary action to get what she wants. Usually she just spends her time mulling sleeplessly about the ruthless outcomes of her being in the company of undesirable relatives.. Nevertheless, while she is the disenfranchised observer of her family the rest of the family members suffer through their own lives. Her husband and one grandson is tortured by the hereditary need to obsessively and critically document the Turkish nature; while her son and another grandson are unnecessarily disillusioned and regretful. Everyone seems to be lying their lives to waste for nothing.. Ironically while Fatma is the victim of this self destructive genealogy of her husband, her companion is her husband's bastard son, Recep. She detests Recep to the point that she had herself beaten him into dwarfism. And while Fatma's family suffers from self-destruction, Recep's is a victim of hereditary servitude towards them.. In this story, one generation can never claim that their circumstances are the result of the actions and inaction of their previous generation. Nobody realizes how identical they are to their parents and grandparents, since one generation dies off well before passing on their character traits by cohabitation. Moreover those who survive are silent. Behavior patterns thus get passed on purely through genes in this story.. The current generation, which comprises of Fatma's three grandchildren and one bastard grandson, have unknowingly inherited a life created by their previous generations. This youngest generation never understands that they are the victims of fate. Half-siblings are thus affected by inherited personalities as well as inherited socio-economic burdens. Only Fatma and her hated servant Recep, are aware of the threads of fate.. Human vanity rarely gives Fate the credit that it deserves.. I have never been so deeply affected by simple language and common phrases which are able to profoundly describe human nature and circumstance.","May 27, 2017"
27482323,Omar Taufik,"This was the second novel I read by our author Orhan Pamuk.. This novel is based in the town of Cennethisar outside Istanbul during the summer of the year 1980 a few months before the 1980 military coup in Turkey.. The "" Silent "" house is the house the 90 year old grandmother Fatma living there with her dwarf servant Recep. She has been living in this house since 1910 when she moved there with her late husband Dr. Selahattin from istanbul after his political issue with Talat Paşa the famous unionist in the Young Türk period of the late Ottoman Empire.. The story tells us about the family reunion that year which she has annualy with her grandchildren coming from Istanbul ( Faruk - Nilgün - Metin ). The author writes the novel in the shape of an inner dialogue narrated in each chapter by one of the 5 main characters ; Fatma - Recep - Faruk - Hasan - Metin.. Hasan who is a main player in the novel with his uncle Recep and Fatma with her grandchildren is a member in right wing nationalist group which was common during the turbulent 1970s Turkey.. The author through this house and characters explores the various diverse differences in the Turkish society during the period going back to the roots of the establishment of the Turkish Republic with collapse of the Ottoman Empire.. In the novel he picture the vast contradiction between old & new , East & West, right & left.. It shows the struggle between love & political idealogy, between religious tradition and western inspired reason.. The character narration that really caught me was the narration and memories of the grandmother Fatma especially her memories of her late husband Dr. Selahattin.. The narration of the dwarf servant Recep is also touching in many human aspects.. The novel has many other touching and interesting aspects which I must leave to the reader of this novel to enjoy.. I also must note that this novel contains some names from the author's previous novel "" cevdet bey & his sons "" which can be realized when reading Fatma's memories of her childhood in Istanbul.. Finally I would like to state that author was drawing the Republic of Turkey with it's complicated history in this "" Silent House "" and novel.. I thank our great author Orhan Pamuk again and again for his great works and books.","Oct 09, 2014"
39860815,Valtteri,"Gets a little tedious at points, especially when Faruk makes his ventures into the history of Turkey but even those parts showcases the mania that runs in the family as curse; the grandfather Selâhattin spent his life drinking and trying to assemble an encyclopedia that would challenge the deeply rooted Eastern values and Faruk's father Dogan tried uselessly turn Turkey a better place through politics. Failed approaches to the enlightenment that could change the country reflect on Turkey's eventful and dark history - the tension that electrifies the whole novel runs through the stories of Metin and Hasan, one dreaming of America and spending his time with richer youngsters and other running with nationalists, trying to prove that he is destined to something great, that anticipate the upcoming military coup. Housekeeper Recep, little person, becomes the embodiment of everyday with his insecurities (everyone in the novel suffers from insecurities) whereas old, 90-year old grandmother Fatma, stuck in her room, becomes the embodiment of suspicion and alienation. Narrative highlights definitely include the family's trip to graveyard and Metin's drunken night, both taking the best use of stream of consciousness in the book. The title springs from the fact that most of the novel's noise takes place in everyone's head; feelings are rarely discussed and they lead to desperation and self-pitying that explodes in the tragic ending. The house itself seems to be full of memories that are never talked through and now it feels as if it is just waiting for the old grandmother's death, its own end. Actually the whole novel is more or less about waiting, we are stuck at this strong but oppressive crossroads, every character is adolescent, even the old grandmother who at the end of the novel (which could be about her death) returns to the exciting memories of her childhood after spending most of her time reflecting on the relationship between her and her husband. It is as if we are waiting for some kind of redemption that never arrives, at the end we as lost as we were in the beginning.","Jul 09, 2017"
1301425,Haarika,"Orhan Pamuk the name itself is an institution for writing. Though Turkish is his medium of writing the translations are one of the best books. Unfortunately, I can not say the same about The Silent House.. Storyline is simple. Set in Turkey during the brink of its modernization tells the stories of Fatma, her grand Children and her husbands illegitimate son / head servant of the house. The conflict of orthodox Fatma and her science worshipping modern husband, Herbitter sweet relationship towards his illegitimate child and her grand children forms the crux of the story. This story is interspersed by Turkeys political journey.. I can associate Pamuk's Turkey on so many levels. Orthodox society on brink of opening its doors to the New. Younger generation miles ahead of the old. Old still trying to cope up with new ideas and young too eager to break the bonds of old. A problem most of the developing countries today face, Especiallyy South Asian communities such as India, China and so forth. They were and they are turbulent times indeed. Characters are lively, it almost seems they speak to you when they narrate their story. We can empathize with them, they are so contradicting that they play with your head. Every time POV character changes my view of story changes with it. Characters almost wage a war against each other with the stories to prove one is better over other.. Pamuk does paint a picture in your head, which is what good fiction should do, but the prose itself is too hard to read for me. This is because the sentences are so complex! Long sentences almost extending a page or more is way too much for me to read at once, grasping and understanding does require more than one reading. Skimming through the book is not definitely the path you take to read it. The prose would have made sense in Turkish I am sure, but utterly lost when its got translated in English. One could see this was done to explain the madness of grandmother's character but others in the story sing in the same cacophonic sounds as her.","Sep 20, 2013"
4597094,Juli Rahel,"I got this book through NetGalley because I had always wanted to read something by Pamuk. I don't have time for a very long review so I'm going to do this quickly.. The novel is structured quite interestingly. Every chapter is narrated by one of the 5 main characters' perspective, which means that you always get a different view of the story. My favourite was probably Recep, who starts of narrating the novel. Pamuk represented his loneliness quite well and I like his stream of consciousness. In the opening chapter, Recep sits in a bar and I found the situation described very realistically. Often scenes in novels are realistic but still maintain this ""fictional"" aspect. These seemed very lifelike. The same counted for Fatma Hanim, who narrates second. I loved her descriptions in the second chapter of wandering through her house, thinking about how none of it would change if no one ever touched it.. As I already said above, Pamuk's writing style is very realistic. I did some research after finishing the novel and he said that most of the details in this novel, the stories, the settings, were from his childhood. The characters are his childhood friends or family members. I think it makes a lot more sense that when an author writes from memory. He is more likely to write, perhaps romantically. These are memories he writes from so they are both realistic, but also there always seems to be a positive twist to them. I also really liked how Pamuk presented Turkey's 'struggle' by introducing Hassan. Although he is in love with a girl, his beliefs, and hers, are more important.. I really like Pamuk's writing style. Because they all are interior monologues, written in stream of consciousness, the reading is much easier than I feared. I loved learning more about Turkey and its history because it is one of those countries I don't know a lot about. I realize this review hasn't exactly been extensive, but I highly recommend the novel to anyone.","Feb 08, 2015"
4693,Ali,"Pamuk’s apprehension, from his early works, is the passage of Turkey, from Ottoman Empire to modernity. All over his works, nationalists and idealists (leftist or rightist) of two, and sometimes three generations, are insisting on their giddy and deceivable perspective of a better society. In such a perplexity between the old and the new, all parts are accusing each other (The others) for being responsible for the failure; the story of the long run delivery of The Middle East.. The Silent House (1983), is the story of a week in which 3 siblings come to a ritual summer visit of their grandmother, who lives in an old, big, family traditional house, just one month before the military coup of Sep. 12 (1980) in Turkey. From a different narrator's point of view in the first person (all characters speak the same monotonique langage), Pamuk relate the encounter of the grandchildren; historian Faruk, Nilgun, a student of sociology, and Metin, a high school student who dreams of making a fortune in America, their grandmother (90 y.o. widow), who remembers her husband Dr. Selahattin Bey, a man who dedicated his life to working on a massive encyclopedia that he claimed would make the people free of “a foolish belief in God” (idealizing Diderot and The Encyclopedia, 1750’s), also some other characters; such as Recep, a dwarf house servant, his brother Ismail, a cripple selling lottery tickets, both bastards of Dr. Salahattin and his unlawful relation with his maid, and Ismail’s son, Hasan, a right-wing prophetic historical shiver.. Diverse from Pamuk's later novels (“My Name is Red”, “Snow”) which address a global readership, The Silent House is a novel for Turkish readers, while all leading to the questions about Turkey’s awkward straddle between despotism and democracy.","Nov 04, 2014"
6348232,Jason,"I don't get it. I get the book - well, I think I do - but I don't get why Orhan Pamuk is a big deal. This is the second book of his I've tried (I tried My Name is Red a few years ago and just couldn't get into it) and the first one I've successfully completed. There are two basic problems in this that made the book like sludging through a sticky, nasty mess for me:. 1) Pamuk's books feel really, really self-aware to me - like at any point someone's going to break through and say directly to the reader, ""HI WE'RE IN A BOOK."" There were a few examples of this in this - such as Nilgun referencing Dickens, all the while the book being about an angry lady living alone constantly living in the past (hmm wonder where I've seen that before) - but the one that sticks in my mind is right at the end. Without giving away too much, it's basically a way for the author to say, ""Boy, you thought you were smart, but I'll bet you didn't catch everything, so you should read it all over again."". 2) The characters are really just not interesting. I would think that having the opportunity to read internal monologues that were a chapter long would give me some empathy with the characters. The only one that I felt anything towards at all was the servant - the rest were entirely self-absorbed and seemed to delight in making each other as miserable as possible. It's not like they had deep-seated drives for this that I could relate to: one was writing a book dedicated to telling everyone that God didn't exist, one wanted to make as much money as he could and move to America, one wanted to drink as much as possible, all the while writing a book. They don't feel like real enough people to take seriously, and they don't seem delicate enough to be seen as totems of deeper symbolic meaning. Meh.","Nov 07, 2016"
4106933,Mark Staniforth,"Orhan Pamuk’s Silent House, translated into English for the first time this year having originally been published in Turkey almost thirty years ago, is, in my opinion, a novel to admire rather than love.. Pamuk’s literary greatness can hardly be over-stated: he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2006, and is considered a giant both in his native land and beyond. Hand in hand with such plaudits, I suppose, comes the expectation of a weighty, complicated read.. ‘Silent House’ is the story of a family drawn together in a crumbling mansion in a fishing village turned fledgling holiday resort. It is the late 1970s, the fascists and communists are spilling blood and the 1980 military coup is imminent. It’s a fascinating time, and the east-west struggle at the heart of the argument is clearly ripe for novel writing: see Izzet Celasin’s brilliant Black Sky, Black Sea, also published this year.. Pamuk’s novel centres around a practically bed-ridden ninety-year-old widow, Fatma, her idealistic doctor husband long gone; her servant Recep, a dwarf and the doctor’s illegitimate son; and her grandchildren who have undertaken an annual summer visit they clearly view as something of a burden. Each of them, along with Recep’s nephew Hasan, combine to present a microcosm of the country at the time: Faruk, a failed historian and borderline alcoholic; Nilgun, whose sympathies lie with the left; the materialistic Metin; and Hasan, increasingly lured to the nationalist cause..

48807617,Athul Domichen,"Normally what I do is read a book, wait for a couple of days, reflect on the book, and write my thoughts. This time, it's not that. I just finished reading Silent House. Pamuk weaves his magic of stories into my life yet again (not that I have read many of his works, just two, including this). Silent House claims nothing profound in its plot or but remains profound as it unravels the lives of the characters who narrate their own life and experiences. Every person is different in life and life is equally different for everyone. Our choices maketh what we are and we are all closely linked to each other, every human being, in thoughts and deeds- what affects you can affect me as well, some way or the other. All characters in the novel, Grandma (Fatma), Recep, Faruk, Hasan, Nilgun, Metin - all of them have lives knit close to each other and all of them bears crosses of their own. The book shows a clash of ideologies, religion, personal conflicts, love, lust, meaninglessness of life events, lack of empathy and understanding, fraud, and much more to us. Somehow, Recep the dwarf had always had the form of Peter Dinklage in my imagination while reading Silent House. Sometimes you place people/actors you know will fit the role, in your mind, for when events and characters are visualized as you read.. I don't know what else to say... Life is a journey straight ahead, there is no turning back from it, there is only memories left. We can relive them, we can brood over them. We can amend our sins of the past through regret and repentance. We can build a new life through our memories.","Dec 22, 2015"
33442627,Maria Ryabinina,"The authors born in Asia (like Orhan Pamuk or Salman Rushdie) always bring a certain glow of a fairytale to their books. The Silent house is no exception, which only makes it more appealing for a Western reader. The is a rusty old house in the Istambul suburb where an old lady lives with her servant who she openly hates. Her three grandchildren pay a visit and thus the story begins, taking the reader to the end of the 70s Turkey, exposing the growing political tension inside the society.. While I was reading, I asked myself several times, why the house is actually silent? Is it only because it is slowly decaying and falling apart? Or maybe because in the story there are actually more internal monologues than real dialogues between actual characters? The members of the family are constantly talking, screaming and crying in the minds, imagining the situations and things they would have done in these situations, however they stay silent on the surface. So the book is also about what we picture ourselves doing but never actually do.. On the first 300 pages the author carefully describes every character in detail, outlining their past and present, like an engineer who describes all the pecularities of the mechanism he himself designed (let's say for peeling the pomegranate). And then in the end he finally triggers off the mechanism cutting the fruit, catalyzing the pinnacle point which is the result of people's actions and desires he described before.. All in all, the book is definitely a pleasure. Especially amid the cold winter evenings in a silent apartment.","Feb 21, 2015"
666282,Nick,"I had a feeling throughout this book that I was missing something in the translation. Written from a half-dozen of the characters' points of view, the book failed to bring them to life in a way that was compelling. I wanted their voices to sound different, but they all ended up rather similar, as if shredded through the switch from one language to another. Or perhaps the subtleties were there, and I just missed them, not really understanding enough about modern Turkey to get what was going on. The book felt like a set piece that was always just about to get started, but never quite did.","Jan 28, 2018"

Written in 1983, it captures the thinking of a young Turkish man speaking through the varied characters, about the changing world in Turkey, pre-1980's Revolution. This novel was not translated until last year (2012) from Turkish into English.. As I had no background in the topic, I found it critical to research the era to learn about Turkey, its factions and its issues to get past the first few chapters. I consulted the flyleaf several times as I was getting acclimated to the author's writing as he became the different characters who narrated each chapter. Cleverly, the chapter heading provided the best clue as the voice was names therein. Still, until I picked up the cadence of the story, I struggled. Later in the book, I wanted to get to closure, perhaps it was because from the research to understand 1980 in Turkey and various book reviews, I was a bit over-drenched in sadness and frustration.. Regardless, I enjoyed how the story was told and found several interesting perspectives well stated (for example, one of the characters hangs out with wealthy schoolmates, but is never at ease as he lives with ""the straightjacket of poverty."" The story seemed one of despair, naivete and resignation. Yet the characters and the story stays with me.","Feb 09, 2013"
2448436,Andy Miller,"This novel, set in 1980 Turkey, shifts in narrative from five characters;Fatma,a 90 year old bitter widower living in her family home, Recep,a dwarf who is Fatma's husband's illegitmate son who lives with Fatma as her servant, Hassan, Recep's nephew whose insecurity and lack of drive leads him into immersion into a Turkish nationalistic(fascist) gang, Faruk who is Fatma's oldest grandson and Merin, Fatma's youngest grandson. Interestingly, the most sympathetic character Nilgin,Fatma's grandaughter who is the one person kind to Recep and her bitter grandmother and gently arbitrates between her two dysfunctional brothers is the one character who never has a voice. The narratives focus on the character's personal lives; Fatma's flashbacks of bitterness at her husband selling off her family jewelry while his idealism descends into alcoholism and possible mental illness, Hassan's insecurity about his place in the nationalist gang and his infatuation with Nilgin, Recep's loneliness and sensitivity about his size, Faruk's depression about losing his wife and not knowing what to with his life and Merin's ill fated attempts to fit into a wealthy clique. The result of these personal stories though is to create a backdrop of the author's views on Western vs Turkish culture, class, and politics. Due to the complex characters and compelling writing the device works quite well","May 30, 2013"
5650786,Anda,"A typical Pamuk's novel: dense, dark, haunted, but lyrical and morbid beautiful. It describes not only the Turkey's struggle for modernity, but the author's itself feelings of captivity and inadequacy. Pamuk's characters are contradictory as, he seems to say, the Turkish people are: half of them would like to live after western's principles and standards, but the other half is still attracted by the Otoman traditional way of being. ""Idealism"" is not only the return to faith in God, but could be also the believe in Nothingness. And this idealism is driven up to craziness. Pamuk's characters do not know the balance; they are either-or. And from here on to the tragedy there only is a small step. You, as reader, expect that something terrible wrong already has happened or will happen, and you are not disappointed.. Besides this almost fatidical ambivalence of Turkey, Pamuk's dedicated another important part of his novel to the question of meaning. Has everything that happens or has happened a meaning, a reason, a cause-effect explanation? Is the historical context the one who generates all daily life events, or on contrary, the small events create the context? Faruk and Nilgün have different opinion about this question, but at the end, what happens with them does evan have a reason?","Aug 10, 2013"
9593877,Stefani,"I had the opportunity to meet Pamuk back in 2013 and I was impressed by the speech he gave. I wanted to read some of his work and got a signed copy of Silent House. I'm so happy to own a signed book by a Nobel Prize winner.. Now, I didn't expect an easy read. Authors that have won big awards are never easy to read for me. However, I can't help but feel slightly disappointed. I had trouble understanding this book and skimmed several parts of it.. I do know a fair bit about Turkey as it's so close to Macedonia and a huge cultural influence. I didn't know much about the period the books is set in though (1980s). Sometimes I was bored. It took me a very long time to finish reading this book. I couldn't understand several political & religious references. I might have even missed some.. It was too long and I still don't know whether I've learnt anything by it. Part of me feels sad about this. I wish I'd made some profound discovery or at least been blown away by the message of the book. I repeat, I think I didn't understand this book.. Rating - 2. I'm sorry to give it such a low rating. He won the Nobel Prize after all. I wish I could call it a literary masterpiece and a favorite book. Maybe I'll reread it when I'm a bit older :/. ps. One of my favorite books, Robinson Crusoe, is mentioned in the conclusion. By far my favorite part of Silent House.","Mar 28, 2014"
28390946,Jishnu ,"The whole story is written in simple language and interesting point of view of the characters. Which you don't often see in other books and some of the character POV's are profoundly described. Especially the one with the Grandmother, the way here thought swings from topic to another is really pleasurable to read. Also the other characters include a dwarf,2 boys a grown up and a girl.. The boys both of them fall in love and their actions are described nicely and at different instances you really feel that you have felt like this before. But as we go into the book the boys brazen in their quest for their loved one. Above all the grandmother's POV is the most intriguing and I would like to quote a thought from her head. "" You can't start out again in life, that's a carriage ride you take once, but with a book in your hand no matter how confusing and perplexing it might be, once you finished it you can always go back to the beginning; if you like read through it again in order to understand what you didn't understand before"". . From the POV of the dwarf we can understand the pain he feels when the world perceives him and above that he's a bastard. Overall it's a good book slow reading can really energise you :)","Jul 23, 2014"
34077479,Avneesh,"In spite of taking more than a month's struggle to finish it, I ended up liking the book. I like how the author has described each significant event from every character's, that was involved in the event, point of view. Though in the end, this doesn't hold true to a certain extent.. What I liked most is his description of each character's feelings. I could actually relate to the narratives about the thoughts that go through a character's mind when they are alone after a situation. The feelings and thoughts are very detailed.. As far as the characters are concerned, I absolutely hated the grandmother. I believe she did some real damage because of her narrow mindedness,for the lack of a better word. I liked the grand-daughter and the dwarf servant, they seemed the only sane people in the entire book. Genuinely caring and with a good heart, because throughout the book not once have they showed a negative tendency. All the other boys, the grandsons and Hasan especially, I hated. The reason for that might be evident to anyone who reads the book.. All in all, Orhan Pamuk has written a good book. It takes some time to grasp the narrative style but it does leave an impression on you. Will read another book from him soon.","Oct 29, 2014"
13133475,Revathi,"Well, the story revolves around Fatma's family and her husband's bastard children.. Written in a laid back form one wouldn't expect a death in the house, or maybe if we readers did it would have been Fatma's because of her old age and her very pessimistic way of seeing life. Politics yes there is as it portrays how one character agrees to one ideology and the other to another without being biased. Refreshing I might add as to Pamuk's way of narrating this story that keeps me holding on to the book till the very end. Each chapter begins with different characters from the family's point of view. The death itself devastated me and took me awhile to recover from it as it came swiftly in silence.. Silent House,. The title, it got me first hand and I was wondering why Silent House?. Is it because of how the people in the house are? Quiet.... or Is it because of the way things where hushed?. Or Fatma as she remained in silence ever since she came to that house with her husband after fleeing from Istanbul?. Or the Ending?. For me I would tell all of it where brought in and knitted into this story.. Find my review misleading? Well go ahead and embark on this journey that Pamuk has set.. Bon Voyage!","Nov 12, 2014"
16013897,Kanwar Anand,"The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because it had no character that I fell in love with. To have a character that is great is very important for a fictional novel to be 5 stars. Look at catcher in the rye, A clockwork orange, Old man and the sea, art of racing in the rain and even Angela's Ashes. However, I began with a negative direction but let me tell you this book is beyond description. The characters are savages who get from boring to good and you keep zooming in and out of their lives. I would be shocked if the point of views of this many a diverse kind of people can be presented any better.. IT IS QUOTABLE. It will cover almost every concept of life. Morality, death, God, religion, cowardice, business, social stigmas, old age melancholy, nostalgia, science, this book is a pile of all that.. Its most redeeming feature is its depth of field. It really surprises you time and gain. Every single character has a quality or a thought that you will relate to.. I related to the dwarf when he was anti social..

6672631,James K,"I like the idea of the multi-charactered narratives, and the unique voices of each, especially of the Grandmother and Faruk, even if it is a little Faulkner-esque. (Even the almost pastiche like chapter titles--'Recep Goes to the Movies' or 'Metin Socialises'--work in some way.). The book is a simple one focusing on a Grandmother and a dwarf--her servant and husband's illegitimate son--living in a village outside of Istanbul, trapped in time, trapped away from the capital's impending and mounting troubles of politics and religion. That is until her family from Istanbul come to visit thus providing the catalyst for the merging of histories, tradition, and the age old battle between East and West (that first started with the Grandmother's late husband).. Much like Pamuk the same themes are dealt with here including philosophy, truth, history, identity, duplicity--along with politics of course. And the narrative voices are well created, and as much as I did enjoy the book I did not 'love' it. It seems more like a practice run than anything else, with some of the character chapters being bogged down in everyday banality.","Aug 18, 2013"
21277858,Rachel Aloise,"For my first reading of Orhan Pamuk I chose this early novel, as it offers an accessible introduction to many of the themes running through his later much acclaimed works (which are now high on my reading list). I was not disappointed! The novel could appear a bit schematic since each character embodies a different ideology (between the leftist, liberal intelligentsia or fundamentalist views). Yet the nuanced way in which each character is given voice, for the most part through silent inner-monologues, rings very true. It’s a poignant read, especially in a context where democracy in Turkey is as fragile as ever.. It took some time for me connect with the writing style of short chapters with alternating narrators. And it wasn’t until well over 100 pages into the book (Ch 11) that I became completely absorbed in the reading. In this chapter Fatma's, the grandmother’s, musings about the past merge seamlessly with present day dialog (or lack thereof), showing the irreconcilably differences, both within a family and within a highly polarized society. Fascinating and devastating, Fatma is one of the book’s most unkind yet compelling voices.","Nov 01, 2013"

16132677,Ubaid Dhiyan,"Silent House was only Orhan Pamuk's second novel but it shows the assuredness of voice and narration that is characteristic of the future Nobel Prize winner. The novel is set outside of Istanbul, in the beach town of Cennethisar a crumbling mansion houses an old widow, Fatma, and her servant, the dwarf Recep. As she eagerly anticipates the arrival of her three grandchildren Fatma reminisces of her husband, a doctor and aspiring social reformer who died a hopeless alcoholic crushed by the scope of his ambition to explain the West to the East through a comprehensive encyclopedia. Each of Fatma's three grandchildren and a supporting cast of characters represent aspects of Turkish society as it struggled to bridge its Eastern values to ideas imported from the West. This is a recurring theme in Pamuk's work and seems to me an obsession not just of his but of the entire Turkish nation. It is hard to tease out the causality for this conflict, is it the country's history, or is it its geography? Pamuk suggests it is both. Definitely recommended.","Aug 02, 2013"

Margaret, a fellow goodreader, read this in Turkish and commented on the different register of each narrator. I read this in translation and I am sad to say that this differentiation didn't survive the translation which was a pity.. The story takes place during a weekend in the summer. Three grandchildren visit their reclusive grandmother, their last surviving relative, who is attended to by Recep, a dwarf, in her crumbling old house. As the story develops it gets progressively darker..

The now deceased grandfather embraced science of the west yet grandmother feared these thinkings and held on to eastern traditions.

Told from the point of view of five characters--two brothers, their elderly grandmother, her dwarf manservant, and his teenage nephew--this was a book that benefits from the multiple narrators.. There were two things that fascinated me about this book. 1) The way Pamuk was able to perfectly capture what I imagine to be the mind wanderings of a insomnia nonagenerian and 2) the capturing the self-involved stream of consciousness that often afflicts the late teens/early twenties set.. Perhaps it was a reflection of the time it which it was written, but the women's roles were so limp and powerless, I often felt I wanted advise them on better ways to live their lives.","Aug 11, 2013"

The manner in which he bases his story right in between the landmass separating Asia and Europe, East and West outlaws any other stories I have read lately. Pamuk has this way of delineating mundane themes which we don't really talk about in an intricate and introspective way. I could relate to each character from this book a lot and I cannot put it down in words how sad I felt as the story was drawing close and how happy and hopeful I felt when it finally closed its gates..

20509875,Noura Alnaimi,"All the books that i have read by Orhan Pamuk were rich with details, but this book was different it was light and somehow silent, Fatma's case was interesting, Faruk's searching for history .. but it was short .. i have read this book exactly after watching the famous turkish series ""öyle bir geçer zaman ki"", i saw almost the same thing in terms of the politics for example Nilgün in the book was like Berrin in the series. . yet the book had some of Pamuk's inspiring sentences.","Dec 18, 2013"
15858631,Nazbanou Nozari,"3.5 stars is the accurate rating. This book does not have the elegance of Snow or My Name is Red, but in its own subtle way it tells a story of a nation through changing times. Having experienced a similar cultural change, the book hits home with issues like the clash of belief and atheism, tradition and modernization, bridging the gap between previously distinct layers of an aristocratic society, in a story sprinkled with tokens of love, despair, envy, and hatred.","Apr 12, 2014"

All the characters in the novel are so true that you can't help but feel empathy for each and every one of them. The themes treated are also very complex and profound, and the author's style and the structure of the novel are so fine that it can be considered a true contemporary masterpiece.","Jun 07, 2016"

Written in 1983 and translated in English only a few years ago, ""Silent House"" is ostensibly about an old woman visited by her grandchildren during one summer, but there is an undercurrent of political and cultural tension. Pamuk's technique of having the novel's chapters narrated from the point of view of alternating characters is highly effective. Recommended.","Dec 18, 2016"

1367779,Azimah  Othman,"Although this is only the second novel of Pamuk I am reading, I am surprised to find that it is a fairly easy read. His style is evident right from the start. The book grips you like no other..... I find that some additional reading on Turkish history helps. My initial thought though has always been that it should decide whether it considers itself Asian or Middle Eastern....or European as it strives to bring itself into modernity.. There are five narrators each exchanging thoughts, experiences, ideas, history, memories and politics as Turkey struggles for modernity.. 1. Fatma. A 90 year old bedridden matriach living in a run down mansion in Cennethisar not far from Istanbul. She awaits the coming of her three grandchildren's annual summer visit whence they would then visit the graves of their grandfather and parents.. She was married at 15 to Dr Selahattin whose dabbling in politics cost him his future. They had to move out of Istanbul to the fishing village of Cennethisar and serve the poor fishermen, often not charging them. In his dream to westernise his people, he embarked on writing a 48-volume encyclopedia. In the meantime livelihood depended on whatever piece of jewellery he could make Fatma part with..... Alas, before the writings could be completed, the official national script had been changed to the western alphabet...... 2. Recep. He and his brother, Ismail are Selahattin's illegitimate sons...another reason for Fatma's bitterness towards her husband.. The mother's husband had joined the navy and never returned. Selahattin built a shack for her . One day when he was not home, Fatma went into the shack with her cane ....mother and her two boys were at the end of her cane. Resep grows into a dwarf and serves as a servant in the mansion. Ismail grows with a limp and sells lottery tickets.. 3. Faruk. Eldest of three grandchildren of Fatma. Fat and an alcaholic like his father and grandfather. A history teacher and spends a lot of time researching at the archive. One wonders why his wife left him.. 4. Metin. Faruk's high school brother whose dream is to go to the US. He persuades his grandmother to sell the mansion. Keeps the company of tbe high class.. I wonder why their sister , Nilgun is not a narrator. She has a communist leaning and I wonder if that might be the reason...... 5. Hasan. He is Ismail's son. Whilst Ismail is always instilling the need to study, Hasan keeps the company of nationalist vigilantes.. Secretly, he has feelings for Nilgun. Like Metin, they seem to be in love with girls of higher class......... I am ok with Finn's translation...... to the point.....","Jan 05, 2019"
92359114,Harres Yk,"""At that moment, I wished my whole consciousness could be erased. I wanted to escape from my own awareness, to wander freely in a world outside my own mind, but understanding now that I would always be two people, I realized that I'd never be able to let go."". The book explores political tensions just before a military coup through the microcosm of a family gathering in the house of a embittered and weary grandmother, who is kept awake at night by memories of her late husband - a man who had doggedly spent his life writing books and doing experiments in the hope that the Eastern world could unshackle themselves and become like the Western world. The book does an excellent job, as exemplified in the quote above, at conveying the intense turmoil, inferiority complexes and social disharmony which were precursors to the military coup of 1980. The book also forces the reader to confront some uncomfortable truths about the lack of self-criticism in the Eastern, mainly Islamic, world which according to one of the book's protagonist, is primarily due to an unwillingness to accept the eventuality of 'nothingness' at death and a corresponding lack of fear of death. It is only through acceptance of the most painful things in life that we are able to make our life meaningful, and this novel explores how the Eastern world has not discovered this. The characters seem to flit in and out of days, and there is an over-encompassing grey mood where you get the feeling that people's lives are not truly being lived, perhaps due to cultural reasons.. This was my first Pamuk read, and I would highly recommend it.","Jun 22, 2019"
79971210,Dječak,"Silent House is Pamuk's second novel, published in 1983. Told through the perspective of five characters and their stream of consciousness in a time-frame of seven days in 1980. (one week before 12 Eylül Darbesi) in Cennethisar (a fictional small city near Istanbul), Silent House is a magnificent story about the downfall of the Darvinoglu family. Pamuk's switching narrative that expands from 90-year-old schizophrenic Fatma Darvinoglu, her midget servant Redžep (child from an affair her late husband Selahattin had with servant), Hasan, Redžep's nephew who's father is the second child from Selahattin's affair all the way through Fatma's grandsons Faruk and Metin is the main reason that makes this novel breath-taking. A complicated spider-web of plots that include escape from religion-prison into science-madness of Selahattin who spent all his life trying to wake up nation covered with the cloak of blind believing with writing never-finished encyclopedia only to die in alcohol sorrow, sad and humiliating life of midget-servant Redžep under the hands of iron lady Fatma who blamed him for the sins of her husband for years, Turkish political tensions in Istanbul foreseen through eyes of Redžep's nephew Hasan who has been involved into young and senseless fighting with tragic ending, finishing with Metin's unsuccessful tries to fit into turquoise lifestyle of rich Istanbul families and his brother's way to rock-bottom and dying from alcohol like his father and grandfather did are only few in the maze of secret motives and light-motives which were always a significiant part in Orhan Pamuk's writings.","Jan 08, 2020"
104597657,Tuana Nova,"I love reading Pamuk due to the fact that his fiction is mainly influenced by the history of late Ottoman Empire and Istanbul. Silent House did not disappoint me in that aspect. By reading this book, you will gain some basic introductory knowledge about Turkey’s internal affairs and political unsettlement in 1980’s. Some of the dominant main themes of this book are death, displacement, manipulation, power struggle, class struggle, circle of life, identity crisis, change vs. tradition, desire to escape, role of religion, men vs. women, and pride. It starts with Fatma Darvinoglu’s (Darvinson) grandchildren’s routine summer visit to see their grandmother in Cennethisari. The narrators rotate throughout the story. While the power struggle between nationalists, idealists, and communists is told via characters with different ideologies, these characters’ identity crisis are also greatly broadcasted which will feel familiar for Pamuk readers.. If you haven’t read Pamuk before, I do not suggest you to start reading him with Silent House. I would recommend starting with The Museum of Innocence or The Red Haired Woman since this work can feel a little slow-paced.. Have a pleasant reading!. “You can’t start out again in life, that’s a carriage ride you only take once, but with a book in your hand, no matter how confusing and perplexing it might be, once you’ve finished it, you can always go back to the beginning; if you like, you can read it through again, in order to figure out what you couldn’t understand before, in order to understand life, isn’t that so, Fatma?” (334)","Feb 11, 2020"

Involved in the story are Fatma, the grandmother; her three grandchildren, Faruk, Nilgun, and Metin; her husband's illegitimate son, Recep, who is her caregiver; and Hasan, her husband's illegitimate grandson. Very present in the story are Fatma's dead husband and son.. This is a very different book with an entire page being one sentence because the sentence is a thought in a person's head. Threaded throughout the book are the complexities of human relationships, especially in families, politics in the setting of 1980's Turkey, alcoholism, unstable mental conditions, religion, and young people struggling to find their place in their world.. The story has a strange ending. Why is the house silent is what you are left to wonder.","Nov 16, 2018"

Each chapter is narrated by a different character. I thought the author did a good job advancing the plot, but the character development could have been a bit better. It might have been better if he had focused on a smaller number of characters and developed them more. I also thought that the book presupposed the reader had some familiarity with Turkish history, and might be somewhat confusing for readers who did not.","Aug 29, 2017"

Pamuk has a concept in his books that he just repeats and repeats and after first book you amazing, the second one is good still but the third one and later you get sick of that. You understand that even it is superficial and you get them deeper than what they are.. for example in this book you really barely can find an artistic thing. just simply telling the story. and even the simplicity itself is not artistic (like Hemingway stories).

61384542,Pshpshmysh,"It touched me and horrified me deeply. This book tells the heartbreaking story of a family who is torn between sin and its absence, money and its absence, love and its absence, silence and its absence. Almost all of the male characters in the family are deeply unsatisfied with their lives (except for Recep, maybe, he acts like a soul-frozen creature) - their unwillingness to act and change, their inner weakness causes their family's misery.. 4 stars because for some reason it was not as absorbing as Pamuk's.

54035116,Sonia Francis,"I have read Museum Of Innocence and there is a single thread that runs through both books- obsession. It is the kind of emotional obsession that Pamuk gives his characters that makes you impatient, love and hate them at the same time, and yet you stick with them. This is because Pamuk words mesmerizes you and makes you question a thin line between sentimental and erotic obsession.. I loved these characters, they were so realized.

94497373,jhnm,"Silent House is the weakest Orhan Pamuk novel that I’ve read to date (I’ve yet to read The White Castle). As someone with a limited knowledge of Turkish society and politics circa 1980, I had some difficulty engaging with the text and I found certain aspects of the story to be arcane, but that’s not a fault of the author. The structure of the novel, with chapters told from the perspective of five different characters, is an excellent narrative device. However, the individual narratives are somewhat uneven. The story of Recep, perhaps the most interesting character, is particularly underdeveloped. Overall Silent House shows how Orhan Pamuk was developing as a writer early in his literary career before going on to write The Black Book and My Name is Red, two of my favourite books.","Apr 01, 2020"
926729,Hasan,"Silent House takes place in a time of political upheviel in Turkey – seems that could be any time. The story is told through several of the main charaters.

Two of the characters , Hasan and Metin, were so similar to an amateur reader like me that I'm surprised the author didn't catch it too.

The book is historical, moody, heavy in atmosphere and the characters are so very well developed. I was hooked after the first few paragraphs. I was stunned after the start of the second chapter.

The author shows that life actually is ordinary. There is nothing ornamental or special in the lives of most people. It also gives us a peek in the minds of old people who have nothing new to think of, who are just bidding their time. They have nothing to do but revisit the memories which have long evaporated. The author's description of death and nothingness sends a chill to the bones. Personally, I feel the book is open-ended, way more than I would have liked. I would have liked some finalty or closure after Nilgun's death. I would have liked to see Fatma's or Hasan's reaction on learning of her death. But not finding it gives a sense of incompleteness. Maybe that was what the author had intended.","Mar 14, 2017"

8844875,stephanie roberts,"""Who are you? Don't you recognize me, we played hide-and-seek, I love you, I love you more than all those fine fellows you know could ever possibly love!"". So declares one supposed lover. ""Who are you?"" is an important question but not as important as Hasan's bold obsession, and obsession is what Orhan Pamuk does; the trough to which I gladly return, book after book. Midway through. Silent House. I felt nostalgic for the greater sweep of past reading that encompass more indepth thought on politics and religion, but Pamuk is a deft story teller and very gradually I found myself enthralled in the net of the four characters whose stories are simultaneous woven through the narrative.. There is: Hasan the disaffected youth, Faruk the historian at war within himself (he loves and misses his ex-wife he seems to have inherited his grandfather and father's inability to grasp the fruit of their intellectual obsessions, drinking away his melancholy), Metin who sees Turkey as a sort of spiritual wasteland where the future is not to be found, and Fatma the grandmother, who had the power to be a force for good in the lives of her grandchildren and step-children, but she is unable to see past the restraints of her religion and her memories of the past, like the little girl she longs to be she lives a life where her only power is refusal. It is a grand tale following the thin hopes and disappointments of three generations. Women in the narrative become symbols of the unattainable hopes of the men. The psychology of it is fascinating to me. The women are not written diminished as they are by Fitzgerald, but it is apparent that when the woman is the object of obsession of these turkish men the real woman is lost, the men see only themselves.. Does he love the girl that he seemingly is burning over? They don't really know them. One character appears to fall in love with his image of a woman over the course of a couple of days where nothing of consequence is said between the two. Does he love her or does she represent the unfairness of his life, and a world he may not have because the fates have been unkind. How else to explain the unreasoning violence that acts itself out from start to finish in the minds and actions of the supposed lovers. I must have been 80% of the way through in this story feeling a little sorry for myself that this wasn't as exciting as the art and history of,. My Name is Red. or as articulate about the heart of obsession as is explored in. Snow. and. The Museum of Innocence. .. The climax of the story is very near the end, but the future changes the past and I found the ending entirely redeems what I had originally felt was a smaller intellectual landscape of this book. Smaller relationships, smaller politics, a smaller Turkish history. The dénouement made me regret my judgement and my lukewarm attitude. I fell deeply in love with this book; it utterly captured my imagination, and I think it is almost as good as. My Name is Red. . No murder plot, no mystery, no political intrigues, no decades of obsessive love, just complex and sympathetically drawn characters, and the mesmerizing story-telling that strengthens my faith in the contemporary novel, and has made me such a fan of this author. Compared to his other books a quick read, but with really depth and satisfaction. This is a must read for the lover of the literary fiction genre and the novel lover.","Sep 27, 2014"
37916111,Leahbh,"This is an early novel by Pamuk but I think it just became available in English a few years back. Set in Turkey in the late 1970s, a very interesting read against the backdrop of current events both there and here. Interplay among a small group of related characters over several generations that explores the struggles of a society with traditionalists, modernists, Islamists, secularists, nationalists and progressives, elites, ""perceived elites"" and a repressed underclass (some accepting and others seething). Well, I don't know that we learn any lessons but it is a revealing and timely portrait.","Jan 01, 2017"
5971858,Zara Garcia-Alvarez of The Bibliotaphe Closet Blog,"Silent House, by Nobel Prize in Literature winner, Orhan Pamuk, is a dramatic and detailed story of a Turkish family bound by a dark history beginning in Cennethisar, a former village near Istanbul.. The novel is driven by its characters more so than its plot through a series of stream-of-conscious, inner forms of dialogue that recall sporadic memories and reveal the characters’ deeply rooted biases and fears.. There is Recep Efendi, a 55-year-old dwarf who resides in the Darvinğlu mansion as a servant and loyal caregiver to Fatma Karatash-Darvinğlu, a 90-year-old, bedridden grandmother whom he refers to as Madam.. And Fatma Darvinğlu , herself, a devout, religious, upper class woman whose age and obstinate beliefs chiselled her into a cold, proud, and bitter woman who punishes those around her due to her grief and disappointment in love, marriage, righteousness, and the inauthenticity of the modern world, which she misunderstands, fears, and loathes.. The two of them together, await the arrival of her now grown grandchildren for their annual summer visit at Shore Avenue, No. 12, Cennethisar: Faruk, recently divorced and an associate professor and avid historian whose love for the Gezbe archives and its contained past inspires him to want to write a story of no obvious connections or interpretations; Nilgun, a beautiful woman whose warm affection, intelligence and leftist beliefs bring her unwanted attention and danger; and Metin, who considers himself the most practical of his siblings and an intelligent tutor of mathematics whose talent to multiply any pair of two-digit numbers in his head ostracize him from his pretentious group of friends.. As the story slowly unravels, the reader learns about the grievances caused by Fatma’s ambitious and high-strung husband whose sole obsession to write and publish a scientific encyclopedia drives his marriage and finances to the ground.. This hunger for knowledge is eventually passed down to their son, Doğan, who aspired to be more like his father, became a direct administrator in the east, and signed up for politics. Much to Fatma’s opinion and dismay, like his father, he intrinsically felt responsible “for all the crimes and sins and injustice in [the] world,” at which point she wished he didn’t feel that way so that he would listen to her instead and not suffer, nor be agitated..

32690311,Anne Millen,"This is a fascinating book. For me, the house was Turkey, the grandmother was the rigid, suspicious and change-resistant government, the visiting grandchildren the different faces of modern Turks. It is my favourite, so far, of Orhan Pamuk's books, because it is so clear but so deep, so light but so layered in meaning. To read it is to be in Turkey.","Feb 25, 2017"
15157516,Zeenath Naseer,"2 and half stars. Having to read (or is it listen?) the inner ramblings of about 5 major characters was a bit tedious especially when there seemed to be no discernible plot. That said - some of the characters were great, Salahattin for instance whom the reader gets to know through the grandmother's rants inside her head turns out to be a darling intellectual nuthead. A kinda plotless book I guess - i never managed to grasp it. Kept mixing up some names which was rather exasperating. Loved the angelic dwarf though.","Jun 27, 2017"
16513352,Shatha Ali,"Another disappointing book!! honestly I expected so much and I got so little. I do not actually know if I am too picky when it comes to books or is it the translation that made it less valuable?. I was lost, not knowing what Orhan wanted; he made no standing point. And the characters are highly annoying, it is quite surprising how three characters were of similar personalities?! The fact they all feel bullied, ignored and unloved. And that they are too greedy for money. It was not catchy.. I know I may come offensive to some, specially fans or those fell in love with the book, but truth to be told I finished the last page and not for a second it grabbed me or even rose any certain emotions (beside that I was relieved of getting DONE WITH IT).. Also, I was really looking forward some interesting points about Turkey's political position and issues at that period, but all I got was teenagers' ranting.","Aug 06, 2015"
7572321,Kayla,"""There must be more to history, I thought, than just copying things down and linking a string of events together to make a story."". The above quote from this book describes it to a T (no pun intended). While there are several different perspectives being shared in this book, nothing really ever happens. I was hoping that by the end of it, something would happen that ties everything together in a profound way that would have made it worth the effort to read several sentences that were pages and pages long. Because the book switches so often between points of view, it is hard to keep track of who is who. While it is nice being able to see inside the characters' heads, not much else happens beyond that.. ""...But with a book in your hand, no matter how confusing and perplexing it might be, once you've finished it, you can always of back to the beginning of it..."". That, I will not be doing.","Dec 31, 2012"
3722823,Thing Two,"In the shadow of a country in turmoil, Orhan Pamuk introduces the turbulent family of Fatma and her greedy grandchildren. Faruk, the eldest, is a divorced, historian who lives life with a bottle in hand, sister Nilgun takes her morning trips to the beach oblivious to those who struggle around her, and Metin dreams about going to America -- if only he can convince grandmother to tear down the family compound. Thrown into the mix are Recep, the illegitimate son of Fatma's late husband, who serves Fatma as a constant companion/servant even though Fatma is convinced he's trying to do her in, and Recep's nephew, Hasan, who is in love with Nilgun, jealous of Metin, and will lead the visiting grandchildren into a struggle they will never forget.. An excellent introduction to Pamuk - easy to read, well-paced, and well-written.","Jun 15, 2013"
30511565,Liz Polding,"Weighty themes handled in a very human way. Tension between old and new regimes leading to a shocking act of brutality which mirrors the idealogical struggles taking place outside the insular world in which the family live. There are so many different perspectives here; all thinking that they have the answers. Communism, nationalism, humanism, science, religion; each with the absolute certainty that they are right and that this justifies whatever they choose to do. Not that the characters are unsympathetic or allegorical; far from it. Each is fully human, with their own frustrations and each in their different way tries to do what they think is best. I enjoyed this as much as, and perhaps more than, The Museum of Innocence. It is always difficult to make a completely accurate judgement about a translated work, but this was a highly satisfying read and I recommend it.","Apr 13, 2014"
1950744,Christos,"I found it difficult to get into this book, not least because many of the characters were unappealing and because the narrative perspective kept shifting between different voices. I was also a bit disappointed that the female characters were rather thinly drawn, and mostly served as props to explore the motivations and intentions of the male characters. Even the lone female narrative voice, the ninety-year old grandmother and matriarch of the family, largely tells her story through recollections of her husband's increasing narcissim and rejection of God and tradition, as she reacts by retreating into her room and obsessing over her dwindling jewelry collection. Still, in parts the writing was strong, and I appreciated the author's attempted exploration of the overarching conflict between nationalism, communism, westernization, and tradition in Turkey.","Mar 05, 2015"
11521701,Heather,"This one just wasn't for me. If you like character-driven books, you may like it more than I did. I read it because the author was a Nobel winner, and I was interested in Turkey. The point of view shifts each chapter between different characters. Some of them were completely stream of consciousness, which drove me crazy. They'd also shift between thinking and speaking, and I didn't always track. The first three quarters of the book was really slow. Not much happened, and I was not interested in the characters. The pace picked up quite a bit in the last quarter, and I almost liked that part, but then it just ended. There was some political and social unrest, but I didn't feel like I got a lot of insight into Turkey, in particular. It felt like it could have been set in a lot of different places.","Apr 04, 2015"
13592286,Eileen Iciek,"Orhan Pamuk is an award winning writer, but not a best selling one, I think. This book was good, but nothing much happens in the first half. If you can make it through to the second half, some action does get going, but not much until the rather shocking end. There are various POVs in the book - a 90 year old grandmother; her servant, a dwarf, who also happens to be the grandmother's dead husband's bastard; the dwarf's nephew; the grandmother's two grandsons.. The story is well written, thoughtful, and does a good job of describing Turkish life in about 1980. Even so, I'm not sure this is a story that most people will find interesting. It has an unsettling feeling at the end, somewhat akin to the ending of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, when someone dies and the guilty seem to be getting away with murder.","Feb 10, 2016"
2546677,Janine,"My first Pamuk book and it took my a while to get into it. Each character has its own part but there seemed too many at the beginning to understand how it all ties together. Later I learned to appreciate the subtle events rather than waiting for a big one, which does not occur. Its simply a family drama, set against Turkey's history, with characters that devoted a lifetime to a political or historical cause without success. Its a story of living life, moving on, and sometimes not, of becoming old and being lonely. ""The world is a place to be described and experienced as is, usually with equanimity, occasionally with gusto or as something bittersweet; but its not a place for finding fault or cause for anger while your're in it."" This describes exactly what Pamuk does with Silent House.","Oct 02, 2012"
117848,Aletha Tavares,"My house is rather silent and the only noise one hears is the ticking of the clocks. so when I took up Orhan's book, I wondered what 'memories' it would hold. His characters as usual are simple, everyday people, with thoughts and dreams that we all have from time to time. Of course with a historian thrown in along with flashbacks of a rebel, it, i won't say gripped me, but swirled around me gently in its thick overcoat, snuggly, reminding me that when family does come together, its memories that float up and the present day person is often difficult to relate to when distance creates that chasm- but ties do bind, and a house does lives on despite its stone and brick and mortar, its windows and doors!","Oct 23, 2012"
3388338,Lisa,"""The socio-political environment of 1980 Turkey is reflected in family dynamics during an annual week-long visit to see grandma. Two families by one man experience life's hardships differently but the family history is never discussed and naturally violence ensues. The silent house on the hill is a mini Turkey complete with more affluent communists and indigent nationalists. The now deceased grandfather embraced science of the west yet grandmother feared these thinkings and held on to eastern traditions. I was excited to see another of Pamuk's works was translated, then I was dismayed to notice it had been published in Turkish 30 years ago. But of course his lessons remain current, meaningful, and poignant.""","Dec 03, 2012"
572504,Naureen,"Another kind of random selection from my strange local library wing! I had high hopes since the author won the Nobel Prize for Literature, and I was interested to learn about Turkey (where the author is from and where the book takes place). However, I found it hard to get through this book -- maybe it was partly because it was a translation (originally written in Turkish)? The chapters rotated around the main characters' individual perspectives, which I normally don't mind -- but some characters' story lines were much more interesting than others! It was interesting to get some insight into Turkey and the internal struggles between the nationalists and the communists, and the rich and the poor.","Aug 31, 2013"
7083616,Claire,"I really wanted to like this, and I can appreciate how well written it is, with beautiful language and excellent character exploration, but if I'm honest that's all it had and there was no storyline whatsoever. It was more of a snapshot in a families life, and the exploration of each character in different chapters, and their personal stories as well as the relationships together. For me though, I need a plot to actually go somewhere and this just never did. I was having to force my way through it each night, and my pile of new books to read is so large than in the end I gave up about 3/4 of the way through because time is too short to waste on books you hate. I feel bad I didn't like this because I can see why others do, but it really wasn't for me.","Feb 26, 2014"
16017405,Sally Bourne,"Beautifully woven prose with the texture of each character so carefully drawn so as to really know each one of the main protagonists. The story is reflective of the political tensions being played out at the time, also describing how Turkey had been and glimpses of what it was to become. I also liked Parmuk's reference to himself as a Orhan a person they knew who wanted to write a novel and his advice at the end concerning the beauty of books and that if you don't understand them on first reading you can, unlike life start again. I give it 5 stars and although not as amazing as Museum of Innocence, this is only Pamuk's second novel.","Jan 02, 2013"
16086956,Robin,"This book has me scratching my head - I can't quite decide how I feel about it overall. I was intrigued by the first few chapters, but then decided as I read further that I really disliked most of the characters and found their thoughts to be maddeningly repetitive and unrealistically idiotic. I slogged through the middle of the book, forcing myself on because I really wanted to finish it and find something redeeming about it. I was surprised to be drawn back into the story in the end, although it was depressing. Ultimately, I found the last chapter to be strangely, sadly beautiful in a lonely way. I think this book could have been edited down to half its length and been more powerful.","Feb 13, 2013"
105743,Sanjay,"The book got off to a slow start. I was impatient through the middle but the superb writing made it a breeze. But I don't know why I ever doubted Orhan. Every sentence has a consequence -- either in the story or in the reader's mind. The parallel lives over time, the question of what is history, the question of whether stories should have meanings, the difference between East and West, the point or pointlessness of hope for change from within and the complex nature of Turkish identity are all told through just a handful of vividly-painted characters. Wow. Persevere and you will be richly rewarded.","Aug 22, 2013"
1012436,Salvatore,"Much more of a trot in pace compared to My Name Is Red. Probably because it's a contemporary set novel where the mystery is the action that is going to happen, not where one happens before you. A grandmother - who speaks to her dead husband throughout - is visited upon by her three orphaned, Istanbul-living grandchildren. No one sees eye to eye, no one truly understands each other, yet they all live in the same home, or tread the same paths, or share a similar history & have now grown apart. Politics infiltrates a vacation. History is factual or storytelling or more. Is this really a land of East v West?","Aug 22, 2015"

52823808,Stijn,"When I started reading I had certain expectations, which later turned out not to be correct, since I normally read young adult science fiction and Silent House is something completely different. Therefore, one of the reasons I have read this novel is because my Turkish friends gave it to me as a gift. But also because I actually wanted to try something different. At times I found Pamuk’s writing style irritating, because there were no boundaries between thoughts and conversations. In my opinion it’s a great novel and it tells about another culture on the edge of modernization, but it’s not a novel I would recommend if you want to read with ease a novel.","Feb 18, 2016"

He is the servant of the household, the illegitimate child of the grandfather who used to run the house. He laments his dwarfism, and his lower status in the family circle.. It also narrates the story of grandmother who is trapped in her past. It explores the subject of death and how different protagonists perceive death with their distinct personalities.. It touches the conflict between modernization (west) and tradition (east) in identifying what Turkey was, is and will be. A little dark and morbid at times.","Mar 30, 2016"
28927044,Fusun Dulger charles,"Orhan Pamuk is an amazing story teller and an amazing writer. His descriptions of places, people and emotions are amazing.. Having said that he reminds me of Sartre, existentialist, nihilist, God does not exist, our lives are a series of events, we get old and die. We dream a lot of projects to no avail. Even love is a waste of time, so is work.. Drinking to forget for some is the solution. Crime is left unpunished.. I must add that Mr. Pamuk is also doing an analogy between Ottoman Turkey and the ""New"" Turkey..

It also tells their individual stories as they struggle with romance, business, studies and class. Stories that anyone with a family can relate to. These stories are set in Turkey on the verge of the military coup in 1980. This political tension doesn't have the immediacy of Pamuk's novel ""Snow"" but it creates a tension of ideals, past vs. present, eastern beliefs vs. western materialism, communism vs. individualism.","Mar 13, 2013"

The audio features different voices for each character and was well produced. I was reminded of Turgenev, with same Russian longing for the West but also fine writing. I recommend reading this before his other novels. It's a good book. At the end someone relishes reading, saying that with a book in your hand you can always go back to the beginning.","May 31, 2013"

The blurb sounded interesting promising a story about a Grandmother, her Grandchildren who come to visit and the bastard dwarf who serves her. Perhaps it is a cultural thing. I am into action with some reflection and look for interesting things to do. This is a book told in 1st person with every thought and every imagined conversation told. I wished I could proceed, but quit very quickly.","Aug 11, 2013"

There are enough great books out there, and life's too short. Shame really, as I'd paid full price for the book and was really looking forward to being immersed in another culture. Didn't happen.. I gather my husband ditched it part way through too, which surprised me a bit as he wades through some quite dense books and reads much faster than me..

10598743,Dominic Carrillo,"My first Pamuk book. It started off slow, and took me a while to sort out the characters, but once I had a chunk of time to read, it really pulled me in. My favorite thing was the author's voice-- his choice of words. Pamuk seems to be a natural intellectual-- one that doesn't try to hard, but challenges the reader. If you asked me half way through if I'd recommend The Silent House I'd say NO. But once I'd finished, I didn't want it to end, and I went out and bought another Pamuk novel: Museum of Innocence.","Dec 05, 2013"
31821413,Lauren,"I was really disappointed by this and I found it rather dull and slow moving. I struggled to finish it and took about 6 months to do so (which is extremely unusual for me). I really wanted to like it, but I just didn't. I think that it must have lost a lot in the translation. The author is the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, but this particular novel was not a good introduction to his work. I think that I will try My Name Is Red later in the year because I have heard that is good.","May 29, 2014"
35262380,Ghada,"This was a brilliant book that I hardly put down till I finished it. though it's not recommended for the casual reader for plenty of reasons; Pamuk doesn't apply the normal aspects of writing a novel. .here every chapter is narrated in one of the character's voices mostly as an inner monologue..each of them represents different political ideologies... we meet three generations in this silent house, representing how the country transformed. you definitely wouldn't help but dislike the grandmother and pity her in the same time.. fascinating book that I will definitely read again.","Sep 24, 2014"
22120912,Mshelton50,"Through the story of three generations of the Darvinoglu family, Pamuk tells the story of modern Turkey. While one half of the family desperately wants to be ""modern"" like the West, the other half looks back to the Ottoman past with longing. Set in 1980 just before a military coup, as nationalist thugs and Communist toughs shake down businesses and beat up those they see as ""enemies,"" the youngest generation of Darvinoglus visit their Grandmother in Cennethisar. And their Grandmother's servant, Recep, has quite a story to tell. A very fine, and beautifully written, novel.","Feb 02, 2015"
52849280,Iris AE,"Very detached characters. The sense of hopelessness and uselessness, no future, no perspective and the injustices done due to social origin among young people who are the generation to change prejudices and stereotypes is infuriating. It seems to me that Pamuk deliberately chose less educated characters who cannot reason (Hasan, Serdar and the likes).. However, to tell a story in five different voices is quite some achievement, and the style and use of language is impressive. Three stars because it is really well written.","Feb 19, 2016"
5361051,Biskin,"Well, what to say. You sit through page after page and just as you are rolling your eyes from the boredom and minutia you have to sit through, he knocks you on your ass with something so powerful you can barely breath. This isn't one of his greatest - I still think ""The New Life"" is my personal favourite, but the ending, while not completely surprising, is still so rich and deep it leaves one in tears. So yeah, read it, or don't. Just don't spend too much time deciding because we only live once.","Feb 01, 2017"
115272550,Madeline,"Despite really not enjoying the plot, I enjoyed the way in which Pamuk writes. At times this brought out much anger and frustration at individual characters of Silent House. At other moments, it reminded me of cultural Turkish moments I can recall from my own time living in Turkey—the sincerity of kissing the hand of a respected elder, the obsession with çay, the beauty of the Bosphorus.... Despite my own frustrations with the story of this book, I think Pamuk did a great job at conveying the tumultuous reality of Turkey in the 1980s. 3 stars for Silent House.","Jun 18, 2020"
7004156,Andrew,"This is Pamuk's second novel. It started a bit strange, but once I got used to the style it turned out to be quite a good story. It becomes particularly sinister as it progresses, which I like, and the end is, if not a shocker, then at least surprising. Overall, this is not Pamuk's best, but it does show some of his talent as a writer. I am not as hard on Finn's translation as some readers are. I think he did a pretty decent job.","Oct 13, 2012"
5831184,Teresa,"It's... okay I guess. I mean, some of the characters were interesting – such as Fatma, Faruk, and Redjep – and even the other two – both of them were assholes in a kind of similar way, even if they come from very different backgrounds – but I just wasn't very interested in the plot. I just feel there are tons of things I still don't know about the family. Maybe that's the point, but it's very frustrating sometimes.","Mar 07, 2013"
7170515,Michelle,"Either Pamuk grew tremendously as an author while writing his later novels, or the translator (with whom I'm previously unfamiliar with) cut all of the meat and fat of the Turkish ""Silent House"" with a cleaver, leaving only the bones and some tough sinews. While the aspirations of having each character represented in ""Silent House"" as a voice of the emerging modern Turkish state is interesting, the execution, I suspect in part due to the translation, was ultimately clumsy and unsatisfying.","Mar 27, 2013"
3416893,Carolyn Crocker,"This early novel, about a culture on the cusp of collapse, seen through the lives of one bitterly unhappy and confused family, is almost unbearably sad. But it makes visible the delusions, class envy, frustration,grandiosity, and sense of futility that arose Turkey in 1980 and in the Arab world today. The reader cringes as, in each character's mixed motives and bad decisions, senseless violence becomes inevitable.","Jun 21, 2013"
5761153,Cynthia Sinsap,"This wasn't what I expected. I expected more of the flavor of Turkey. Instead there were individual chapters by the various characters. While the story they told was a good one, I didn't feel there was enough change of voice for each of the characters. I kept having to look at the chapter heading to keep straight which character's story was being told. This may have bee due to the translation rather than the original style.","Aug 12, 2013"
135655,Yasmine,"I've decided to read all of Orhan Pamuk's books that are available in English, in chronological order. This was his second novel, published when he was 30. Not bad, as far as early works go. The kind of stream of consciousness writing that I can get behind, compelling characters equally flawed and sympathetic and some great foresight on his part (back in 1983) on the role that Islamists would play in politics someday.","Aug 28, 2013"
11549992,Chris,"I sometimes wonder what life in Hale, Cheshire would be like if the existing government were replaced by a military coup or a republic.. This novel, set around 1980, gives a glimpse of a society divided into haves and have-nots but slowly torn by internal political strife, the extremists appealing to the poorest and enlisting them as an unpaid force for terror.. I have read many of Pamuk's novels and biographies and yet still have to visit Istanbul - on the bucket list.","Jun 29, 2014"
5971260,Shuk Wah Lee,"The last line gives a perfect end (or as far as I understand what the text intends, a beginning) to the book: ""You can't start out again in life, that's a carriage ride you only take once, but with a book in your hand, no matter how confusing and perplexing it might be, once you've finished it, you can always go back to the beginning; if you like, you can read it through again, in order to figure out what you couldn't understand before, in order to understand life, isn't that so, Fatma?"".","Aug 11, 2014"
3912384,Sarah Furger,"This was not my favorite Pamuk novel. While I really loved most of the characters and the way each character interacts both with each other and with the reader is interesting, for some reason this one did not thrill me the way the others did. Still, there are a few beautiful passages meditating on politics, on hope, and on the purpose of history that really resonated with me. I think I'll come back to this again in the future.","Aug 25, 2014"
29659800,Lana Weshah,"For some reason, I had really high expectations for this book. The language is very bland, it takes forever for a character to get to the point and Hasan, Metin and, to some extent, Faruk are way too similar. I guess the last poin could be excused since Pamuk said something about him being each character. On the other hand, I really enjoyed certain parts of the plot and the voices (although similar) of the characters. I have no idea how should rate this tbh","Jan 13, 2015"
8326936,Saba Aftab,"I don't know why I find Pamuk's books close to my life....!! Loved this one too. The melancholy that life contains, it brings forth describing one's inner fear of loneliness and past memories gushing forth in a way that soothes and at the same time makes you wonder what life really is. Loved the character of Recep especially. The people who are so harmless yet treated either so cruelly in this world of vanity or looked down upon.","Aug 09, 2015"
15528840,Jayant Maini,"The main characters of this story....the grandmother (Fatma).......a dwarf house servant (Recip)........the three grandchildren (Faruk.......Nilgun.....Metin).....and forever lost Hasan will enchant you.....!! But one character that stands out is the ""silent house"".....a house with people......people with stories and stories with people in it....!!! A house that stands tall and fights against the changing the ""traditions""...and...... ""ideology"". I loved the part with Grandmother and Recip.","Jun 03, 2016"
12150359,Bettina,"This is NOT the book Pamuk got the Nobel Prize for and it is no wonder that it took time to come out in translation. The story of a complicated family - or the left overs of a family - grandmother, reclusive in her bedroom mostly, servant, who is a dwarf and, it turns out, connected to the family and three grandchildren, each complicated and failing to make a mark or to succeed. OK..... I am not a literature scholar of course, but again - he wrote MUCH better books.","Aug 14, 2016"
5625540,Burak,"Firstly, I can easily say that it is one of the best books of Orhan Pamuk. I really liked it maybe because I am a melancholic person or Orhan Pamuk does really know how to describe the mood I am in.","Jun 13, 2011"
6037694,Patrdr,"I thought this was a brilliant book. For me it was a slow read, building a gradual sense that something awful would come about.. Pamuk tells the story from multiple perspectives, crossing multiple generations of Turkish history brilliantly.","Dec 08, 2012"
10058407,Tim Dugan,"Somehow made think of The Sound and the Fury. 3.5 might be a more accurate rating.. Of course, beating a child cannot make them into a dwarf. But the author never asserted that explicitly. But it could obviously be the reason the brother was crippled.","Jan 15, 2013"
1845582,Sara,"After listening to 4 out of 10 CDs, I gave up on this book. I didn't care much for the characters which were many and the story was not going anywhere in particular. I am not sure if it was the result of translation or I just could not get into the plot (lack of plot!)","Jun 11, 2013"
861524,Ben Jaques-Leslie,"I've enjoyed other Pamuk books. So I thought, I'd pick up something for a recent trip to Istanbul. I picked wrong. Maybe if I had been in the right mood, I could have gotten into this, but I just was bored.","Jun 12, 2014"
5947142,Janie,"Wow,this book is well-written and each character is fully developed.The uniqueness is that each chapter is from inside each character's head. A brillant and enjoyable read while peeking into Turkish life.","Dec 01, 2014"
21763520,Paul,"** Truly 2.5 stars ** - Though not one of Pamuk's better novels, the book has its moments. Really, there is a passage of time within which the novel's story resides and it is this passage that is the true story.","Jul 20, 2015"
58956902,Stephanie,"Beautiful writing, but the story seemed unfinished. I am currently reading Snow and it almost doesn't seem like the same author.
