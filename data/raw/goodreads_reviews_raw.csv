6743601,Jim Fonseca,"This book is as much about art as it is a historical novel.. First the novel. A tale of miniaturist painters in Istanbul during the late 1500’s. The deceased master’s daughter is in a religious and political limbo: her soldier husband has been missing for four years, but with no body and no witnesses to his death, she can’t get a divorce and move on with her life. She wants to find a new husband and a father for her two young boys and get away from the amorous intentions of her husband’s brother. And there's a murder mystery.. Enter a man called Black, an administrator of sorts who has returned to town after twelve years in distant lands. He still carries a torch for the beautiful widow from his days as a youth. Can he find her father’s killer, keep the brother-in-law at bay, help her get a legal divorce, and win her hand in marriage? Along the way we have blended into the text what are really mini-essays about horses; dogs in the Koran: what it’s like to be a murderer; Satan; the path of a counterfeit coin, etc.. At least half of this lengthy work is about art. (I say lengthy because the 500-page paperback I read was tiny type, so this is a 700- or 800- page book in normal font.) Miniaturist painting was imported into the Ottoman Empire from Persia. Most of the painting was done as pictures in books and to illustrate the borders of pages of books, accompanied by elaborate calligraphy. (Think of the Irish monks’ manuscripts such as the Book of Kells.). Ottoman miniaturist painting was highly stylized. Pictures were drawn from the viewpoint of Allah, from the top of a minaret, and did not use what the West thinks of as true perspective. Armies lined up symmetrically in battle scenes; horses always had the same foreleg raised; a finger placed in a mouth always represented surprise. In accordance with religious concerns about idolatry, faces were generic, not individualized. Who would dare place an identifiable individual at the center of a painting? Man can copy; only Allah can create. The painter tried to portray the ideal horse or chair as Allah created it (think Plato’s “ideal chair”), not the individual variant before them. Is individuality expressed by a traditional miniaturist painter “style” or a “flaw?” Does it offend God?. Compare all this to the European masters at the time such as da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael (the Turks called them “the Venetians”). So a lot of the book is about East meets West in the art world. All in all, an excellent book from the Nobel Prize-winning Pamuk. The story kept my interest and I enjoyed learning about Ottoman art, even when the sections where the miniaturists talked about the philosophy behind painting got repetitive at times.","May 04, 2016"

216890,Darcy,"Generally, when a book starts out with a chapter entitled ""I Am A Corpse,"" you know it's going to be pretty good.. The novel is set up so that each chapter introduces a different narrator, including (but not limited to), Black, Black's uncle, Shekure, a dog, a horse, the murderer and various artists in the workshop. This type of structure for a mystery novel isn't new--Wilkie Collins, for example, employed it several times, most notably in The Moonstone--and it is an effective way to structure a story so as to hide the whodunit. Each character only tells as much as he, she or it knows and in Pamuk's novel even the murderer hides his or her identity.. The structure in ""My Name Is Red,"" though is less designed to sustain suspense and more to allow room for the various philosophical discussions concerning the purpose of art and, perhaps more importantly, the distinctions between Islamic states and Western Europe. The Frankish mode of painting, particularly of portraiture--to glorify the subject, to paint him or her in terms of his/her earthly wealth and power, to distribute such an image openly as a show of control, to demonstrate the creative abilities of the artist--is at the center of these debates and discussions. Black's uncle finds such images alluring and fascinating while others see them as abhorent. Master Osman, for example, sees himself as being forced to choose between the centuries old Islamic traditions he venerates and the more modern and distinctly foreign style he despises. Such a choice is not made easily, as the artists themselves discover. The Frankish method celebrates the individuation of the artist--it prizes the signature of the artist as much as the commissioner of the image. This reverence for the artist, as much as for the piece of art, proves to be a great temptation to the men involved and leads directly to the murder.. The structure, however, also allows for a second discussion, not about art but about writing on art. As much as this is a novel concerning visual images, it is also a novel about ekphrasis--the verbal description of art. Ekphrasis has the effect of slowing down a narrative, of interrupting it. Thus, in Homer's Illiad, the great battle scene is suddenly punctured by a lengthy description of Achilles' shield. Pamuk plays with this model repeatedly. When the image of the horse, described several times in the novel, is given a voice of its own the narrative is not interrupted, but rather the description of the image becomes the narrative. And, moreover, as the image speaks it refutes the fundamental principles underlying Master Osman's devotion to Islamic traditions of art. Pamuk can hardly resist the joke--this is a novel about art in which not a single image appears, except the map at the beginning and the ones we create in our minds as we imagine the images described. But, are we creating an image of the ideal horse, the horse of God, or one we can actually touch, taste, and smell?","Jul 24, 2007"

48483884,Michael Finocchiaro,"This is a fantastic book by Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk which explores the relationship between art and religion ad between imagery and idolatry. Set in the 16th century, we are transported into an Istanbul of the Ottoman empire with a murder mystery told in the voices of the characters (and sometimes these are drawings in the books or just concepts) that inhabit the story. Its primary characters feel very real and the buildup to the big reveal at the end makes the book a real page turner. I think that the story told here is still more than relevant to our world of today given the problems stemming from reading religious texts word for word and building violent systems of repression or terror based on individual interpretations of those readings. Unfortunately, some things have not evolved enough in the last 400 years...A must read.","Aug 23, 2016"

6237864,Nandakishore Varma,"I am in two minds about this book.. Obviously, it is an important work. It showcases the miniaturist tradition of the Islamic world, and uses the cloistered world of miniaturists to explore the difference in philosophies between the East and the West. It was all the more interesting to me because I have been fascinated by this difference ever since I began viewing paintings with serious interest. In the East, ""perspective"" does not exist: the painting flows seamlessy over space and time whereas in the West (especially since the Renaissance) the painting is the reproduction of a particular moment in time (we are not talking of abstractions here). The miniaturist paints the world as God sees it: he does not sign the painting, nor does he have an individual style, because he is unimportant. He continues painting (in fact, he paints better!) after he inevitably goes blind. The Frankish painters, in contrast, paint the world as we see it, which is blasphemy according to some of the miniaturists.. I was captivated by the sweep of the book as well as the way it was presented: short chapters, each from the viewpoint of a different character, as though we were looking at a book of miniatures which tells a different story on each page. Moreover, it is a murder mystery in which the victims as well as the murderer directly speak to the reader! It bears a certain resemblance to ""The Name of the Rose"" in this regard, although Eco's book is much more powerful according to me.. Coming to the minuses: the writing is cumbersome and a task to wade through. I do not know if this is a problem with Pamuk's writing or the translation. The characters are flat: the protagonist (Black) is too weak and cowardly: the heroine (if we can call her that!) too self-centred and manipulative. Maybe the author intended them to be like that, but it does lose reader interest.. I was also rather put off by the amount of lust bubbling on each page. Apart from normal sex (including homosexuality), there is incest, paedophilia, bestiality, fetishism... simmering just beneath the surface. Young boys are regularly presented as objects of lust. Men kiss each other passionately, even when one is about to kill the other! I have heard that Turkey was the centre of ""deviant"" sexual practices during Ottoman times, so maybe it is a true picture, but it did not vibe with me.. (Edit to add: a person has commented that this paragraph is likely to give the impression that I am attacking LGBTQ people, and on reading it again, I find that there is some substance to the accusation. So I have edited it suitably. The whole idea of putting ""deviant"" in quotes was to highlight the dubiousness of the label. However, it was the lust that disturbed me and not the sexual preference. Maybe it is my personal problem, that is why I have noted it down subjectively.). So...adding the negatives and positives, I will go for three stars.","Oct 20, 2011"
94602,Kelly,"My fickle heart longs for the West when I'm in the East and for the East when I'm in the West.. My other parts insist I be a woman when I'm a man and a man when I'm a woman.. How difficult it is being human, even worse is living a human's life.. I only want to amuse myself frontside and backside, to be Eastern and Western both.. This is Pamuk's enduring, never ending obsession. He's written fiction and non-fiction, journal articles and newspaper bites, and given endless interviews on this theme. He's even been thrown in jail and put on trial for the identity he has chosen. He's won the Nobel Prize in Literature for his commitment to expressing his deeply divided mind and spirit, and that (at least he and many others believe) of his country- Turkey. (I apologize in advance if this ends up being something of a ramble through the literary bramble, but I can only say that that would mirror the experience of reading this book.). My Name is Red. will tell you that it is a murder mystery, set in 16th century Istanbul, under the rule of the Sultan. But it will also tell you that it is about many other things, each of which changes, ephermerally, by the moment. The atmosphere of the story digs a little bit into Garcia-Marquez's garden, but storytelling would never be mistaken for his. Each chapter is told by a different voice- some of which are plausible members of a storytelling round, and some of which would really only belong in that category if you were on acid, but they all seem about equally credible, due to the fact that nobody is really credible, so one might as well be fiction or myth as fact. (For instance, we hear from the voices of the drawing of a horse, the fake voice of a woman who is actually a man, a gold piece and the color red.) It is ethereal, elusive, and there isn't one incarnation of the mind that can be trusted here. Don't fall into the trap of assuming that what you read has anything to do with anything other than the particular pyschology of the moment- Pamuk is a master of depicting the every day track of a mind, and how unreliable each feeling of a moment is- how everything important is changed by the fact that one just happens to feel hungry at a particular moment, or desperately horny at another. It is an absolute masterwork of insight on the psychology of a particular people at a particular time, and all the various reasons why they are that way, and yet he is able to make them as relatable as possible through it all.. What struck me the most throughout the entire book was how terrified, it seemed, that Pamuk was of missing something. While other authors might be striving to become masters of literature, masters of form, I think Pamuk wished that he could be nothing so much as a master of tapestry-making. I think he would die happy if he could have given this book to the theoretical Weaver in the sky and gotten it back as a divine scrap of worked fabric. There are lists upon lists upon lists of endless things that go on for pages, only to stop and start up once again. As a part of his contradictory feelings towards the West, in a culture whose stories and traditions often originated in the East... although he longs for the West, he's terrified, just as his characters are, that everything they know from the East will disappear. It seems like he can't stop himself- there's some sort of driving fear if he doesn't list everything about history and culture and myth, and repeat all the stories again and again to make sure we remember what they are, it will be gone forever. His expression of ambivalence towards Western culture perfectly expresses the mindset of illuminators in 16th century Istanbul terrified that their entire lives are about to become irrelevant.. The other absorbing, fascinating, and horrifying thing was how well Pamuk illustrates the idea that absolutely nobody speaks with their own voice, both through his painters, constrained by centuries of adherance to a perfect style that some random master brought out of Baghdad that depicts the ""perspective of Allah."" It is considered heresy and a fault to have a ""style"", and ""signatures"" are furitively hidden away as much as possible- the idea that blindness is the ideal to be obtained for these artists is just heartbreaking- at least to someone coming at it from a Western perspective, where seeing painters deliberately rob themselves of their sight, their most precious commodity, over and over again, in the course of obtaining a meaningless idea of perfection that is not their own. The murderer throughout this book strives endlessly to hide himself by speaking in a voice that does not at all resemble how we see him in other places. The majority of people who are speaking a themselves tell stories in order to express their feelings- in fact at the beginning all the suspected illuminators speak almost entirely in story form in order to answer any important question on any philosophical, religious, or even personal topic. Expressing one's feelings just isn't done. One doesn't go up to the pretty boy one would like to fuck and tell him so, one tells him a parable about a gorgeous boy in order to show your admiration for him. Much as the pictures are seen as the ""perspective of Allah,"" it seems that there is only one way to speak, too, in the ""words of Allah,"" or those stories which are sanctioned by the authorities as legitimate- the authority of Allah on earth. It was the ultimate tragedy of the book from the Western perspective, and the ultimate triumph of the book from the accepted ides of the time, all of these de-individualized people (as much as can be done or denied or pushed from sight) striving towards the goal of seeing as Allah does, ever in the correct way.. But everyone recognizes the end of the ""Eastern"" way of life coming from the West, in the guise of the ""Venetian"" ways that everyone will want to slavishly follow in the future, ways which reactionary preachers and religious people are protesting against before they've even made serious headway, trying to keep their way of life ""pure."" But the rest of the book poitns out again and again that there is no way that the culture of the Ottoman Empire was pure in any way- no constantly conquering culture with a large army and a long reach could ever be. No autocratic society that entailed artisans, craftsman and soldiers to pick up and serve someone else once their lord was defeated (if they weren't killed out right) could develop in isolation without any influence from the outside. He shows globalization already happening, back in the 16th century, and how deep the effects penetrate then and now.. I loved his. Istanbul. for his brilliant evocation of identity, living with a burdensome past and an uncertain future, for its poetry and its memory.. My Name is Red. accomplishes much the same thing, with more magic- but just enough dirt to bring it right straight home where it belongs in 2009.","Jul 15, 2009"
5431458,Henry Avila,"During nine snowy, cold, winter days in the fabulous city of Istanbul the capital of the Ottoman Empire, at its height in the reign of Sultan Murat 111 there occurred a brutal murder, (not the last one ) the year 1591. At the bottom of an abandoned well the mangled body of Elegant Effendi nicknamed Red, a miniaturist who had worked for the Sultan is found but not before the corpse tells his sad story. How the victim was lured by a person which was thought a close friend, with promises of riches and savagely attacked. Strangely the spirit is contented and feels no anger now. Just looking forward to the new world paradise, in heaven. He was a talented painter along with Stork, Olive, and Butterfly under old Master Osman who gave them all their aliases, taught the boys everything they know including beatings, when mistakes were made ( all surprisingly love their master, of 25 years) in a workshop funded by the revered sovereign. Colorful paintings of bright glorious colors of horses , trees, clouds, important people slaughter on many battlefields, fables, enchanting gardens under the exotic illuminating moon with lovers looking tenderly at each other . Red was uneasy about a secret project he worked on because of the foreign, Venetian styled illustrations forbidden by Islam many believe, later when completed these small paintings will be put in a book, to be viewed only by the ruler and a few trusted associates ... Black (Kara) a clerk, secretary, and occasional warrior hired by pashas fighting endless wars against the Persians, returns to his hometown of Istanbul after twelve long years. A failed romance cause him much suffering, the reason for his volunteered exile. The beauty Shekure his uncle's Enishte daughter, was constantly on his mind the lonely days spent thinking about his cousin wanderings through the vast hot deserts and freezing temperatures in the dizzy , elevations of towering mountains sleeping in pungent tents in isolated locations. The rejection of a marriage proposal by his own uncle for his love, and her wedding to another a famous soldier he can never forget. But her husband has been missing for four years, she with two small children living at her father's house and the army has come back. A second chance for happiness if only Black can win her affections... Still he has very strong competition, from fierce Hasan younger brother of Shekure's fearless husband. Esther a shrewd Jewish peddler, matchmaker , and messenger for clandestine sweethearts she knows everything about everyone, having walked over all the city's streets begins bringing letters to Shekure and Black and Hasan too. Rumors that the killer is a miniaturist sweeps the city. Black had been one in his youth, with the three remaining master painters before quitting. And the angry Sultan wants the murderer caught in three days, or torture will commence on the suspects every miniaturist ...","Dec 18, 2013"
5407952,Jibran,"Arguably the best novel of Orhan Pamuk. Set in Istanbul during the height of Ottoman power, this novel is a tribute to the art of painting as well as a fascinating murder mystery which will keep you hooked till the end. The unusual narrative is felt with full force right from the start - as you read the first chapter, starting with the voice of a corpse at the bottom of the well wondering who was the wretched man that killed him.. Then ensues a beautiful exploration of the 16th century Istanbul's art scene, its many rivalries, and in between breaths a heartfelt love story that keeps the main protagonist on his heels, as he finds his way through the internecine politics at home and at court. This story is a fascinating example of the possibilities of modern global novel. Must read.","Feb 24, 2014"

When a student of mine, aged 15, stormed into the library and declared this was the best book ever, I felt strangely sad I hadn't thought more about it since I read and loved it some years ago. When the same student grabbed the next Orhan Pamuk novel she could find on the shelf, an innocent brick of a museum novel, I even felt jealous, as I hadn't read that one yet and I bizarrely envied her the first touch of a Pamuk novel - while at the same time being incredibly grateful he writes and reaches the next generation. A rare gift. I remember developing a passion for miniature painting while reading My Name Is Red, and it has stayed with me since, even through the times when I barely remembered the book itself..

1036893,Fabian,"I could not help but think of the film ""Daisies"" (“Sedmikrasky,” dir. Vera Chytilova), that shameless classic of the Czech New Wave while reading Ohran Pamuk’s My Name is Red. That brilliant & psychedelic film of the 60’s portrays two incessant, silly girls who seem to want to emphasize their existence by playing pranks on other people and being undeniably obnoxious. They are terrified at the idea of being forgotten—of not existing. Similarly, in Pamuk’s epic novel of conspiring miniaturists, of love and death, the reader is confronted with the theme of existence. There is an unknown presence which strives to be part of the reader’s consciousness—which, like the two unremitting, adolescent & undeniably-alive individuals of the film, tries its hardest to appear, to become known & acknowledged.. My Name is Red has a radical structure. As I read more and more books, it becomes increasingly clear that some writers take an enormous amount of effort in establishing a frame, a “cabinet of curiosities” (in the same tradition as MVL’s “Chinese boxes” and “communicating vessels) in which to properly display their creations. For example, A. S. Byatt, in her Booker-prize winning novel ""Possession,"" a novel that is more poetry book than a novel, creates several frames in which to place all the poetry which two poets keep exchanging as tokens of their love. Byatt obviously wants to make her poetry accessible, and gives it further clout by giving each poet his or her unique voice—by fully creating two different minds. Pamuk also uses the novel to display his craft, establishing a museum in which to showcase his “paintings”: his cabinet of curiosities includes, not poems, but individual vignettes, brush-stroke tableaus which represent but one facet of a full universe. The conglomeration of these makes up the bulk—gives the reader the voice, the theme & style—of the novel.. “If I could only,” the nameless murderer tells Enishte Effendi, “see the last picture in its entirety” (158). Both the character’s expectations and the reader’s match—their journey is, therefore, genuinely entwined. The reader wants to know what all these different vignettes will culminate in. The wants of a fictional character and those of an actual live reader are the one and the same—this is the main catalyst which moves the narrative to its awesome conclusion. The reader is prepared to sift through the surplus of stories, images, and motifs to get to the bottom of this radical love story/murder mystery. Enishte Effendi admits: “They say we’ve committed an unforgivable sin by daring to draw, from the perspective of a mangy street dog, a horsefly and a mosque as if they were the same size” (158). Virginia Woolf’s literary sense of character democracy, of consciousness-equality, is pretty much Pamuk’s own. By depicting various POVs, by making them authentic and articulate, Pamuk seems to rationalize like many of the great writers that every tiny aspect of the plot is essential—only with all of these different takes on the same thing (the murder of Elegant and the love story of Black and Shekure) can the reader get a faithful interpretation of such enormous complexity and chaos.. There is a consciousness which ties the characters together, and it is perhaps the force of life itself. The crazy girls perturb the status quo when they admit that they want to live (live!) in Daisies. The different entities (whether they be annoying Shekure or the talking picture of a dog, or literally, the color red) all possess life and they indulge the reader in their personal and unique elucidations on life in 16th-century Istanbul. The added element, that is, all the writer’s own beliefs in art (writing is aptly compared to painting) are present in Red, and the work transcends not only the rules of storytelling by having such incredibly different characters in it with such unique voices, but also because it dabbles with the postmodern idea of reading about art within a work of art.. All that being said, there is a grave problem with the pacing of the book--it took me forever to complete this (and lets face it, Gone With the Wind this is not). Also, there is a ceaseless amount of repetition of events, a constant reassurance that seems extraneous-- a recompilation of different occurrences voiced by the different (though extremely intriguing) characters. The themes, rich in the context of the production of art, are very appropriate and very revolutionary. This is a postmodern work which of course still lingers on the romantic, and then plays around some with the detective novel genre.","Oct 01, 2012"
425220,Lissa,"I tried very hard to really like this book. But, I suppose it's impossible to succeed in everything.. My Name Is Red is both historical fiction and a murder mystery. It takes place in 1591 (according to the timeline at the end of the book). The over-arching motion of the plot centers around the death of a master miniturist in the Sultan's court. The death is revealed in the first chapter, though the reasons surrounding the his death are much slower in being revealed. What is known, almost at the outset, is that his death is related to a book that the Sultan has commission that is to be illustrated in the European style, with respect to perspective and a view of the world as an actual person sees it (as opposed to how Allah would see it). Enishte Effendi, the person in charge of the manuscript, calls his childhood apprentice Black Effendi back from Persia to Istanbul to help investigate the murder and help him finish the Sultan's book. Within this overarching plot is the plight of Enishte's daughter Shekure, whose husband went to war four years prior and never came back. Black has been pining away for her during his twelve year absence from Istanbul, though he is not the only man who is interested in becoming her new husband. Amongst the plot and subplot, there are multiple discussions of style and individualism and what it means to be a father/father-figure, among other topics.. The story is told in a sort of Faulkner-esque fashion, with each chapter being told in the perspective of different characters in the story. These characters are sometimes alive, and sometimes dead (as in the first chapter entitled ""I am a corpse""). Also, sometimes the chapters are told in the sort-of perspective of the drawing from Enishte's book - I say sort of, because they're really told from the perspective of a coffee house storyteller who is pretending to be what is depicted in Enishte's book. Are you confused yet?. The was my first issue with this book: at the beginning, it's very confusing. Not knowing a lot about the Muslim faith, it took many chapters before I figured out what exactly was wrong with the way Enishte wanted to illustrate his manuscript. My second problem with this book was all of the exposition. There is too much time spent on the exposition on topics like love and style that are obliquely connected with the plot. Certainly these expositions add greater depth to the different characters, but after a while it started to get a little tedious. Thirdly, Pamuk does not inhabit his different narrators in the way that David Mitchell (Ghostwritten, Cloud Atlas) manages to. As a result, the book feels a little bit flat. Fourthly, the subplot with Shekure adds very little to the book. I found her to be an incredibly unappealing character, and I found myself wishing that the murderer would murder her next.. All of that being said, the book does have a certain flair to the writing. Some of the exposition is really thought-provoking. I also thought that the stories told from the perspective of drawings and corpses and even colors were interesting additions to the plot. In sum, I'm not sorry I read it, but I was expecting more out of it.","Sep 26, 2007"
56939723,Samra Yusuf,"I believe in the fact that there is nothing as fact, everything the eye beholds is the individual reality of the beholder, what the eye sees and mind translates it as sight is a phenomenon of individual perception, and this is where the artist discerns himself from a mere beholder, he is, simultaneously a beholder and a creator, or we may say the re-creator, his strokes alive the scenery, his colors spark the stars, his art immortals the mortality of life, and his hands vouchsafe timelessness to the time bound. And such an artist, is a blatant sinner in the eyes of Islam, as Allah is the sole creator, and to create is his attribute only, and to impersonate this attribute an act of sacrilege! And Orhan took 700 plus pages to indispensably say this.. Its sixteenth century Istanbul, pinnacle of ottoman rule, a book of illustrations is in the making, the contents of the book are being kept secret until it completes, as the Sultan demands. One of the four makers of book is found murdered at the pit of well with cause of murder and murderer unknown, following another murder of the in charge of the whole work Enishte Effendi by the hands of same murderer in same manner, and a good 500 pages wrap the further happenings.. The novel’s busting with plots within plots, history, mystery, art, education, philosophy, love, lost, you just name it, and all it lacks is grip on reader and the inspiration to move on, or in the very least drag on, I believe Orhan is not the sole creator of this concoction of a thing novel, translator has done the job on equal ground, but translation alone doesn’t grind the gears, it’s the whirlwind of infinity narrative voices you find yourself blown up with, or we might correctly say swipe away with, characters are as flat as a scale, and never did I read anything this lackluster on the subject of art. I am inclined to believe all Pamuk aimed through this, was the encomium to the lost art of Islamic illumination, if it could only had not been with this dry voice..huh!","Dec 13, 2017"
1415047,Whitaker,"Some stories sink their teeth into your gut and don't let go. Others offer more cerebral pleasures (works by Borges comes to mind). This is more the second than the first, and I'm okay with that.. First and foremost, there are quite a few chapters in this book that read more like a chapter in a book on the history of Islamic illuminations than a chapter in a novel. In this respect, however, Pamuk can legitimately point to past antecedents in this vein: Tolstoy for one in. War and Peace. , Melville for another in. Moby Dick. . Me, I. liked. reading about the art of Islamic miniatures.. Secondly, and perhaps most crucially, this is. not. a novel about a crime set in the workshops of the Ottoman Sultan's miniaturists. Uh huh, I know what the blurb says. It's not. That's just the setting. The real jewel in the crown is the eulogy, the encomium to the lost art of Islamic illumination.. And that's what fired me up. That, and the fact that it's not. just. a novel about this fabulous lost art, it's a novel that seeks to. replicate. that art in the form of a novel and, by doing so, to bring us closer to understanding the tragedy of its loss.. Take a look at that picture above. It's an example of Islamic miniature art. Actually, it's an image of a great love story in Islamic literature. Look at it. And I mean REALLY look at it. See the contours of the man's face, the details of the landscape; notice the flatness and odd perspective of the scene; revel in the colours.. This image was produced and reproduced hundreds of thousands of times by different unknown artists in more or less the same way. This image was poured over by aficionados who would know the story by heart, who would even have memorized what the different elements making up the scene should look like.. This is not an image that can be taken in with a single cursory glance--""Oh pretty,"" you say, ""Next!"" That would be anathema to the ethos of the art. It wasn't even supposed to be a stand-alone image, but a decorative element in a book telling the story of the two lovers.. Look at that image. Not the story it tells, but the artistic elements, the ideas about the world embodied in it. That little piece of art is this book, and this book is that little piece of art. And when I finished the book, I mourned the loss of that art. Brilliant!","Aug 09, 2009"

8641338,Fiona,"It's a rare pleasure to read a book so richly layered. Contained within what is essentially a murder mystery is the history of Islamic art, miniaturists in particular, and its clash with European (Frankish) art in the late 15th/early 16th centuries, romance, a social history of Istanbul at that time, religious extremism, a seditious storyteller in a coffeehouse, Ottoman history, multiple parables and historic tales bathed in myth.. Pamuk tells the story through many different voices, each giving their perspective on events as they unfold and bizarrely including the murdered telling the tales of their own deaths. There was a point, probably 4/5ths of the way through, when the endless intricacies of Islamic representations of horses in particular began to pall (Dear Orhan, we get the message already!) but what I loved was the way in which the author makes us 'see' and think about this art form in its many different settings. He made me think quite deeply about visual artistry which is not something I'm prone to do very often (I'm too lazy).. I swithered whether to give this 4.5 or 5 stars. The translation of this edition is clunky. It's written in American English, e.g. the translator uses the word 'ornery' a lot which is meaningless on this side of the pond, and he uses abbreviations that a native speaker wouldn't ordinarily put into print, e.g. I'd've. I can't mark a book down for its translation though, just this edition. Although the descriptions of artworks were at times overly lengthy and the number of parables became a little bit tedious at times, I have to give it 5 stars simply because it is a luscious book overall and one that I have enjoyed losing myself in over the last few days.","Dec 30, 2016"
21432277,Supratim,"I had heard a lot of praises for My Name is Red by the Turkish author Orhan Pamuk and the book had been on my TBR for a long time before I finally got a chance to read it.. The story is set in the end of the sixteenth century in the city of Istanbul, the capital of the mighty Ottoman Empire. The Sultan of Turkey has commissioned a book in secret and one of the miniaturists working on the project is murdered. It won’t be the only murder of course!. miniaturist - A painter of miniatures or an illuminator of manuscripts. The main character of this novel is called Black. He had to drop out of a miniaturist workshop and leave Istanbul because he had the audacity to profess his life for his uncle’s daughter, Shekure. Anyway Black has finally returned and is still in love with Shekure, now a mother of two and whose husband went missing in a war.. There are rumours that the miniaturists, working under the supervision of Black’s uncle, had been imitating the styles of the “infidel” Franks in the secret book, and thus committing blasphemy.. The book has some elegant writing and the author has done an excellent job of fleshing out the complex characters. The narrative is also full of parables through which the characters would clarify and reinforce their beliefs on art and religious morality. The author has skillfully portrayed the various emotions and feelings of the humans – love, lust, fear, envy, bigotry,greed.. While reading this book, I couldn’t help comparing it with The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco. By coincidence, I had purchased these two books on the same day. Since I had read book by Eco very recently it was still somewhat fresh in my mind and I could see the similarities and dissimilarities as well. I later saw that many readers have compared the two books. Both the books are historical fictions with multiple murders, though based in different countries and cultures. The Name of the Rose is around the Christian beliefs whereas My Name is Red talks about the Islamic view around art. The former had long discussions on religious beliefs in general while the latter dwelled at length on the religious morality and its impact on art particularly illustration and painting.. The murders in both the novels revolved around books because some individuals considered the content to be blasphemous.. The Name of the Rose was narrated by a single person while there are multiple POVs in My Name is Red, the living or even the dead get to tell their story.. The story plotted by Eco mostly revolved around monks but Pamuk’s novel gave a voice to people from different sections of the society. There was a feeling of suffocation in The Name of the Rose (due to the strict atmosphere of an abbey), but in case of My Name is Red, though there was fear, I felt the feeling of suffocation was less intense – probably because it was set in the outside world where people talked about art and love.. The book was a novel experience for me for it was my first book about Turkey. I learnt a bit about a new culture – their history, beliefs, mythology and way of life.. I enjoyed reading the book, but at times the narrative dragged so much – I was getting bored with the love triangle involving Black, Shekure and Hasan, Shekure’s brother-in-law. The long discussions on the morality and integrity of Ottoman art, though well written, were getting tiresome.. If you want a fast paced crisp thriller, then this book is not for you. But, if you don’t mind a historical fiction with lots of pages devoted to art and beliefs, then you can give it a try.. I am giving the book a rating of 3.5! I have deducted 0.5 because the narrative dragged so much at times.","Sep 09, 2018"
140255,Leslie,"Saying I liked it or didn't like it doesn't really capture the complexity of my experience with this book. Part murder mystery, part love story, and part historical novel about the book-art in the ottoman empire....I thought it was right up my alley. Maybe I expected to have more of an emotional connection but it was all very intellectual and somehow that frustrated me...churned up my stomach which was quite contented on the diet of all-fluff, all-the-time. Reading this was like eating roasted beets with rosemary---good for me but i prefer something sweeter, and smoother.. OK, here's my beef:. It often felt like reading a genealogy of islamic stories and historical books which I found tiring; though sitting in the vault of the sultan and perusing these books would be incredible for me, reading about the rich visual imagery was tedious.. I constantly felt like there was something I couldn't access because I don't have the specific background knowledge; but I still can't even form the questions I need for deeper connection. I had the impression that the stories recounted over and over would be mundane (in a comforting way), familiar and meaningful for people from that culture they weren't for me.. The murder mystery kept me reading because I wanted to find out who did it but resentfully, because i kept losing track of the author's clues while trudging through the endless philosophizing.. The conversations about the place of art and artists in relation to their funders, influences, and the contemporary culture; the ways representation can be slippery and dangerous; the questions surrounding seeing, perception, blindness, and divine inspiration vs. a skillful hack job--- all of these are fascinating and relevant to me but such a dry dry dry voice.. And the love story was pffff... like looking through a snow globe at some scenery you couldn't touch.","Aug 02, 2007"
5237420,Ana ,"It's not often you find books that start with the speech of an already dead character. It's actually pretty damn rare to find dead bodies speaking at all, wouldn't you agree? Well, Pamuk apparently didn't get the memo. Because that is exactly how his wonderful work, ""My Name is Red"", starts.. The body of ""Elegant"" Effendi is rotting in a well, somewhere in Istanbul. During life, he was a miniaturist, an artistry that is usually found in Ottoman books, and his talent was known as one of the best of his days, hence the nick-name ""Elegant"". His carcass, decaying in its crumpled position on the bottom of that well, tells the reader that he has been murdered, and demands that his killer be found. He dreams of the tortures that the one who ended his life will suffer. A four-days old mort dreams of vengeance.... The next thing you notice in the book is that every chapter is constructed around a single, individual character. This means that the reader's perspective resembles that of a God, looking through different sets of eyes at the same image. This over-seeing that you are burdened with in the beginning becomes a kind of judging position, as you, as a passive by-stander, are integrated in the story. You slowly become the one who is looking for the murderer. You have three that might be killer-fabric: Olive, Butterfly and and Stork. At one point, one of them deceives himself through his unique painting style. Also, the human characters are not the only ones who speak through the chapters; Death itself talks about how she roams the streets of Istanbul, a tree drawn by a miniaturist tells the story of his creation, a coin of their time talks about its journey through many pockets etc. Through the ""lifeless"" characters of this work, you understand not only the art of miniaturists (with the help of the tree drawing), but the whole world itself, the setting in which you are bound to live for as long as you read Pamuk's writing.. I think there are three major lines in this book: the quest to find Elegant Effendi's murderer, the love story between Black and Shekure and the creation of a book that Black was commissioned to do.. Black is a miniaturist and a binder, who just returned to Istanbul after 12 years as a free worker in different realms of our world. He is, at the moment of the story, 36 years old, but is also presented as a young 24 year old man who fell in love with the then 12-year-old Shekure, daughter of Black's uncle, Enishte Efendi. Even after 12 years spent away, even if her face might have faded from his mind, Black understands that the love of his life is her and that he is capable of doing anything to have Shekure next to him. Nothing is an impediment in his quest: even the fact that she is already married seems to be just a minor problem on their way. He sets out to win her, and is in the process taken under the wing of her father, Enishte Efendi, who tells him that he has to work on an ample book of pictures celebrating the magnificent world that they live in, but in the ""Frank"" style, which is what they would call European figurative painting.. This is where the story of the book intertwines with the story of the two characters' love, because if he wants Shekure, Black must finish the book.. Because of the Islam religion, figurative art is considered a blasphemy, as, and I quote: ""Islam allows to portray a picture as Allah sees it to be"". In the setting of this book, which is Istanbul of 1591, a year before the 1000th anniversary of the Hegire (Mohammed's exile from Mecca to Medina), Ottoman culture seems to have been changed by this individual approach to art. They are not permitted to create things as they see them, but rather as they should ideally and hypotethically be seen by their God, Allah. This European style that Black and others have to work in is a blasphemous act, therefore it was done in the utmost secrecy, always in fear that they should be discovered. It is this particular action that shows how culture can be changed by introducing a new viewpoint in art - this time, in painting.. Speaking of painting: this whole book is probably one of the most competent explanations of how art, and especially miniaturist painting here, evolved. It talks about how it is the most important possible work, as it lasts through centuries and shows people what their history looked like. It talks about the miniaturist's blessing and curse, becoming blind towards the end of his life, when he can paint more beautifully than ever, because he sees through the eyes of his mind, of his soul. A detail therefore, becomes the image and the image becomes the detail, as they are so intertwined that you can't separate them. And still, with all the mighty human painters, time is this art's master. A lot of detail work has been put into this book, and the magnitude of the descriptions is rarely to be found in writing, these days. Like Mo Yan, Pamuk deserves his 2006 Nobel Prize; his unique style is a light seam through the cloth of life, culture, humanity, heart, mind and soul of Creation, and he writes beautifully about what he thinks is important.. And there are so many moments in this book that are pure joy for the attentive reader! It sometimes touches on how love might be a curse, a rope around the lover's neck, obliging him to thread lightly on silky footsteps around this dangerous animal of a feeling, and it sometimes talks about love as if it is the noblest of the feelings and the only paradise that man can aspire at. ""My Name is Red"" touches on problems of marriage and sexual frustration and the dehumanization of the sexual act, how it can be just a mindless, void moment, rather than an union between two beings who love each other. It debates religion, spirituality, cultural identity, death, infinity and so many more other themes that most of the writers are not capable of even integrating in their work, let alone attempt to explain them.. Another recommendation made by my History teacher, yet another one I thank him for. Cheers!","Feb 19, 2014"
257105,Ayu Palar,"‘To God belongs the East and the West’ – Al-Qur’an, Al Baqarah ayat 115.. I had abandoned. My Name is Red. for how long I can’t remember. The brilliance of it was untouched, what a shame. But after reading. Other Colours. (an amazing essay collection also by Orhan Pamuk), I thought I should give Mr. Pamuk another shot, and boy, how much I enjoyed the novel! And I understand why Pamuk deserves the Nobel prize. He’s the kind of writer that can bring out the cultural richness but at the same time using it to promote world peace.. My Name is Red. is a brightly rich novel. The main plot is a murder mystery of a miniaturist in Turkey, but what makes this novel is different is that Pamuk mixes it with other interesting elements: a passionate love story, devotion to art and the cultural clash between the East and the West. At first, I didn’t think the love story was significant enough, but well, it turns out the love conflict has an important role for the ending.. Still not interesting enough for you? Well, let’s see. Inspired by Virginia Woolf, Pamuk loves to make an unusual plotline. The story is delivered through many points of view. Not only the humans, Pamuk also gives voices to unliving things, like a gold coin and a corpse. In fact, it is the corpse that opens the story of the novel. Now you won’t call it ordinary, eh? Pamuk even gives a chance for the murderer to say something. This technique might tire some readers, however it provides the thriller until the end.. The thing that kinda bothers me is that the last chapter of Shekure. I personally think the chapter isn’t too strong to close the novel. If I were Pamuk, I would close it by using Master Osman’s point of view. I’d like to know what his reaction is after knowing who the killer is. But all in all,. My Name is Red. is a splendid work of art. I just hope no one will make a film of it. I truly believe it won’t capture the magnificence of this novel.","Oct 24, 2008"
4693,Ali,"It’s not a historical, though there is sort of history in it (Istanbul, Ottoman Empire, 1591). The mystery death of two master miniaturists doesn’t make it a murder mystery novel either. It’s not a philosophical novel though there are lots of discussions about illusrtation in European style concerning perspective, and traditional Eastern illustrating, which sees the world in the way Allah would see it.. What amazed me is, how Pamuk has taken a now forbiden discussion, to 5 centuries back, to stablish a better situation to discuss about tabus, concerning the distinctions between Islamic states and Western Europe. It's how the so-called Islamic style of illuminating lost it’s values to the so-called Frankish mode of painting, painting the earthly wealth, rather than images of what God creates on earth. In another word, demonstrating the creative abilities of the artist (European style) which Enishte effendi finds fascinating is forbiden in Islam, as if it’s kind of competing with God in creation. That’s why some other master miniaturists kill him to not loose their stabilities and honour as artists. It means that those who are not seeing the realilty of life and human being (idealists) are going to loose their style and power. This describes the restrained violence of the culture clashes which are so relevant to our world at this time through the allegory of artistic expression as European manner of representing the world, and that of the Islamic faith, in the novel!. اگرچه وقایع داستان در دوران عثمانی (1591) می گذرد اما نمی شود گفت ""تاریخی""ست. جنایی هم نیست اگرچه وقایع حول و حوش دو قتل اتفاق می افتد. و اگرچه بحث، بیشتر در مقایسه ی دو شیوه ی هنری، مینیاتور جهان اسلام و نقاشی ونیزی یا مکتب فرانسوی ست، اما رمان در مورد فلسفه ی هنر هم نیست. یعنی نه آنقدر تاریخ در آن هست و نه فلسفه و نه جنایت. اهمیت اساسی در لایه ی دوم رمان است، همان گونه که در ""برف""، رمان دیگر پاموک. دغدغه ی فکری پاموک مساله ی جاری زمان ماست، مقایسه و تقابل جهان اسلام و سنت از یک سو و جهان غرب و مدرنیته در سوی دیگر. مساله ای که ذهن اغلب روشنفکران در جهان اسلام را به خود مشغول داشته. انتخاب دو شکل تصویر سازی در دو جهان، به دلیل فلسفه ای که در پس ساختار مینیاتور (یک بعدی بودن آن و پرهیز از خلق دوباره ی جهان) و هنر نقاشی غربی (دید سه بعدی هنرمند از جهان) وجود دارد، انتخاب بسیار ظریف و استادانه ای ست از سوی پاموک، برای نشان دادن تقابل میان دو گونه تفکر در جهان معاصر، یکی سنتی و اقتدارگرا و دیگری مدرن و دموکرات. یکی در فراموشی انسان در مقابل خدا و دیگری در اهمیت به انسان به عنوان هسته ی اصلی جامعه ی بشری. با انتخاب زمان تاریخی در گذشته، پاموک این فرصت را به خود داده تا در مورد بسیاری از ""تابوها""ی امروز در جوامع اسلامی، به راحتی و در کمال آزادی صحبت کند.","Sep 27, 2007"

6753400,Gabrielle,"Historical murder mystery and reflection on religion, love and death: Mr. Pamuk is pretty ambitious, telling us the story of a man who returns to Istanbul after twelve years away, and is asked to undertake a very dangerous work, reconnect with a lost love and solve the mystery of a man’s death. But this is not simply a very unusual “whodunit”; it’s a complex portrait of a great city at a moment of intense upheaval at the end of the 16th century. The East and the West were becoming reacquainted with each other culturally and commercially, challenging their mutual worldviews and values.. In the Ottoman Empire, representative art was forbidden for religious reasons. The Quran condemned the reproduction of a living being’s image as idol worship, and to glorify the subject of the painting, or the individuality of the artist, was a grievous sin. But since the very nature of an artist is to see the world slightly differently, not all of the painters and miniaturists of Istanbul agreed with the idea of purely abstract representation. Some have traveled to Italy, seen the work of foreign masters and begun to think of their work and their world differently. But some deeply religious people will continue to think of representative art as sacrilege, no matter who commissions the work…. “My Name is Red” is built like one of the mosaics described in the story: like vignettes that would be meaningless by themselves, but that make a rich and grand picture once they are assembled. Each chapter is narrated by a different character; some that we encounter over and over again, and others that we only see once. This gives you a kaleidoscopic view of the story and while the execution is not perfect (and I’m not sure how much of that can be chalked up to translation), it is still a damn impressive literary device! And the little meta-wink at the end was a very nice touch!. The constantly changing POV can be a bit confusing. Again, maybe the original Turkish text was clearer on that, but in the French translation I read, some characters’ voices are hard to tell apart from each other. So if those characters get to rambling about specific cultural details that are not quite relevant to the plot it can get frustratingly tempting to just skim…. This book is really for art and history nerds. If you are not interested in the restrictions imposed by religion on artists to make sure that their work couldn’t be turned into idol worship by the people who would see it, you might find this tedious. If you think philosophical debates about the purpose of art are cool, and you like long conversations about stylistic differences, then you might find this book fascinating. I’ve heard it compared to “The Name of the Rose” in terms of complexity, depth of research and social commentary. I’ve also heard the same warning applied to both books: they are long, intricately detailed and can get very heavy and tedious. I don’t think that such criticism is too far off in the case of “My Name is Red”, but I don’t think that should discourage serious readers from diving in.. I rated it 3 and half stars because I won’t be tempted to re-read this one later (I tend to re-read books I have enjoyed reading, and I can’t say I was having fun with this one), but there’s no doubt in my mind that it’s an important book that deserves the effort.","Sep 20, 2017"
1173554,Steve,"I loved this book. It's passionate, provocative and intelligent, surprisingly bringing the field of 16th-century miniaturist painting to bear on aesthetic and ethical issues that seem urgent (at least for artists) today. The main concern is with the notion of 'style' in art: is it desirable to have a personal style as an artist or are traces of style simply evidence of faults? In the process of investigating this question we discover the more fundamental question: what constitutes 'style'? Characters in the novel approach these questions philosophically, but the characters' positioning within a story makes for a much richer account than a philosophical treatise on the subject could give. The characters have their views on style, but at the same time they are actors – fiercely competitive ones – and any account of their actions according to their philosophical beliefs would be mere theorizing. Two murders and one wedding occur alongside such diverse attempts at explanation by the participating characters as to defy rational accounts of motivation.. Each chapter shifts the first-person narrative to a different character in the story, some of whom even conceal their own voice while narrating. The opening chapter 'I Am a Corpse' gives just the bold shock needed for a book on the seemingly genteel subject of miniature painting.. Hope to read the whole book again, among other reasons in order better to learn the Middle Eastern history contained here from the perspective of Turkey.","Aug 22, 2009"

5558460,Caterina,"A rich layer cake of a novel. Given the complexity and intensity of ideas explored, I found myself wishing that Pamuk had taken a more Proustian, plotless deep-dive rather than trying to force it to be a murder mystery. The explorations of art and ideas fascinated me, and I cared about the complex main characters Shekure and Black and the rocky path of their love relationship. But the middle of the book dragged. Over-writing was a factor, but the biggest drag was the distracting ruse of having to solve a mystery. I just did not care at all who the murderer was! We never really got to know or care about any of the three suspects, they just seemed like a framework to explore art and ideas: the religious, sexual, and power dynamics from which great art sprung.. My fickle heart longs for the West when I'm in the East and for the East when I'm in the West.. My other parts insist I be a woman when I'm a man and a man when I'm a woman.. How difficult it is being human, even worse is living a human's life.. I only want to amuse myself frontside and backside, to be Eastern and Western both.. -- from the narrative of a cross-dressing storyteller who performs in the café, an artistic, political and social center for men that is endangered by religious repression. Pamuk seemed especially interested in, and good at, exploring mixed feelings, ambivalence, multivalence, indecision between multiple viewpoints -- one of my favorite literary topics. The ideals versus perceived realities of love and marriage. The paradoxical effects of religious repression, competition with the West, and contradictory ideas about representation in art. The apprentice system that fostered both great art and rampant sexual abuse of boys by their teachers, the conflicted memories of those artists.. One flaw: the discussions of Venetian versus Ottoman art seemed to be predicated on inaccurate ideas about Western art history. Maybe Pamuk meant to represent only the way the Venetian tradition was viewed by the Ottoman artists of the time? But it seemed to be a misrepresentation. First of all, the flow of influence between East and West was mutual, it wasn’t a one-way path from West to East. But more importantly, Venetian art — even the rediscovery (from ancient Roman and Greek art) of portraiture and female nudes — was replete with religious, mythological, literary and cultural iconography in the Western and Christian traditions, it was never just an attempt to paint exactly what the artist saw, as this novel represents. However, the points Pamuk made about realistic individual portraiture, a ""new"" and controversial thing -- were nevertheless fascinating and seemed valid — even the conflict that existed (in the Christian West as well) about whether this was or was not something God would smile upon.. Regarding the characters, I found the most interesting and complex to be the women: Shekure the beautiful, intelligent, somewhat spoiled and indecisive rich girl who had to find a path to her own power in a world where she is at the legal mercy of men; and Esther, the Jewish trader and message carrier who had a measure of freedom and autonomy but a difficult social position. And I wondered why Hayriye, the servant and concubine, was the only significant character who was never given her own time or her own voice.. This was my first Pamuk novel and I don’t know whether I’m interested in trying another. I might want to try his memoir of Istanbul.","Apr 30, 2017"
98545,Sarah,"Orhan Pamuk won the Nobel Prize for literature this year. Described as “part murder mystery, part love story,” I found this to be an absorbing novel, but what most interested me, and the reason that I recommend this book to you, were the passages which attempt to describe the late sixteenth-century Istanbul miniaturists’ attitudes towards art. My Name is Red, though it seems to be only loosely based upon historical fact, deals with the repercussions of the meeting of two visual worlds: Venetian portraiture and Islamic illustration.. Also, Pamuk writes some of the most fascinating lists I’ve read. I must admit that when I encounter lists in novels I usually skim them, but I found Pamuk’s lists engrossing throughout. I have typed out a few passages that I found especially significant, but they work better in context, of course.. Describing a painting of a horse.. “It is a handsome horse: a horse of the Ottoman line. It is a symbol that would demonstrate to the Venetian Doge Our Sultan’s wealth and the regions under his control. But on the other hand, as with everything the Venetian masters depict, this horse was also to be more lifelike than a horse born of God’s vision, more like a horse that lived in a particular stable with a particular groom in Istanbul so that the Venetian Doge might say to himself, ‘Just as the Ottoman miniaturists have come to see the world like us, so have the Ottomans themselves come to resemble us,’ in turn, accepting Our Sultan’s power and friendship. For if you draw a horse differently, you begin to see the world differently [emphasis added]. Despite its peculiarities, this horse was rendered in the manner of the old masters” (266).. Note the clever implications regarding Pamuk’s own novel.. Did a painting become legendary for what it was or for what was said about it? (266).. The musings of one of the Istanbul miniaturists.. My paintings reveal what the mind, not the eye, sees. But painting, as you know quite well, is a feast for the eyes. If you combine these two thoughts, my world will emerge. That is:. ALIF: Painting brings to life what the mind sees, as a feast for the eyes.. LAM: What the eye sees in the world enters the painting to the degree that it serves the mind.. MIM: Consequently, beauty is the eye discovering in our world what the mind already knows (281).","May 25, 2007"
7022024,Mike,"So yeah, I expected to like this book a lot. I mean, I. typically enjoy books from this setting. . For whatever reason I find the Byzantine and Ottoman Empires fascinating. Maybe because they sit between East and West and end up with a fascinating mix of different cultures and ideas, maybe because they are both so long lasting, or maybe it is because they, like Rodney Dangerfield, don't get no respect. But, as you can tell by the rating, it miserably failed to live up to my expectations.. Whatever the reason this book's description, murder of a miniaturist (artist) that was working on a controversial book for the Sultan, spoke to that part of my book sensibility. I mean, Ottoman Empire + Murder Mystery = Awesome book right? Right?!? RIGHT!?!?!?!. Well, in theory yes, but not in execution, for a multitude of reasons.. The biggest was that I just didn't care about the characters one bit. I didn't find any of them interesting or particularly engaging. Their troubles seemed particularly petty and uninteresting to me. The murder investigation (if it can even be called that) was mostly in the background and didn't really rev up until the end of the book. Too much was dedicated to the dull ""love"" story between Black and Shekure that bored me to no end (it didn't help there was a large age gap and the fact that they were first cousins). The first person and introspective nature of their POV characters just made them even more insufferable. Finally, the frequent change in POV was detrimental to any sort of narrative inertia.. Which isn't to say there were not any interesting characters, it just so happened that the only chapters that were engaging were from the POV of the recently deceased or items a storyteller was speaking through (a counterfeit coin, a dog, a horse). They explored more subtle aspects of Ottoman society and culture with a rather irreverent tone that pleased me. Or maybe they just weren't the boring humans the endeared themselves to me, honestly that bar was pretty low for me by the end.. And this is a shame because the book touches on what I think is a fascinating discussion about art, style, artist workshops, cultural and religious relationships within art and the wider society. All told the examination of how ""Frankish"" art, one that has perspective and tried to perfectly mimic what the artist sees, was going to impact the Ottoman style, which was based on older masters and the philosophy that a painting should represent what Allah saw. The idea that the old ways, which had been preserved for centuries, might be displaced by a new style, a style antithetical to the old way and from infidels, is a rich concept to explore. But the same themes about this topic were repeated too frequently and killed any interesting expansion of these ideas.. This book could have been great. It could have dug deeper into Ottoman society (of which we barely scratched the surface). It could have more clearly plumbed the depths of the artistic style dynamics that drove the action of the story without beating it into the ground. It could have had interesting characters that were dynamic and not bogged down in petty, uninteresting love plot lines. It could have been so much more but it wasn't and that may be the biggest tragedy of the entire thing. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.","Jun 30, 2016"
31294609,Ivan,My favourite book by Orhan Pamuk so far and one of the best pieces of historical fiction I read.,"Oct 27, 2014"
657496,Jeremy Allan,"At first look, Orhan Pamuk’s. My Name is Red. bears many resemblances to Umberto Eco’s. The Name of the Rose. : both take place in a period when manuscript illumination was a prestigious art, both deal in worlds where the licitness of books commanded great spiritual (and thus physical) importance, and both tell the story of a series of murders born out of the struggle for control of these things. Deeper consideration, though, shows that these two novels differ by more than the fact that the former in set in 16th century Istanbul, and the latter in 14th century Italy. Whereas Eco’s book centers on a group of clerics wrestling amongst each other (albeit in ways that represent much broader power struggles) over issues of faith,. My Name is Red. centers on secular artists, and though religion forms a thick blue vein through the story, Pamuk’s book is, before anything else, about art. In fact, to be even more precise, it is about perspective.. First, we have the historical context of the events of the story, where the Ottoman Empire was in frequent contact and competition with various European powers, notably Venice. This fraught contact led to the tentative exchange of ideas, in artistic techniques, for example. Thus, we come upon a major conflict in the background of this story: the arrival of European perspectival techniques in painting. Perspective in the visual arts brought with it a deep problematic in a Muslim society at that time, as the Koran sets clear limits on the righteousness of visual representation.. So, in this sense, we have another approach to perspective, that of competing interpretations of what constitutes righteousness and the righteous life. For Ottomans in the period in question, the official interpretation of the Koran and its religious authority were seated firmly with the Sultan. Pamuk’s story also introduces other perspectives, though, like that of Husret Hoja, a radical cleric who preaches an ascetic interpretation of the Koran, forbidding dancing, music, the drinking of coffee, and other “sinful” indulgences. His fanatic and violent followers reverberate with current fears of fundamentalist extremism of all stripes. Alongside the official, one might say moderate, interpretation and the extremist one, we have the many middling positions inhabited by the vast majority of the characters in the story: those who oscillate between secular and religious poles for reasons of fear, faith, and fastidiousness, among others.. Perhaps the most clear sense in which this story is about perspective, though, is in how it is told: while the novel is written in the first person, each of the fifty-nine chapters is narrated by a different character, and while the main characters reprise their roles as narrator many times, we still have twenty (by my count) different perspectives on what transpires in the story. And the point of view shifts radically, ranging from the perspective of a master illuminator, to a dog, to a corpse speaking from beyond the grave. None of these narrators are to be considered wholly reliable, each one addressing the reader more or less directly, often with the aim of persuading us. Much of that persuasion is related to guilt or innocence, as this is a story centered on murder, but that theme doesn’t exhaust the ways in which the various characters try to win us to their standpoint. They argue for art, religion, common decency, and many other reasons. Part of what makes this book masterful is that each voice is distinct and (mostly) consistent. The few moments where it becomes difficult to distinguish the voices of certain characters are, you discover later, purposeful and functional.. Let it be said: this is a superb book. It combines art, religion, and murder through a cunning weave of voices. No character is faultless, though many are deeply sympathetic, even in their faults. Where perhaps, at times, the story gets a little long-winded, especially in the exhaustive catalogues of paintings that characters marvel over, the expansive quality of the text makes for a good effect when Pamuk gets to the dirty business of violence and action; in a sense, the action is earned. For anyone interested in the period and culture of the middle Ottoman Empire, the text is fascinating and, without question, learned without being too overbearing in its smartness. Even in his great learning, Pamuk knows how to tell a story (to the point that it even becomes a joke in the text itself), even a murder mystery. I, for one, was never sure of the identity of the murderer before it was revealed, and this works well as a mechanism to keep the reader firmly invested in the narrative.. Whodunnit?!. Pamuk dunnit and dunnit well.. That last sentence was hard to write, both because of the annoying spelling, but also because I struggle to grant respect to Pamuk the man. I’ve had an aversion to him since I read his Nobel Prize acceptance speech; I reacted strongly against his ideas of what art is, who gets to make it, and what place he inhabits in that scheme. I also hated how he wrote about his father. But, I have had to soften my distaste and separate the man from the work. While I might still disagree with his personal views on art and writing, I cannot dispute his mastery, and this at least makes it a bit easier to grant him pardon on those personal views: he is so good that it is not a surprise that he feels as he does about the act of creation. And though I am beginning to think he cannot write a woman character (chapter fifty-four, “I Am a Woman,” may be the most revealing testament to that, intentional or not), Pamuk has shown me that despite controversy, the Nobel committee often selects very, very well. My growing love of Mario Vargas Llosa also adds to this sentiment of mine, but we’ll see how it progresses.. In any case, I recommend this book to anyone who has liked. The Name of the Rose. , even if I’ve already gone to lengths to show how the two books differ. Anyone interested should also not be scared off by the 666 pages: call him a devil, but if you commit yourself to the first four chapters, you’ll find yourself devoted to the rest of Pamuk’s tale. Besides, the pages turn easily; I found myself effortlessly reading one hundred pages in a sitting. If you’re still not certain, and if you haven’t already, try some of his other books first:. Snow. and. Istanbul. are both recommended. He still pisses me off, this Orhan Pamuk, but perhaps that is partly motivated by raw envy. In considering that, I realize that with. My Name is Red. , he has certainly taught me something, and that is his gift to give.","Aug 13, 2013"
5204784,Vonia,"This started out amazing. The first chapter is narrated by a dead man, Elegant Enfendi. Each chapter after that is narrated by someone indicated in a subtitle, including the protagonist (arguable) Black; his love interest since childhood/also his cousin Shekure; the other main miniaturists, nicknamed Butterfly, Olive, and Stork; the murderer (the main suspects are the other three miniaturists); Black's uncle/Shekure's father/the head miniaturist who was overseeing a secretive book requested by his grace the Sultan that led to this murder, Enishte Enfendi; Esther, the clothier, local gossip, and matchmaker on the side, one of me favorite personalities (""Does love make one a fool, or do only fools fall in love?""); a coin, a tree, the color red (""colors are not known, but felt""; try to explain a color to someone who has always been blind.. Does this all seem confusing? Well, it was. Definitely found myself needing to reread; reading a lot of beautiful words and passages, but then having to question what exactly it was that I read.. As the novel went on it became more and more philosophical, becoming more confusing as it went. Most of it was interesting, though drawn out. By the last hundred pages, I really lost interest and moved on to another book before coming back to finish reading this. Even then, it was a little bit of work.. One of the things I always love about Orhan Pamuk is how he ""cameos"" in most of his novels. Here, he is the younger son to Shekure, the one who likes Black, while his older brother has a loyalty to Shekure's first husband and their father, missing for years now.. Obviously there is a lot of history here; the Ottoman time period, accurately portrayed, even very well portrayed from what I understand. Time and setting are there own characters here. Most of it went over my head, as I am the first to admit that history is not my forté. A chronology from around 330 B.C. until 1617 is even included as an appendix.. I did like the ambiance of the novel, the feeling and transporting experience that Pamuk is always able to masterfully create. A world with Sultans and swords, gilded illustrations and beautiful books, secret bills and illuminated manuscripts, jinns and ghosts, gold coins and palaces, dark alleys and open air markets, murder and intrigue, love and war. There is constant mention of the ancient story of Hüsrev and Shirin, in particular a scene where she falls in love with him after seeing his picture, a frame having from a tree in the countryside.. I found interesting the method used by Master Osman to determine the murderer. In a painting of a horse they know to be by the hand of the murderer, they notice an irregularity on its nose. To locate this same irregularity again would be to locate the murderer. At least according to the ""courtesan method"", which would uncover the hidden signature of the artist, borne by a horse which has been drawn from memory through the quick and skillful movement of the hand. The theory goes that artists draw from memory (even when copying another painting, the artist is looking at his own painting and hand as he paints, so for those few seconds from looking from the other painting to his own, is still painting from memory), and therefore in something so subtle could not be prevented. ""Even mediocre artists must know a genuine illustration isn't drawn according to what the eye sees at any particular moment, but according to what the hand remembers and is accustomed to. The painter is always alone before the page. Solely for this reason he is always dependent on memory."". Incorporated with the above is the belief first expressed by the great miniaturist Bihzad that the greatest illustrators would be granted blindness by Allah in their later years. Many of the miniaturist of the old style still look upon blindness as a great virtue of Allah's Grace, and may even sit for weeks in the darkness in the dim light in order to learn how to receive the world like a blind man, despite not truly being blind. Bizhad blinded himself in order to avoid being forced to paint like the Venetians. Master Osman does the same. Black blinds Olive, the murderer, before he escapes (then is subsequently murdered). This is an interesting concept to me, as I do see a great amount of validity in the idea that the best artist should be able to draw and paint blindly.. The main art philosophy discussed is how the miniaturists (illustrators are called miniaturists here) should be painting. Namely, the Ottoman way is to follow tradition, to not try to stand out. Painting without its story is impossible. ""Style"" is imperfection. A perfect one needs no signature. ""Signature"" and ""Style"" are but means of brazenly The feared, ""sinful"" way is that of the French. The secret book (one painting especially) Enishte was is charge of, by request from The Sultan, was such a sin and was the cause of the murder and all the subsequent drama because 1) things were not depicted according to their importance in Allah's mind, but realistically, as they appeared to the naked eye; 2) The Sultan, The Caliph of Islam, was the same size as a pet; 3) Satan was also the same size, furthermore, in an endearing light; worst of all, 4) The Sultan, like the Christians and their idolatrous tendencies with their portraits, was as large as life and his face had full details!. Conclusion: Should have been a lot shorter. Has some great insights into Art Philosophy. Another great portrayal of the Turkish/Ottoman time period. Liked the metafiction/fourth wall aspects and Pamuk's cameo. Would have loved this if it were condensed.. ""Painting meant seeing this world yet depicting it as if it were the Otherworld."". "" What we essentially want is to draw something unknown to us in all its shadowiness, not something known to us in all its illumination."" (I disagree. I want something unknown to us in all its illumination. But something to think about.). **** Spoilers ****. I guessed who the murderer was early on. One of the main clues for me was on Page 238.. Elegant Effendi believed that portraiture was the greatest of sins and it was because Olive was afraid he would reveal what they had all done (albeit unknowingly) for this secret book, shaming them all, that he died.. Aside from the art discussions, there is the story of protagonist Black. He had been in love with his cousin Shekure since they were young children. In fact, he left Turkey as a young teenager after being turned down by her on order to forget her. It is now right years later and he has returned from his world travels. Shekure had since married, but her husband went off to war and had yet to return. He did that his love for her had never died, and she has some for him (keyword ""some"". I never get the sender she truly loves him with any passion). In order to marry Black, she has to file for divorce by finding neighbors to pledge to her husband's death. I believe she is doing this for selfish reasons; because her husband's brother Hasan is determined to ""keep"" Shekure, almost as a slave. According to him, under the eyes of Allah, she belongs to him, the brother of a very much alive man who he has claimed for years will return very soon.. After the showdown amongst the illustrators, the murderer Olive stabs Black in the shoulder before his escape into the night; his plan is to board a ship the following morning. Hasan, mistaking him for one of Black's men who had abducted Shekure from his place in the middle of the night, murdered him before this could transpire. Black's wounds are not fatal, but does cause his shoulders to be uneven for the remainder of his life. As told by ""I, Shekure"" in the final chapter, he is depressed from then on; not, as most suspect, because of his neck that never completely heals. Shekure is not entirely sure why her husband black is depressed for the rest of his life, but I suspect it has to do with his loss of pride. It certainly does not help that her ex husband's brother Hasan was the one who killed Olive, the one deed Shekure had asked of him, to avenge her father's murderer. Shekure, in my opinion, never truly loves Black; is admittedly a little in love with Hasan.. The secret book with the sinful paintings, the book that started all these murders, was never finished.","Feb 17, 2017"
1805692,Amalia,"I've spent quite a bit of time debating how to rate this book- more than once it nearly landed on my ""May I please have these hours of my life back"" shelf, mostly because it moves so, so slowly and because (for me) the detail that Pamuk puts into it turns into nothing more than tedium.. However, parts of the story are so beautiful and well-written (see the chapters written from the perspective of the color red or the horse in the painting) that I don't feel that my time was entirely wasted.. Why this book was difficult for me:. -The book moves incredibly slowly; as best I was able to calculate, all 400+ pages of ""action"" occur in approximately one week.. -I found it absolutely impossible to connect with the characters at an emotional level. Esther, who is a bit player, was the one I found most interesting and would really enjoy learning more about.. -Did I mention that it's really, really slow-moving? Like molasses. In winter.. Why this book was wonderful:. -Pamuk's writing is lyrical, as it always is.. -The cultural tension of being Turkish and the implications of the Eastern and Western influences; this was something that going to Turkey gave me a much greater appreciation for..

3687216,Yelda Basar Moers,"""Painting is the silence of thought and the music of sight."". I adore this book, a love story and philosophical thriller immersed in the life of miniature painting in the Ottoman court. I found myself spellbound by its prose the first time I read it! And now even more so with the second read. Nobel-prize-winning Turkish author Orhan Pamuk has a style reminiscent of Borges, Proust and Nabokov. A soulful, dreamy quality emanates from his sentences and chapters, which read like an epic poem as much as they illuminate with vibrant storytelling. There are so many poignant and poetic phrases, such as ""I don't want to be a tree, I want to be its meaning,"" ""to paint is to remember,"" and ""time doesn't flow if you don't dream."". My Name is Red is set in the 16th century Ottoman Empire and chronicles the lives of a workshop of miniaturists who have been commissioned by the reigning Sultan to complete a book of paintings. Two of the members are murdered and the main narrative follows the trail of discovering the culprit. It is a philosophical thriller but also a love story. One of my favorite passages from the book is the following: ""Tell me then, does love make one a fool or do only fools fall in love?"". There are at times the most intricate details about miniature painting and multiple narratives that switch with each chapter (there are a total of twelve narrators, among them the main characters, but also Satan, Death, a Tree and a Dog). The book has its own original form, almost as a miniature painting in itself, and delves into the life of 16th century Islamic miniature art in a way that few books can do. Orhan Pamuk himself won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2008. His writing enchants and leaves me breathless every time! He's written a number of novels, essays and a beautiful memoir about Istanbul, the city my father was born and raised in. I've read several of his books and I look forward to reading the rest of his oeuvre!. Some critics say the novel is dead, but My Name is Red is an example of how the novel is very much alive.

5459072,Neal Adolph,"Let me be careful here, talking about this big and beautiful book. The three stars doesn't reflect the heights that it brought me to, the excitement it filled me with, the thrill of beautiful language and beautiful imagery, of endearing characters and of interesting ideas. No, the three stars doesn't capture that, and so I think you would be mostly wise to ignore the stars entirely; maybe you can even forgive me for having used stars. I like them. They are pretty.. But I can't give the book more than three stars in good conscience, and so I have settled on that worst of all the numbers - the one that spreads from the truly disappointing. The Human Stain. to the passable and pleasant. The Glassy Sea. to the endearing and enduring. Segu. - in the hopes that you will overlook the writing and give this book a chance one day. It contains a lot of gems.. The most prominent of those gems is, I would say, the writing, which at times is over-indulgent, but is almost always beautiful. When it gets going, when its pacing is just right, it reaches the heights of Garcia Marquez and Rushdie, the high romanticism of euphoria. When it isn't quite right it fumbles in search of some good editing.. The next most prominent is the theme, or the layers of themes, which fill this book. It plays with art, predominantly, and how that art should be informed by society or shouldn't be, and what kind of relationship we can have with art. It ranges from the obsessive, to the conservative, to those desiring mass changes to the standard to those hoping to protect. It tosses in colonialism, and the political battles between East and West at the end of the 16th Century. It discusses power, of course, as all things do. It really does all of these things wonderfully, beautifully, wrapping it all in the often miraculous words and sentences and images that I referenced above.. The next most prominent, for me, is the depth of the world that we are shown in this book. This is a strength, though I found it difficult for me to interact with it at times given my extreme ignorance of the region, the religion, the history and context. But it is lovely, and rich, in its representation here. I was often totally impressed by the meta-fictional references to literature from 450 years ago. I was often totally impressed by the body of parables that Pamuk brings to the table. This is clearly a world very different than anything I have ever experienced, and it is, in many ways, a beautiful place to let your mind explore for a bit.. The next most prominent are the voices. There are a lot of them in this book with each chapter having a different narrator than the one which preceded it. At times those voices are from inanimate objects which have some grand story about how they have come to exist, and that, in their way, add some kind of commentary onto the book. I love thinking of being told a story by a coin, a tree drawn on paper, a skull, the colour Red, but I also came to admire the intelligence of Black, of Osman, of Shekure, and, most of all, of Esther. The characters here are endearing, memorable, pleasant to witness and read the world with.. So the voices are great, and they make great characters. Except for those characters which are, perhaps, most important to the central murder plot. Butterfly, Stork, Olive, and Elegant are all difficult to differentiate from each other. I guess that is important as plot device, but it makes the plot seem like it is fluffy - a poorly disguised vehicle to explore some of the ideas which the author found more intriguing. And here is the cause of the three stars (everything I have said thus far would suggest that the book is worthy at least of 4, no?). The plot is difficult to make sense of as it develops and, when it does take on some kind of concrete form for the reader, it ultimately feels like it is borderline absurd or silly, and really not of any great consequence. It has its strong moments, of course, but it also had its weak moments - and unfortunately, it ends on a moment of weakness rather than power.. But I don't think anybody is really going to come away from this book feeling like they read it for the story or plotline - at least, I hope not. It contains something far more important to offer us, stories and ideas far more intriguing than the story we are witnessing. I would like to come back to it after learning more about Turkey and the Ottoman Empire, maybe after reading more by Pamuk. I suspect there are a great many secrets I have missed entirely. Illuminated scripts sound enchanting and this book may be as well.","Nov 15, 2016"

Hate: went on for way too long and after about 40% of the 20+ hours (count them!!!!) it devolved into a boring story of which miniaturist drew what in order to figure out who the murderer was, how they either went blind or put their eyes out because blindness was a source of pride, etc. etc. I was ready to poke my own eyes out!. But I persevered and listened to the entire thing. John Lee did an admirable job in voicing all the characters and I'm glad I read this even though I didn't like it as much overall as I did in the first part. It could have been exhilarating if the second 60% had been condensed.","Dec 17, 2016"

This was a mystery in a beautiful setting and beautiful language. I could not read this book too fast. Many paragraphs and chapters I had to re-read to make sure I was getting the full meaning. That's not too say this book was dense or hard to read. It is just that it is a book to be savored.. The mystery plot was well thought out and the use of multiple points of view - while frustrating at times - made for an excellent plot.","Dec 09, 2016"
7392004,Quo,"My Name is Red. is a novel on a grand scale, set in 16th century Istanbul, a tale that is complex, wondrous & at times humorous but which also represents an occasionally frustrating blend of Turkish history, autobiographical detail & ultimately a murder mystery that sweeps the reader into the late medieval Muslim world of miniaturist art & the lives of those devoted to creating it. Orhan Pamuk's masterful work of fiction can be compared to Herman Hesse'. Magister Ludi. (The Bead Game) and Umberto Eco's. The Name of the Rose. .. The first person narrative includes the primary miniature artists, including Olive, Stork, Butterfly & Black but also extended to their mentor & head illustrator, Osman, Black's beloved, Shekure, a tree, a horse, a dog, a corpse, Satan & two dervishes. The elaborate cast of characters stating their case even includes the color red, becoming akin to an active character in the novel. In an attempt to describe how these many divergent voices interact with each other, I would suggest that. My Name is Red. functions as a kind of morality play pitting opposed forces against one another--good vs. evil; east vs. west, with Istanbul as crossroads; traditional Muslim miniaturist art vs. the encroaching force of Venetian or ""Frankish"" (western) art that is more representational & more personal; and even Persian military strength & Chinese influence arriving via the Silk Road, viewed as a threat to Islamic art, to the Koran & to the Turkish interpretation of history.. However, of the many infidel or non-Islamic incursions, the greatest peril occurs when the sultan sends envoys to Italy to view Venetian paintings that are far different from traditional miniaturist art in terms of style, use of color, the manner in which the characters are personalized & even the employment of the artist's signature on the painting, all of which are seen by some as a distinct threat to Islamic values. For, traditional miniaturist art is representational only in a vague manner, most certainly never portraying specific or recognizable faces rather than generic figures. It is declared by a renowned Islamic historian from Herat in present-day Afghanistan that ""the greatest sin of the devil is to say. I. "". Alas, there are a great many ""infidel influences"", coffee among them. Here is just one view of the way in which the work of a miniaturist is viewed:. We mistakenly assumed that these stories arose out of words & that illustrations were painted in service to these stories. Quite to the contrary, painting is the act of seeking out Allah's memories & viewing the world as he sees it. A miniaturist united with the vision & landscape of Allah's immortal time can never return to the manuscript pages meant for ordinary mortals.. My Name is Red. is exceedingly dense at times, introducing Turkish history & rarefied words dealing with miniature art that have a particular meaning only in the context of the story, while at the same time conveying a rich tapestry of detail that with each page causes the reader to become increasingly invested in this amazing jigsaw puzzle of novel. One of the considerable allegorical tools used by Orhan Pamuk in. My Name is Red. is countering the illumination of visual detail via illustration with blindness. The author does this very adeptly throughout his novel. Miniaturists are so devoted to their craft that eventual blindness is seen as a gift.. They accepted the work, the endless drawing & staring at pages by candlelight for days without break, as the pleasurable labor that delivered the miniaturist to blindness, with some seeking out the most appropriate moment for this most glorious of approaching eventualities, either by purposely hurrying blindness through the painstaking depictions of trees & all their leaves on fingernails, grains of rice & even on strands of hair, or by cautiously delaying the imminent darkness by the effortless drawing of pleasant sun-filled gardens. Some of the miniaturists of the old style look upon blindness as the greatest virtue of Allah's grace & they are embarrassed by growing old but not blind.. Later in the novel, a miniaturist intentionally blinds himself in order to ""preserve his vision"" of art within his consciousness, while not being called upon to adjust to a changing style, while another artist is blinded by a rival. The questions arises as to whether the measure of a miniaturist's talent is to depict everything with perfection or to introduce into the picture that which no one else can see. Always, art is driven by an intense life-force which can either ""force the most devout man to renounce his faith or bring the most hopeless, unrepentant unbeliever to Allah's path"". For, if an artist draws a horse differently, he begins to see the world differently, with the ensuing personal style seen as leading to damnation.. What attracts us to writing, illustrating & painting in bound up in a fear of retribution. We also want those we have forsaken to see & appreciate the inspired pictures we've made, even if they should call us sinners. Genuine painting is hidden in the agony no one sees & which others will call bad, heretical or blasphemous. Oh the suffering this brings upon the painter of genuine talent, a frightful, nerve-wracking experience! The birth of a new style vs. imitation of an old one results in years of disagreements, jealousies & rivalries.. There is murder embedded within. My Name is Red. but to even hint at the complexity to this aspect of the novel might come close to revealing the mystery that is at the heart of Orhan Pamuk's master work. What constituted for me much of the beauty of this expansive novel was the author's attempt to have the reader see the world through the eyes of the characters in a miniature painting, to drop back in time as it were & to visualize Istanbul in the 16th century, with each element of this mosaic of characters having a distinct voice, even if the reader is a. Frank. (non-Islamic) spectator ""committing the error of looking at the world with his naked eye & rendering what he saw."". As with the title of the Pamuk novel, red is more than just a color in the miniaturists' palate but has a metaphorical & symbolic role to play, merging bloodshed with a dominant, forceful color, as when a character intones, ""we imagined how we watched with pleasure the slow spread of a deadly red seeping from a bronze inkpot that had cracked over a page 3 illuminators have labored on for 3 months."" Likewise, there are frequent references to the early 11th century Persian epic, the. Shahnameh. (""Book of Kings"") by Ferdowsi & to the tale of Husrev & Shirin, a 12th century Persian work by Nizami. There are elements in. My Name is Red. that bear witness to these classic stories & others that are drawn from the author's own life.. I have chosen to focus on the craft of painting & illustration in my review because it was through a long consideration of the process of painting that Orhan Pamuk was able to distill his knowledge of miniatures into the tale that eventually became the novel. However, in this way, I can also avoid dealing with spoiler alerts & leave the solution to the novel's great mystery component to future readers.. My Name is Red. represents a fusion of words & colors, of narrative tale & miniature art + the fairy tale-like material derived from classical Islamic literature, all in all, a magical blend.. *The author's very personal introduction in my Everyman's Library/Alfred A. Knopf version of the novel is extensive & stands as an overview of the gestation process for. My Name is Red. , 6 years in the process of writing but reflective of the author's lifetime of interest in painting in general & specifically the world of miniature art. The translation from the Turkish was by Erdag Goknar. **The map & historical chronology were also quite helpful.","Sep 16, 2019"
1207684,Bruce,"This novel by Orhan Pamuk, Nobel Prize in Literature-winning Turkish author, is creatively written and raises intriguing questions about the process of artistic production.. Using the chronology at the end of the book, I conclude that the book’s events are taking place at the end of the 16th century. The multiple perspectives - each short chapter reflects a different one - seem to be different characters. The setting is Istanbul. A murder has occurred. Who is the murderer? “Olive” or “Stork” or “Butterfly”? Woven throughout this fascinating philosophic and artistic treatise is an engaging mystery story. Another murder occurs; we know the murderer but not his name. Black and Sekure finally get married, an apparent resolution of sorts but too early in the book, just halfway through, to be convincing as the reliever of tension. And indeed, complications immediately begin to arise. Now the artistic argument is turned on its head, and Horse asserts that the painting of Generic Horse, or the Form of Horse, is idolatrous and that the painting of the particular as it simply is seen is preferable. The plot becomes more dangerous, the outcome unclear until the novel’s very end.. The main characters are artistic miniaturists, illustrators of manuscripts. Tiny hints in each chapter, often just a word or a phrase, provide linkages between chapters and clarify relationships between characters. These make the narrative comprehensible. A key issue or question involves the process of artistic creation, whether the perfection of creativity is originality or rather whether true virtuosity consists of absolute subjugation of the artist to tradition, without any evidence in the work of his own “style” or signature characteristics, ie keeping himself absolutely anonymous. There is initial discussion of the Islamic injunction against specific artistic representation of objective reality vs Venetian portraiture, representation of a specific individual person, thus identifiable. This issue is at the root of the issues to be explored in this novel. The desire for originality by an artist seems to imply the desire for personal renown, and that is to imply a fall from perfection, perfection in a work of art implying purity, without any reference to the artist. The perfect artist would create the same work of art again and again, precisely the same each time, doing nothing to draw attention to himself as creator. Representational painting elevates the importance of the object represented and runs the risk that the representation itself will come to be worshipped, a form of idolatry. By extension, all art - consider, for example, literature - becomes the product of a human creator imitating or even co-opting the office of the Divine. Art, like language, becomes not only an abstraction from and of reality, and thus “art-ificial” but also a temptation, the seduction being that it might be valued not only in and of itself but also above Reality. This argument of course has validity only if one posits a Creator outside Creation; if one denies that, then any creation has equal validity and value.. Again and again the narrative explores the nature of art, the differences in both technique and philosophy between Islamic and European painting. I am fascinated by the insights into Islamic illumination of manuscripts and miniature painting. Social customs are interesting, too. A recurrent theme is the waning of the artistic paradigm of the Ottoman region and era, that of ornamentation, in favor of the European (Venetian and Frankish) paradigm of representation, the former eventually succumbing to the latter. Neither really reflects reality but rather a frozen and static moment that presents emotion only with difficulty.. The conservative nature of established religion, considering anything innovative heretical, is certainly still with us. “Two styles heretofore never brought together…come together to create something new and wondrous…May (Allah) protect us from the will of the pure and unadulterated.” That is the liberal challenge. “A great painter does not content himself by affecting us with his masterpieces; ultimately, he succeeds in changing the landscape of our minds.” This is the promise, and this is the threat. Is there something about Islam that is fundamentally conservative vis-à-vis Christianity and Western Civilization? While that point is debatable, it is also probably too baldly stated. Both clearly have conservative and liberal elements, but one gains the impression in this book that Pamuk is asserting that the emphasis of the former is more conservative. I found this work fascinating and challenging, raising important issues and questions. Pamuk writes very well, and his style is engaging. There are hints throughout the book pointing to the often critical reception that his writing has received in his home country.","Apr 17, 2011"
41578933,Pechi,"Much like its heartland Istanbul known for its unique confluence of the cultures of East and West, My Name is Red is a fascinating junction of genres - thriller, mystery, literary & historical fiction, ekphrasis, and by a stretch, romance. The story is told in a refreshingly unique form - each chapter in the perspective of a character or an object or even a color. This slideshow of perpetually shifting perspectives is an enormous risk because it could all go awry way too easily and with a high probability, frustrate the readers into abandoning the book (The Spinning Heart comes to my mind). But Orhan Pamuk seamlessly breezes through this obstacle and the storytelling remains novel as ever for the complete length of the book.. Illustrations, illuminations, paintings, lives of the artists creating these works of art, their thoughts and struggles, the religious and political meteorology of their times, forces and desires influencing and giving shape to their lives - My Name is Red wafts through these subjects with a subtle ease and uncommon depth, and succeeds in leaving a lasting impression of the zeitgeist of the 16th century Turkey.. I've never given much thought to the evolution of paintings over centuries or the lives of artists living in extremely repressive religious circumstances and it was very interesting to delve into these spheres. Creation of art being chained to religious beliefs and moral policing with pious zealots acting as the ultimate arbiters of art (Satanic Verses much?) could either suppress all imagination or give rise to interesting and clever new works. Here, it plays a very important psychological role in guiding the miniaturists and their complex emotions, causing them to be entangled in a constant tug of war between faith and art. Any innovation and individual style is considered sacrilegious and the response of different artists to this attitude is interesting to observe. I would never have imagined that painting a face as it is would have been such a taboo 500 years ago!. While the abundance of fascinating detail holds us in rapture for the first half of the book, it backfires midway and injects a steady stream of tedium into our reading experience. I was most enraged by the chapter where Master Osman goes through hundreds of books in a library in search of the illustration of a horse. Similar sounding illustrations from most of these books are described in painstaking detail for pages and pages and unbearable more pages. It is obvious that a great amount of research went into the making of this book but cramming all the details into the narrative is plain unacceptable.. A brilliant book that could've been much better had it not been consumed by its own magnificence and dragged down by its very weight.. Btw, here are some random facts that surprised me:. *The existence of book arts! Does this still happen in our century?. *Taboo associated with painting in those times and the contempt for 'Frankish' portraits. We take so much for granted these days!. *Presence of slaves in Turkey. While black slavery is much written about, we don't frequently encounter many of these slaves belonging to other countries in famous literature. Are there any books about these forgotten people? Am I just being super ignorant here?. *The plight of intelligent women in the olden times.. *The very obvious current of homosexuality in such religious circumstances. *Chinese influence on Turkey","Jun 20, 2016"
2876105,Marc,"Pamuk has done his best to bring the reader into confusion. This book is composed of 59 relatively short monologues by different characters related to one another, but also from non-human characters (a coin, a tree, a dog and the book even opens with a corpse talking, yes!). Think Faulkner, but driven one step further. It takes a while before you can distinguish the storylines.. The place of action is Istanbul, late 16th century, the Ottoman empire at its height. The main storyline is the discussion and (deadly) fight between miniaturists at the court of the sultan about wether the eastern or western style should be followed when airing manuscripts. The oriental style stands for the idealistic representation of the classic stories (from a divine perspective; and mastery expresses itself in perfect imitation), the occidental stands for naturalism with recognizable faces (the individuals perspective; mastery lies in a very own special style). It's a discussion on the cutting edge, because murders happen, what makes the book seem a bit like ""the name of the Rose"" by Umberto Eco (with its references to Borges). The second storyline revolves around the graceful Sjekure which is coveted by several men after her husband has been missing for four years.. The short pieces, each with varying perspective give the book momentum and you regularly make new discoveries; and the many oriental tales give the work an entertaining, exotic flavor. And, of course, the fundamental debate (realism versus idealism in art) is extremely fascinating. But while reading I more and more got the impression that Pamuk was talking about something else than just a debate amongst artistic schools. The opposition Muslim-Western art is far too simplistic, because in Islamic art too there were more realistic movements, while idealism regularly resurfaces in western art. Pamuk seems to join the Orientalism representation ( ""East is East and West is West, and never the twain Shall Meet""), which is a completely outdated vision. Maybe he just wanted to expose fundamentalism (in this book represented by the godfearing illuminators), but then he did not do a convincing job. Moreover, the storyline around Sjekure really disappointed me: her character is very one-dimensional (like the other female figure Esther), so much so that I have serious questions about the female image of Pamuk.. All in all, an entertaining and sometimes fascinating read, but I had expected more. (2.5 stars)","May 24, 2016"
46365949,Ishaque A.,"Profoundly exuberant, this book is a piece of art in itself. It is deeply rich in history and culture and gives deep insight into the art of painting during the Ottoman reign in the 16th century Istanbul.. There are extremely minute and comprehensive details about the designs, colors, brushes, drawing styles as well as the jealousy and love among the painters, gilders, miniaturists and masters in the painting workshops that one feels like being a part of that era while reading this book. The author has taken the reader throughout the book in a unique style where each and every character and the objects, pictures and even colors communicate directly in first person to the reader and fascinate with their story and explain the context in their own point of view. There are in-depth details and stories within stories which will take the reader to a further deeper level in this colorfully rich tapestry and in parallel to this, there is a love story, and a murder mystery which is to be solved by the reader himself as every object and character gives a clue to complete the missing piece of the puzzle.. It was fascinating to read about an empire which was once the most powerful and was slowly coming to its decline. The unwritten dogma of blindness among master miniaturists was unknown to me until I have read this book and is really strange to know that natural blindness among them was perceived as an honour or even a gift of God, some miniaturists went too far to protect their style that they purposely either blinded themselves or pretended to be blind for the rest of their lives. I didn’t know that homosexuality was common among Muslims of that time, if in any case, it is true, especially using young boys for carnal desires is very disturbing.. I am amazed by the deep knowledge of art and history Orhan Pamuk possesses and is capable of not just imagining the story of that period but also to represent the intricate details in such a beautiful way that it felt like observing all of it as a master miniaturist examining an extraordinary work of art with his magnifying lens.. The art of painting is already lost and is not something which is found among Muslims nowadays, this quote from the book concludes sadly what we have lost:. “Just as the doors of houses are closed of an evening and the city is left to darkness, painting was also abandoned. It was mercilessly forgotten that we’d once looked upon our world quite differently”","May 17, 2017"

1798222,Shane,"A treasure trove of a book that provides rich insights into art in the Ottoman Empire and the conflict caused by the influence of god-less European styles on its evolution, while teasing the reader along with a murder-mystery plot and a love story to hold interest.. The central plot involves the murders of miniaturist painters by one of their peers. Why? These miniaturists are painting human and animal images to illustrate a book commissioned by the Sultan, at a time when imagery is frowned on by the Ottomans and is considered to be usurping the power of God. Only the Frankish painters of Europe have perfected the art of perspective, imagery and portraiture, which every wealthy person, including the Sultan, sees as his path to immortality. The secondary plot involves the long-suffering love story of Black and Shekure; he a writer commissioned to write the Sultan’s book, she the wife of a soldier gone missing in battle and who thus is not free to re-marry or divorce.. The novel is narrated by a myriad of voices: the miniaturists, the victims, the paintings, Black, Shekure, secondary characters, and the murderer. And this is the book’s weakness, for after awhile many of these first-person narratives blend into a single voice. But the breadth of the multiple voices provide a panoramic sweep of 16th century life in Istanbul: its customs, history, politics, religious and social divisions, and the various tools and environments of the artist’s trade. One narrator, a coin, traces its path through the hands and orifices of the many who have handled it in the last little while, and you could end up being squeamish of dealing in cash and coin henceforth! We also get a tour through the art collection stored in the Royal Treasury and it comes replete with legends and stories associated with the subjects depicted—rich lore similar to another Thousand and One Nights epic. Even the miniaturists associate their philosophy of life with legend and they recount their pet stories in interesting detail. Not all of these side stories are relevant to the central plot, but I sensed that the Nobel-Prize aspiring author Pamuk (he won the award a few years after this book was published) was seeking to infuse his novel with grand themes that build a hefty oeuvre deemed worthy of the Nobel.. The painter’s philosophy is explained: Style and Signature is the drive for individuality and differentiation, and Blindness is the ultimate goal of the miniaturist whose eyes succumb after years of work on fine detail, like painting on grains of rice. Some seek blindness voluntarily in order to paint from memory which is supposed to be better than painting from observation. God is supposedly revealed through Blindness.. The style of writing is classical and dense, and, while creating the right atmosphere, can impede the stagecraft during action scenes; it also lends to repetition as we hover over the same issues while different narrators offer their individual perspectives on them. The characters of Black and Shekure are unusual as lovers and stilted in their performance; Black comes across as a martyr while Shekure is a scheming, insecure woman. Both are pretty amateur in the sex department, perhaps reflective of the sexual behaviour of their restricted social class at the time.. There is a lot in the book, and it all cannot be commented on in a short review of this nature, and even though there are many off-plot digressions, these detours are interesting, for they enhance our knowledge of the Ottoman Empire and of human thought at that time. One thing is certain: ego, vanity, envy, pride, poverty and dedication were the lot of the artist then as it is now. And I never guessed who the murderer was and therefore kept reading to the last page.. This book is to be approached with respect and with a curiosity to learn about history and art, while allowing oneself to be entertained by the writer’s pet ploys (or crutches): the murder-mystery puzzle and the love story.","Jun 08, 2017"
42294189,Roger Brunyate,"No Miniature This!. My Name Is Red. is a huge and densely-composed novel set in late-16th-century Istanbul among the small closed circle of miniature painters, who work their whole lives until (and even after) they go blind, illustrating books which may never been seen again by any other than their rich patrons. Though clearly a masterpiece, it is by no means an easy read.. I came to this after reading Pamuk's later novel,. Snow. .. What the two have in common is a concern with Islam and an examination of its place in a secularized world; they also share a large scale and a certain sense of fantasy. But whereas. Snow. is set in the modern world (albeit a distant outpost of it) and is told from a single perspective,. My Name Is Red. takes the reader back to 1591 and proceeds in a kaleidoscope of short chapters written by different characters in the story—including Satan, a corpse, a dog, a tree, and (as in the title) a pot of red ink! Even the covers of the two books show their differences:. Snow. almost monochromatic,. My Name Is Red. a collage of brilliantly colored panels and borders from miniatures such as those described in the book. The color, lightness, and even sense of fun draw the reader easily into the book until he is either held or repelled by the intensity of its philosophical argument.. There are two main plot strands: the mystery of a master miniaturist murdered by one of his colleagues, and a love story. The latter, actually, is not dissimilar to the situation in Snow: an exile returning after many years, hoping to be reunited with a former sweetheart who has since married another man. But, as in much medieval and renaissance literature, the point is less the story than the many digressions within the story: lists, legends, historical precedents, parables and counterparables, and above all disquisitions on the nature and purpose of figurative art within a culture whose religion forbids it. Pamuk's handling of these sections is virtuosic, and they become the verbal equivalent of the miniatures and decorations in an illuminated manuscript, and the main reason why one opens the book.. I would have to say that Pamuk does not seem to put much emphasis on the delineation of character, or perhaps that he is not always successful at it. The major figures in the love story come over quite clearly: the writer Black, his beloved Shekure, her children Shevket and Orhan, and (to a lesser extent) her father Enishte. But the miniaturists—nicknamed Olive, Butterfly, and Stork—one of whom must be the murderer, are distinguished more by subtle differences in their attitude to their art than by qualities of character. So the reader has little alternative but to go along with the author in solving the mystery more as a theorem in aesthetics and religion than as an outcome of human nature.. The book's color and brilliance of linguistic invention reminds me a little of Salman Rushdie, though Pamuk is a much cooler writer. But the closest parallel that comes to mind (although it is a long time since I read the book) is Umberto Eco's. The Name of the Rose. —another murder mystery used to frame historical, religious, and philosophical disquisitions in the old manner. Readers who enjoyed Eco should certainly try Pamuk.","Apr 30, 2016"
3131238,Judy,"My Name is Red. captures the essence of an era of Turkish book illustration during the 16th century. It is a crafty murder mystery centering around the murder of Elegant Effendi, a gold giltworker employed by the workshop of Master Osman and involved in moonlighting for his father-in-law on a Shah-commissioned book.. What I liked:. *Pamuk conceals the murder exceptionally well. Although, I had suspicions I never quite knew for sure who the murderer was until revealed. He strings the reader along expertly. Well done!. *The uniqueness of telling the story from several first-person viewpoints including the perspective of a tree, dog and coin kept me interested, if for nothing else, to see if I would get tired of it, until the end of the book.. *Pamuk's writing style contains a spunkiness that I enjoyed.. *The reader is immersed in the history, religion and culture of the Ottoman Empire, particularly in regards to illustration.. Okay, what's not to like? Well, a lot:. *Pamuk does. too. good of a job of immersing the reader in the history, religion and culture. The narrators gushing over aspects of ancient illustrations got very tedious!. *This book as billed as a love story in addition to the mystery. IMO, its only a love story by loose definition. I admired Shekure for being a clever woman, but the ""love story"" angle seems to get lost (for the most part) in the last one-third of the book. There is a token chapter devoted to Shekure at the end of the book, but it seems anti-climatic and disappointing after the murderer is revealed.There is a lengthy section of the book between Shekure's last two chapters allowing the reader to forget about her problems.. *I found the frequent references to buggering young apprentices nauseous. Particularly, since the book treated it like the young boys were being done a favor by being buggered by the much older miniaturists and Master Osman. Also, none of the buggering figured into the plot of the story in the least. It was totally extra ""color"". Perhaps, it was an accepted part of Ottoman culture, I don't know, but one reference would have been sufficient to express this.. As much as I admired the style, knowledge of the subject matter and portrayal of Ottoman culture, the offensiveness of the buggering and the longwinded, dry narrations about details of the ancient illustrations negated most of my positive feelings about this book. The second star and a half is based solely on being impressed with the quality of mystery and the author being able to carry-off the multiple first-person POVs.. 2.5 stars","Dec 10, 2011"

1108123,Bettie,"Re-read via BBC:. BBC blurb -. The novel is a complicated mixture of murder mystery, fairy tale and exploration of the medieval world of the Turkish miniaturist painter.. The novel begins - surreally - from the point of view of the murdered man; his body thrown down the bottom of a well, he waits for this death to be discovered. The story is then taken up by a myriad of characters, which include a coin and a horse, as well as the colour Red itself. They recount a chapter at least each - in fact this book has twenty narrators and yet, as James Naughtie and readers testify, it is a page-turner.. My Name is Red is the most popular of Pamuk's in the English speaking world, due he says to the whodunnit element, but also to the global appeal of the art.. Orhan Pamuk discloses how as a young man he longed to be a painter, and so as a successful writer, it was a natural progression to write about the joys of painting, and to explore how an artist feels as their hands move across the page.. His reputation as the funny man of his family is also in evidence. Despite his intellectual credentials, humour is an important tool for him. He says he doesn't like writing a serious book, and if the reader isn't smiling when he reads his work, then he feels guilty.. It doesn't work so well outside of the paper version - it is the footnotes that hold the clues, so I urge you to engage in the traditional manner: comfy chair, fireside, glass of wine, and the paper book on your lap.","Apr 23, 2008"
33119635,Neil,"The main theme of this book is the threatened ""westernisation"" of Ottoman art, but it also includes a murder mystery and a love story. There are some long passages about the differences between the two artistic movements and some long philosophical/religious discussions. But these are interspersed with chapters that progress both the love story and murder mystery. For me, the middle of the book got a bit weighed down with the art discussions, but it is undoubtedly a book that gives someone like me from a western background and with little knowledge of eastern art plenty to think about.. It's not the simplest book in the world to read. Each chapter is narrated in the first person but by one of, I think, 12 different narrators. It is also self-consciously a book in several places with the narrator directly addressing the reader. Some of the narrators are not human. So, it can be difficult to keep track of exactly who is talking, but if you keep on top of that, then the format works well in giving you a variety of perspectives on the developing stories. I like the almost throwaway comment towards the end that we maybe shouldn't rely completely on the person who has pulled the story together!. A though-provoking read that was only spoiled for me by being a bit long-winded in the middle section.","Nov 06, 2016"
28134808,Nabilah Firdaus,"Work of art. A remarkable postmodern novel about late middle age Ottoman Empire, specifically in art. This book wasn't easy to read, honestly. It's richly written, multi-layered, full of philosophical and historical discussion. It is a curious mix of overaching murder mystery, religion, Islamic art and its miniaturists, and Western invasions of art and technology.The differences between Western Christian and Islamic perceptions of art and aesthetics covered in this book were certainly interesting and beautiful. It's also a tale of love in its various hues - between a father and a daughter, a mother and her children, a master and his students, and between friends. I especially like the way the story is narrated. It uses the first person view from different characters and even objects in the story. The tree, the dog, the coin, the horse, the Satan (I love this one the most). Elegant and fascinating symbolism. Recommended; this book would primarily appeal to admirers of art and historical fiction.. P/S: Need to read Umberto Eco's The Name of The Rose because I have been told that My Name Is Red bears many resemblances to the book.","Jun 23, 2018"
5041353,Jim,"I read this book over a period of several months. I don't think it is a book to be read quickly but one to be sipped slowly like a good cognac. Pamuk's style is very different to Western authors. This is a dense, atmospheric book, which demands a high level of patience and attention from the reader, perhaps mirroring the patience of the Turkish miniaturists illustrating the book celebrating the Sultan's life. Black Effendi, newly returned from exile, is set the task of finding the murderer of one of the illustrators by his uncle, for whom the victim was working when he was killed. Written in the first person, with multiple narratives, this is a book full of unreliable witnesses, the first narrator is strangely a corpse at the bottom of a well (Elegant Effendi) and as the various stories of the narrators unfold, the truth slowly emerges. It would have been nice to have some illustrations in the book, though the pictures Pamuk conjures in the reader's mind are vivid.","Aug 25, 2011"
115473,Siria,"A triumph of hype over substance, I thought. I'm not sure whether this is because of Pamuk himself, or whether the astonishingly stiff and formal style of the narrative can be attributed to the translator, but I was very much underwhelmed by this. The aspects of the novel which covered the differences between Western Christian and Islamic perceptions of art and aesthetics were certainly interesting; there were also some moments of true inventiveness and creativity, such as the chapters which were narrated from the point of view of a sketch of a dog, or the colour red. For the most part, though, I found the characters unengaging, flat and irritating, with Pamuk liking to show off, almost, through them. It's a very uneven mix of dialogue, plot, history and theology, and while not a bad novel, per se, I really don't think I'll ever be coming back to it.","Jun 05, 2007"

59510944,Anima,"‘Four years after I first left Istanbul, while traveling through the endless steppes, snow-covered mountains and melancholy cities of Persia, carrying letters and collecting taxes, I admitted to myself that I was slowly forgetting the face of the childhood love I’d left behind. With growing panic, I tried desperately to remember her, only to realize that despite love, a face long not seen finally fades. During the sixth year I spent in the East, traveling or working as a secretary in the service of pashas, I knew that the face I imagined was no longer that of my beloved. Later, in the eighth year, I forgot what I’d mistakenly called to mind in the sixth, and again visualized a completely different countenance. In this way, by the twelfth year, when I returned to my city at the age of thirty-six, I was painfully aware that my beloved’s face had long since escaped me.. ..... The pickle seller who passionately informed me about the cleric from Erzurum said that the counterfeit coins—the new ducats, the fake florins stamped with lions and the Ottoman coins with their ever-decreasing silver content—that flooded the markets and bazaars, just like the Circassians, Abkhazians, Mingarians, Bosnians, Georgians and Armenians who filled the streets, were dragging us toward an absolute degradation from which it would be difficult to escape. I was told that scoundrels and rebels were gathering in coffeehouses and proselytizing until dawn; that destitute men of dubious character, opium-addicted madmen and followers of the outlawed Kalenderi dervish sect, claiming to be on Allah’s path, would spend their nights in dervish houses dancing to music, piercing themselves with skewers and engaging in all manner of depravity, before brutally fucking each other and any boys they could find.‘","Mar 31, 2019"
5571752,Hafizz Nasri,"This book is lengthy and freaking detailed- I honestly had to re-read few chapters at the beginning cause I'm quite clueless with the story line at first.. In love with the writings anyway. Love how Pamuk separated each character to each chapter. I got myself a different vision every time, perspectives and those feels (especially during Shekure's chapters). Question and puzzle, a corpse lying inside a well memorizing his life and the murderer who did it to him, and how the story goes revealing details of each, vividly.. Story telling was done impressively, quite imaginary actually, I didn't expect myself to love reading about master miniaturists past and current (to the book scene) history-- those stories of Hüsrev and Shirin and the famous Persian painter Bihzad were really magnificent. I love the part where Black went to visit Butterfly, Stork and Olive asking them questions and got himself a bunch of stories about signature and style, painting and time as well as blindness and memory (this was my favorite). It was lovely to know few secrets and scandals and the exploration of these miniaturist's artworks.. Most interestingly, Pamuk gave life to certain objects/drawings during the story ride it gave me chills when I read it. My most favorite would be the gold coin and horse (and you get 'death' and 'Satan' as well). As non-human narrators it gave soul to this book, along the journey I could see how it was all related to each other, in such a way, so beautifully.. A living picture of Istanbul in year of 1950s, rich representation of Ottoman Empire, story of miniaturists, a murder mystery with love and friendship in between, and its astonishing finding. I was actually right about the murderer but later I thought I was wrong cause the story suddenly playing hints and such that I go ah damn it who the heck are you!. What a great reading journey (minus the clueless me at the beginning), my first Pamuk anyway and love it. ""I bring my color to the page, it's as if I command the world to 'Be!' Yes, those who cannot see would deny it, but the truth is I can be found everywhere.""","Jul 26, 2017"
11351200,Leslie,"John Lee gives an excellent narration for this historical fiction novel.. I knew a small amount about the 16th century Ottoman Empire so found the dispute between traditional Islamic artistic style and the 'new' Frankish style of more realistic imagery fascinating. Some might not care for the way the story is told from many perspectives (including a corpse in the opening chapter, a dog and a counterfeit coin) but I liked the way each narrator gives a different side of life at this time in Istanbul. And being a mystery buff, I liked the way the murderer gave his parts with subtle clues but I was still guessing right up to the end!. What was less to my taste (but an important part of the book) was the sometimes lengthy discussions about various famous (?) artists and their works & how art fit into the Muslim religion. These sections would have been better for me in written (rather than audio) form - the Arabic and Turkish names were sometimes difficult to identify and remember (and I can't flip back and refresh my memory with a digital audiobook the way I could in print or even ebook form).","Nov 13, 2016"
31789152,Sikata,"I am so fortunate to be red! I'm fiery. I'm strong. I know men take notice of me and that I cannot be resisted. Any art lovers out there? More specifically, art historians? Then welcome to your next read. Set in sixteenth century Istanbul, this book elicits the power and significance of art and books. The capability to illustrate something that incites love, sadness, happiness, devotion, lust, jealousy and anger that provoked wars and what not. The work of many renowned illustrators like Bizhad have been laid out in detail.. The book starts a tad slow for my taste but then it had me wrapped up in it's pages. The book keeps you guessing who the murderer is till the very end even with the author taking us on a stroll into the very dark crevices his of mind (maybe the multiple unrelated stories served the purpose of keeping us off track? 🤔). Contrary to what is commonly believed, all murderers are men of extreme faith rather than unbelievers. The inference of religion by people and tarnishing them altogether isn't new. This way the book connects history with present day too. The book is quite detailed to be an illustration in itself only through words.. I admired Shekure's strength and wit. Though she does come across as harsh at times, she just didn't have any other choice. The hardship of being a widowed mother in a patriarchal society is understandable. While Black was just a poor lady caught in the web of murder and deception to attain the love of his life. It's very 'channa mereya' in the beginning 😁 (me being Desi). That's basically all I can say for now having just finished this book. I took off a star for certain parts which didn't deem necessary. It caused the story to drag a bit.. An illustration that does not complement a story, in the end, will become but a false idol. Since we cannot possibly believe in an absent story, we will naturally begin believing in the picture itself","Apr 14, 2019"
4277669,Caitlin,"“My Name is Red” is a remarkable postmodern novel about the late middle age Ottoman Empire. It is told in a claustrophobic way through the personas of some 14 narrators. Pamuk weaves an intricate murder mystery through these narrators to tell a somewhat incestuous story of Islamic miniaturists, Western invasions of art and technology, a tortured love story and the overarching murder that ties everything and everyone together.. There are four artists working on a secret book for the Sultan in celebration of the 1,000th year of the Hajj (the start of the Muslim calendar). Elegant, Stork, Olive, and Butterfly. Elegant is murdered in the first chapter and the rest of the book is about discovering why he was murdered and who the murderer was. The only thing the reader knows is that it is a fellow artist because the murder says so in his chapters. Some of the narrators are extremely unreliable by telling lies and then admitting that they were lying, etc. It is frustrating at times but adds to the mystery.. There is also a love story. Aside from the miniaturists, the other main characters are Enishte, who the Sultan hires to make the book, his daughter Shekure and his nephew Black. Black is in love with Shekure and wants to marry her but she has a husband who is presumed dead as he did not come back from the Persian war, four years previous. I had sympathy for Shekure’s situation, because of the conservative nature of Ottoman law and Islamic law, she is considered the property of her husband and she cannot get a divorce because there is no proof he is dead. This is keeping her in the grips of her creepy brother-in-law who is obsessed with her. But I could not sympathize with her as a person. She may have been in an impossible situation but she plays with Black’s heart and manipulates him, as well as everyone else around her. Still, the argument can be made that her feminine wiles are the only thing keeping her and her children safe. At times her story is moving, at other times it is distracting from the rest of the novel.. The heart of the novel is not really about the murder or detective work at all. It is about art, its value, its meaning, how it should be made, etc. The brilliance of Pamuk’s novel is that it reveals explicitly but poetically why there is a clash between Western and Islamic mores when it comes to freedom of expression and art. The Ottoman and Islamic way of life is threatened by the encroachment of the “Frankish” way of art. Enishte had seen Venetian paintings and wanted to learn art their way. But to the Muslims this is abhorrent. This is the source of the strife in the novel, the very reason Elegant is murdered.. It brings to mind the murders that have happened in recent months and years when Mohammad is depicted, particularly when he is being mocked. Pamuk uses his characters to explain to the Western reader why portraits, the use of perspective, and having a distinctive style are considered blasphemous to the Islamic mind. It is a true culture clash, the West has always surrounded itself with true depictions and material objects, the Muslims see that as man being arrogant, trying to outdo Allah, the only true Creator. For the Persian artists that the Ottoman artists admire and copy, the highest form of art is when they inevitably go blind and then paint from memory, that is when they are closest to Allah’s vision of the world. It is a way for them to be inline with their God. This mystical idea of blindness was intriguing and terrifying, I fear going blind, I could not imagine craving it, or even deliberately causing it because of a spiritual connection. But that is how much their cultural style of art means to them. While it seems insane in the modern day West, understanding the true significance of what a representation of Mohammad means to a Muslim, explains why violence erupts when individual violent-minded people are provoked.. Pamuk is not condoning this, nor am I. I think he is just explaining it. The deeper I got into the book the more sardonic the tone seemed. He is critical of the Western way and the Islamic way. This book feels like the beginning of a conversation about the way Muslims gets meaning out of art and life. It is also a historical novel about how European influences really were one of the downfalls of the Ottomans, they couldn’t keep up technologically or with the modern way of thinking.. It is a very entertaining novel with a satisfying, if somewhat melancholy, ending. But the real treasure is learning about a whole different way to look at the age old question, “does art imitate life, or life imitate art?”","Apr 19, 2015"
1758411,Lisa,"My Name is Red. is another book that indulges my interest in illuminated illustration. I bought it ages ago when it won the IMPAC prize in 2003, but although Pamuk has since become one of those authors whose books I try always to read, until now I had never got round to reading the one that made him famous to ordinary readers in the Anglosphere. It’s taken me ages to read it, because I as-good-as read it twice, backtracking over the chapters as I fitted the pieces of the puzzle together but also as I formed a more coherent understanding of the principles of Ottoman art in the 16th century.. The novel is a murder mystery in the style of Umberto Eco’s. The Name of the Rose. or Iain Pears’. An Instance of the Fingerpost. but it’s also a love story and a meditation on a transitional period in Ottoman art. At the same time it also explores one of Pamuk’s central preoccupations: the contest between modernity and tradition; and between the West and Islam. He does this through an exploration of the Islamic art of miniatures, setting his novel among master miniaturists under the leadership of Master Osman, a character based on the real life Nakkaş Osman, the chief miniaturist of the Ottoman region in the 16th century.. When I visited the Alhambra in Granada, I wasn’t all that excited about Islamic art because representation of the human form was not allowed and my interest waned after a few chambers of what looked to me like endless repetitions. But actually Ottoman art covered a vast area, and it was influenced by Persian and Chinese art, as well as the Franks and the Venetians with whom the Ottomans were consorting as they conquered bits and pieces of Europe. There was also a significant difference between public art, and the exquisite. private. artworks commissioned by successive Sultans who liked, as rulers do, to acquire self-aggrandising artworks that feature their importance. So it’s not at all surprising that when the Sultan of Pamuk’s novel caught up with the idea of Renaissance portraiture from Genoa and Venice, he liked the idea of a portrait, accompanied by items significant in his life as a demonstration of his power and majesty..

Invitation to World Literature. , which dedicated an entire lesson to this book. Several university literature professors as well as the translator and the author himself enthusiastically talked it up and, after 30 minutes, I was more than eager to read “My Name is Red”. I was certain I would LOVE this murder mystery set in 16th-century Istanbul with a cast of characters consisting mostly of artists.. The literary devise of having the story told by a number of different characters, beginning with the corpse of the murdered artist and including a dog, a picture of a tree, a coin, Death, Satan and even the color red, seemed to be a winning formula. The writing was beautiful and I immediately began highlighting sentence after sentence so I could come back to read them and share them with friends. For example:. “I don't want to be a tree; I want to be its meaning.”. “Painting is the silence of thought and the music of sight.”. “A letter doesn't communicate by words alone. A letter, just like a book, can be read by smelling it, touching it and fondling it. Thereby, intelligent folk will say, 'Go on then, read what the letter tells you!' whereas the dull-witted will say, 'Go on then, read what he's written!”. But, although I was in awe of the profound snippets of philosophy and social commentary, I soon lost my enthusiasm for the “story”, and at the 40% mark, I still didn’t care about any of the characters.. I’m not giving up on “My Name is Red” completely, because there are parts that are brilliant. Maybe I’m just not in the proper frame of mind for this right now, so I’ll shelve it for now and give it another chance in a few months.. P.S.

My name is Red is all the more philosophical than it is mysterious, all the more informative than it is entertaining..or one more than the other. The book deals with the life of miniaturists who struggled between adopting the styles of their old masters and Venetian artists and how this very conflict led the miniaturists to succumb to a slow death of their art leaving the remnants to be left forgotten in the realm of time. Apart from many reasons why this book has been more than an exciting novel for me is, being a contemporary work as it is, it has helped me to refresh my faith in a beautiful, inspirational way. I couldn't have had a more liberal experience of relating Koran's verses in many life long situations as described by the author. My favorite being the narrative of a dog who sounds out from Koran his miseries and sorrows especially since dog is generally abhorred in an Islamic society as a filthy animal. The tout ensemble of characters has been as usual astounding and the protracted narrative as directed by the author individually for each character led to a verisimilitude of courtroom where reader is the judge or in a similar way God judges us all..

1927524,Nick,"I have been late to join the Orhan Pamuk bandwagon. In fact, I suspect I never will. I approached “My Name is Red” with an affection for the historical novel, as well as for novels with many narrators. “My Name is Red” makes me question both. Technically, it is virtuosic. It effectively evokes fifteenth century Istanbul, and makes an important plot device—and more important, makes intelligible—the complex debate of Islamic belief and art, especially regarding the representation of human beings. It asks big questions about art and history and religion. There is even a murder mystery, although an anemic one, and the fulfillment of a great lost love hangs in the balance. It has modernist tricks galore—chapters or parts of them are narrated by death, a coin, by the color red (hence, the title), a tree, a dog, a horse (rather, the idea of a horse, since that particular narrator ruminates on being depicted over the centuries), Satan, and a severed head.

This book has the capability to take the readers from ""wow"", with its sheer brilliance ,to ""duh"", thrusting them into plunging ennui, in matter of pages.. What this book is about - a passionate love story or just a tale of lust and selfishness, a suspenseful murder mystery or a predictable drag, on art and artistry or painter's dilemma - is hard to decide.. Undoubtedly, it created an impact on my mind with its unique narration style, where men, animals, objects and concepts, each become a different voice to tell the tale from their 'vantage point'. Also, it introduced me to the Islamic world of the medieval period and Istanbul (how I wish to visit that city now) in particular.. But it failed to ignite a spark in me to have great appreciation for art and miniatures, which probably was one of its intent, courtesy of its dry and repetitive writing..

Very odd to have someone proclaim his praises to God or Allah in this case, and then recall how lovely it was to bugger the pretty boys.. The book is told through the eyes of several narrators - the miniaturists, their master, some of the subjects of the illustration, a matchmaker, the love interest of one of the Black, her father and the murderer (who is also one of the above). Thank heavens for the sections from Esther, Shekure and Satan et. al because the others are so tedious with their bantering about whether an artist should have a style and about blindness that I wanted to take an elaborately jeweled pin and jab it in my (well, maybe not mine - but somebody’s) eyes.","Oct 02, 2007"

1188122,Kara Babcock,"This is the second work of historical fiction I’ve read in a month that has a colour in its title and features art as a significant component of its story. The other,. Sacré Bleu. , was an irreverent “comedy d’art” by Christopher Moore.. My Name is Red. definitely isn’t that. Good thing I like to read widely!. My Name is Red. opens with the voice of a dead man. Elegant Effendi describes the sensations of knowing he is dead, of his spirit decoupling from his body. He hopes his murderer will be found and brought to justice (the more creative the better). From there, Orhan Pamuk goes on to hop perspectives every chapter, weaving a story of magic and mystery in sixteenth-century Istanbul. Centred around a workshop of miniaturists who are working on a somewhat controversial book for the Sultan,. My Name is Red. dips into some of the questions raised in the sixteenth century as the Ottoman Empire continued to coexist uneasily next to the Christian nations of Western Europe. The time is the past and the setting is, as always, that battleground between change and tradition.. This book reminds me a lot of. The Name of the Rose. . Superficially they have so many similarities: both are translations, one from Turkish and one from Italian. Both are set in the past and involve a murder mystery. Both are written in a style that is, if not challenging, then definitely demanding of one’s full attention. Beyond the surface, though, the striking similarities continue: both of these novels are about the tension between different schools of thought. In. The Name of the Rose. it’s the growing chasm between science and religion, between the empirical principles of Bacon and Occam and the spiritual communion of the Franciscans and Dominicans. In. My Name is Red. it’s the clash between the older, traditional ways of depicting people in Islamic art and the new style imported from Venice—a style that, some worry, comes too close to the real thing. And in both these novels, the murders are inextricably linked to these questions of style, change, and tradition.. I can see why many people express frustration over this book’s narration. It’s not the easiest book to read. Translated from Turkish,. My Name is Red. doesn’t always have the same kind of unity and coherence that a novel originally written in English might have. Moreover, Pamuk has very little time for dialogue. Most of the book is either description or introspection from the narrator to the reader.. My Name is Red. reminds me of a stage play. In each scene, several actors would be in tableaux while the narrator of the scene delivers an extensive monologue. Then, with a flourish, he or she triggers the action, the other actors unfreeze, and the plot drags forward for a few minutes before the narrator re-assumes control. Although i understand why some people see the narrators as flat, I thought the moments when they comment on their actions, their drawings or letter-writing or courting, were quite confessional. Just the character and I in a musty, dark room, as the character hurriedly scribbles out the journal of their last days. One of them is a murderer ….. Thanks to the way Pamuk structures the novel, attempting to discover the identity of the murderer is half the fun. The murderer narrates both as himself and as his ordinary miniaturist alter ego, always careful never to reveal anything about his actions as a miniaturist that would shed light on his identity. So, for example, Pamuk has each of the three suspect miniaturists tell three parables labelled Aliph, Bet, Djim, allowing the murderer to refer to these stories without revealing which miniaturist he is. But the clues are there, getting louder as the novel approaches the climax and the identity of the murderer is revealed. I was sure it was one miniaturist pretty early on—and I was wrong. So it goes.. The miniaturists’ chapters are also very interesting looks at the ongoing debate regarding Islamic versus Western art. Is it sacrilege to paint in the Frankish style? What. is. style, anyway? Is it sacrilege to have one’s own style, rather than labouring to faithfully reproduce the old pieces as flawlessly as possible? True flawlessness, of course, just like true creativity, is the domain of Allah and not something a mere human artist could achieve. These questions spill over beyond the miniaturists’ chapters, however, and into the concurrent love story between Shekure and Black and the murder mystery itself. The ideas Pamuk juggles are particularly appropriate to the context of the story, but they are timeless and still relevant today.. Above all else, Pamuk manages to convey how. personal. the process of making and rendering art can be. Making art is a thoughtful, time-consuming activity that can be as emotionally draining as it is physically. The crises of faith experienced in. My Name is Red. are all too real. They happen as a result of the expression of self necessary for art to be possible: what you make, and how you make it, says something about yourself and your convictions, what you believe and the values you hold dear. To set that down on paper, in ink, in stone, on canvas, for others to view and discuss and rip apart … it’s a little terrifying. Worse still, in the act of such creation, you begin to think about these beliefs and sometimes even question them—or, through the influence of other creators, you realize that there are other sets of beliefs out there. Which ones are true, better, practical, enriching, etc.? Does it even matter?. So, you know, art is serious business. Serious enough in this case that someone was willing to kill Elegant Effendi for questioning if what they were doing was compatible with the wishes of Allah. On one hand, such actions seem like the same old, same old internecine and destructive effects of organized religion—but that would be a disingenuous and uncharitable evaluation. For on the other hand, the conflict in. My Name is Red. is less about religion and more about personal values that hinge upon the intersection of history, politics, faith, and art.. It took me a while to read. My Name is Red. , partly because I did so while moving to another country and partly because of its heavily stylized narration. But read it I did. While it did not necessarily excite me or enthrall me in the same way. The Name of the Rose. did, its meditations on the nature of art and artistry, style and sacrilege and sacrifice, are still interesting. It is a deep and thoughtful book; as long as you are willing to spend the time and effort on it, it is also a rewarding one.","Aug 23, 2012"
8604691,Steve Middendorf,"I took me two full 3 week loans and an email saying we're about to start discussing our next book to get me to finish it. Why? I’m a fast reader. This is favoured subject matter and an author who made me fall in love with Melvet, the Boza seller. Why couldn’t I stay with this book? Was there a message I didn’t want to hear?. I have been of the mind that much that is wrong with the East can be blamed on the West. Exploitation, colonialism, hegemony, militarism, orientalism, Sykes-Picot, the Balfour Declaration, the Mordad Coup, the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq and other forms of meddling have been in my diet.. Now a little known Turkish art historian, Orhan Pamuk (who also writes books) has opened the door marked c-d. Cognitive dissonance. Pamuk introduces us to the world of the Islamic court painters. It’s 1576. Suleyman the Magnificient had laid siege to Vienna and had captured Baghdad from the Persians. Istanbul was at its heights, but a cultural war was raging. Whose art was best? The Franks (Venetians) on the left, or the Persians on the right? Pamuk is very crafty-- he studied to be an artist after all. And like the professor who preys on college sophomores, he makes us fall in love with Islamic miniature art. This is art history in words. He shows us no paintings. Our fellow travellers will supply… or google it. And we do fall in love.. While a murder mystery goes on in the background, we see a society of artists, dominated by faith, confront their enemies of the easel. Because we are in love, we are greatly sympathetic. Pamuk the subversive! We do not see the work of Leonardo or Raphael or Michelangelo. No one supplies it! But we do get the local reactions: to Bellini and Titian and the portrait artists of Venice, the infidels who:. “...had discovered painting techniques with which they could distinguish any one man from another—without relying on his outfit or medals, just by the distinctive shape of his face.”. I noticed ReemK10 liked Fionnuala's review of Alison Cole's Italian Renaissance Courts: Art, Pleasure and Power. It was a lovely review wasn't it? I was struck by the connections and the overlaps between the two books. Both deal with art of course, but come at their subject from competing cultures and ideologies. (Rebecca Johnson's Foreword to Leg Over Leg describes an active, seesaw, cultural competition.) Alison Cole’s author page lists two books: Color and Perspective. How much fun it would be to technically compare the art of Turkey and the art of the Italian Renaissance for the same period. Edward Said, cover your eyes. As we trace the murderers of Black Effendi, the architecture in the story gradually deteriorates, and so too does our perception of Islamic art. The author seems to say that while Persian art may be better than the Turkish art, Italian art is of a different, more advanced nature. There is no competing with Renaissance man, freed from the strictures and politics of religious belief. I had the thought that my enjoyment of this book would have been much improved by the inclusion of examples of miniaturist art. Then I went to ReemK10's review of the book and found all these sublime miniaturist plates. How lovingly crafted! Thank you. Some reviews are as beautiful as their subject matter. I am in awe of the valuable content my friends leave behind here.","Nov 15, 2018"
220791,Lena,"My Name is Red is set in sixteenth-century Istanbul. There, a group of master miniaturists have been secretly commissioned to create a book using painting techniques from Western art. The book is nearing completion when one of the miniaturists suddenly turns up dead.. The story of the murder investigation unfolds slowly alongside that of a romance between another miniaturist who is trying to solve it and the daughter of the man responsible for commissioning the book. Each chapter is told in a different voice, beginning with the corpse of the murdered man and moving through many characters including all of the other miniaturists, the daughter, her lover, and several of the illustrations that populate the books themselves.. This is an ornate, elaborate read, one in which the author spends a great deal of time meticulously describing the paintings that are being worked on and viewed throughout the course of the story. There is also a fair amount of philosophical discussion about the nature of visual art and in particular the differences between the Islamic styles in which the miniaturists were accustomed to working and the new ""Venetian"" style that many considered blasphemous. These latter sections were among the most enjoyable for me in the book.. While some parts of the story were quite interesting to me, I found that overall this book was not to my taste. At first, the author's meticulous attention to detail felt luxurious and opulent. As the tale progressed, however, I found myself losing patience with his pages and pages of elaborate description; there are only so many ways to describe a painting, and his insistence on doing so repeatedly slowed the story down considerably. In addition, the constant changing of voices left me feeling detached from the events described, as no sooner had I gotten involved with one character's perspective than I was forced to change to another. This might have worked better if the characters themselves had been more sympathetic, but for the most part, the people who populated this story were not individuals I particularly liked.. I finished the book mostly to discover the resolution of the murder and the love story, which was satisfying enough. But I ultimately didn't enjoy the journey as much as I'd expected to given the book's promising combination of elements. If Goodreads had half stars, I'd probably rate it 2.5; as it stands, I'd recommend it mainly for readers with an interest in visual art, Turkish history, and a great deal of patience.","Oct 24, 2008"
6491886,Sarah Goodwin,"Worst book of 2014 so far.. I had to read this for class and found myself wondering what the point of it all was. The so called 'thrilling murder mystery' element is drawn out and dull, because we don't really know the murder victim, or the killer sufficiently well to be invested in justice or understanding. Black, who is pretty much the main character, is dull and fairly two dimensional - he wants the girl of his dreams and doesn't want to get executed or tortured.. The book would also be half the length if it wasn't filled with repetative 'lessons' on style, blindness and the drawing of horses. Obviously someone thought that was worth it winning the biggest prize out there, but for regular readers, all this 'meaningful' stuff is just a delaying tactic for a semi-interesting story. Especially when you know that there are 3 artists, who will all be telling three stories in the next few chapters, my attention wandered far away.. Aside from all this, there is something basically uninteresting about the prose style, which is monotonous and often uses repeated words in the same sentance.. In the end, the reveal of the murderer left me thinking 'so what?' there is no 'love story' to speak of, and I'm starting to think whoever wrote the blurb never finished, or even picked up the book.","Mar 06, 2014"
53055819,Abbie | ab_reads,"This month Alex and I headed to Turkey with Orhan Pamuk's 'My Name Is Red', and I think it's safe to say we weren't particularly enamoured with this book.... But I don't want to be all doom and gloom because there were some parts that I liked about the book! The narration was fun, as it flits from several different perspectives with short chapters, which helps alleviate the heaviness. Some of my favourite chapters were narrated by a coin, a tree, and a corpse, and I also liked the chapters narrated by the women of the story. There were also some gorgeous details about the art and culture of 16th century Istanbul.. Unfortunately, too much of this book was detail, so much so that the story was just lost in a sea of excruciatingly precise descriptions of illustrations and art techniques. It dragged. I found myself skimming so many passages just to get back to the story, which isn't what you want. I also found it difficult to overcome some of the cultural differences that came with the time and country, such as how women were treated as possessions and had little or no voice.. Overall, I think I'd recommend this book to you only if you had a specific interest in Turkish history or the history of illumination and illustration.","Sep 14, 2017"
4810137,Arda,"Work of art.. I am a corpse.. I am a dog.. A tree.. A murderer.. A silver coin.. A woman..... Miniturists, Islam, death, after-death, murder, mystery. The book is a MYSTERY.. Other themes: Blindness, East/West, Signing name.. Loaded with stories especially from Turkey and Persia. It has some funny parts too. I especially enjoyed the dog's defense from animosity towards dogs in Islam, the coin's perspective, and Satan's ideas. The ending was strange/daring (a blow-job?!) and Shekure - one of the characters, turns out to be talking about her second younger son Orhan: ""For the sake of a delightful and convincing story, there isn't a lie Orhan wouldn't deign to tell."".

14943717,Indrani Sen,"A book I feel ill-equipped to review. I loved the story about the daily life of miniaturists in Istanbul. Their dedication to their art, the conflict of their work with their religion, their day-to-day competitions with each other are extremely well depicted. The love story left me slightly cold though it is real enough, being full of frailty and manipulations. The mystery again was, for me, not that gripping.

900800,Inderjit Sanghera,"‘My Name is Red’ is an exploration of the aesthetic differences between Western and Islamic art and culture, masquerading by that most Western of literary concepts; the detective story. ‘My Name is Red’, however, constantly subverts murder mystery tropes; the murder victims form two of the many narrators yet they never reveal who the murderer is, the murderer is also a narrator and he constantly talks to and goads the reader-Pamuk is able to synthesise post-modern literary techniques such as metafiction and unreliable narrators with a story that explores the art of Ottoman miniature, an antiquated, though sophisticated, form of art, though one which rejected the ideals of realism and individuality of Western renaissance painting, in favour of a kind of religious abstraction which would allow the viewers to glimpse how god conceives the world.. The novel is set during a harsh winter in Istanbul and Pamuk is able to capture its verdant atmosphere, the steady somnolent fall of snow which engulfs Istanbul echoes the iridescent beauty of Istanbul; from the incandescent moonlight to the suffocating alley-ways, many of Pamuk’s descriptions read like miniaturist paintings;. “Every detail, the finely wrought wall, window and frame ornamentation, the curves and circular designs in the red rug, the colour of the silent screen emanating from your clamped throat and the yellow and purple flowers embroidered with incredible finesse and vigour on the magnificent quilt upon which the bare and vile foot of your murderer mercilessly steps as he ends your life, all of these details serve the same purpose: while augmenting the beauty of the painting, they remind you just how exquisite are the room in which you will soon die and the world you will soon leave. The indifference of the painting’s beauty and of the world to your death, in fact of your being totally alone in death despite the presence of your wife, this is the inescapable meaning that escapes you.”. Pamuk not only captures the other-worldly and fantastical nature of miniaturist paintings, but also the symbolised which is deeply rooted in them and which branches out via the myriad of colours which form the basis of the paintings; from the green, blue and reds which dominate the miniaturist paintings, the contours and shades of colour form the basis of the surreal beauty which blazes forth from the miniaturist paintings, the colour red is resplendent with meaning, with mellifluous and yet murderous, it even serves as a narrator in the novel;. “Colour is the touch of an eye, music to the deaf, a word out of the darkness. Because I’ve listened to souls whispering-like the susurrus of the wind-from book to book and object to object for tens of thousands of years, allow me to say that my touch resembles the touch of angels. Part of me, the serious half, calls out to your vision while the mirthful half soars through the air with your glances.”. Colours beautify the world bringing us closer to Allah’s vision of the world, not via the naturalistic recreations of the world which dominated Western painting, which the Ottoman miniaturists felt were a simulacrum of superficial impressions, an insult to the munificence of Allah, but via the intensely emotional and spiritual messages behind the miniaturist paintings, paintings in which the miniaturists would possess such perfect memories and technique that they could recreate paintings even after going blind.. “Oh how might I adequately describe the hues I saw during this exquisite journey? The whole world was made of colour, everything was colour. Just as I sensed the force separating me from all other beings and objects consisted of colour, I now knew that it was colour itself that had affectionately embraced me and bound me to the world. I saw orange-hued skies, beautiful leaf-green bodies, brown eggs and legendary sky-blue horses. The world was faithful to the illustrations and legends I’d avidly scrutinised over the years. I beheld creation with awe and surprise as if for the first time, but also as if it’d somehow emerged from my memory. What I called “memory” contained an entire world: with time spread out infinitely before me in both directions, I understood how the world as I first experienced it could persist afterward as memory. As I died surrounded by this festival of colour, I also discovered why I felt so relaxed, as if I’d been liberated from a strait-jacket: From now on nothing was restricted, and I had unlimited time and space in which to experience all eras and places.”. Repetition and memory formed the cornerstone of miniaturist paintings, paintings were rarely signed as one painting was often the collective effort of several miniaturist painters, and individuality and originality were frowned upon as being discordant with the principles of Ottoman minitaurism, which emphasised the achievement of technical perfection via the endless repetition of the works of old masters. How then, does Pamuk reconcile the originality and individuality of his own art with the ossified and parochial nature of Ottoman minitaurism? Perhaps that is not his purpose, in many ways he wishes to bridge the gap between Western and Arabic art and uses a Western art form to celebrate and give voice to the unique and fantastical beauty of minitaurism, whose beauty was in danger of being lost forever in the vestiges of time, but which Pamuk is able to immortalise, just like the miniaturist painters were sought to immortalise the love between Hüsrev and Shirin.","Apr 10, 2013"
5541253,Amgad Muhammad,"CHAPTER 60. I’M NOT A DOORKNOCKER. Even though my label states that I am, I am definitely not! Another lie by those who see only through their own I’s, but a man who realizes how truth doesn't need to be proven will surely understand the difference between me and a doorknocker. See, my silver disk, coated with a carefully chosen shade of copper and embroidered with a delicate Arabic calligraphy that circulates my center as if it was humbly doing. tawaf. around my flower-shaped handle, might give you the idea of a doorknocker. And from where I’m fixed now, upon a white plain wall, I can understand how a thought like this might come to be. But let’s put me back in my original context.. I don’t belong to a museum wall, I belong to an Islamic complex door. I was fixed to a gorgeous copper door that got shipped to another museum. We all knew this day was coming, that after hundreds of years of unity and cohesion we would get ripped apart by western scholars exactly the way the gold-and-blue. Meshkahs. were ripped from the gold-and-blue ceiling of the Sultan Barquq’s. Madrasah. next door. I've heard my friend got shipped to the museum of David Collection, apparently he was accused of being a doorknob in Sultan Barquq’s Madrasah. I pray for him.. My complex had a Madrasah where gifted Muslims learned Islam and medicine, opposite to a. Bimarestan. were patients got utmost care. With a mosque in between, Muslims would lean on me to take off their worldly needs, as well as their shoes, before they meet Allah and ask for his forgiveness. How I miss the scent of Musk in the old men’s hands when their touch used to glisten my day. But everything went black in the 20's when I got locked in a box and shipped here to Saint Louis art museum. My question to you is this: If I’m truly an exquisite doorknocker, how come no one noticed when I was gone? How come Al-Hajj Abdullah didn't notice that he could no longer hang his Sebha on me while he takes off his shoes?. On your way to the Islamic section you must have passed by the American art gallery. There, you must have stood mesmerized by the talent of a painter in depicting a vase of corn lilies and heliotrope. Remember what the tree said in the 10th chapter about the Venetian painting? “if you depicted one of the trees in this forest, a man who looked upon that painting could come here and, if he so desired, correctly select that tree from among the others”. The painting is not meant to provide you with the joy these lilies bring to butterflies or the love that this heliotrope gives to a new bride. The paint serves only one purpose, to make the painter exceptional and to make society praise its uniqueness. To worship success and achievements and to inspire others to be as unique, successful and worthy of individuals as this painter.. But a flower growing on the borders of Ibnul Qayim books is not meant to be a praise for its artist, rather a praise to the love that nourished the flower to grow. It’s a statement of how enlightening words like those of Ibnul Qayim can harness seeds of faith and turn them into flowers that remain forever grateful to the creator. While a western mind would paint as a lily the most accurate representation of a given existing lily, an eastern heart would draw, with blind eyes, the inward devotion to purity and innocence that a lily, anywhere and anytime, ought to depict.. So am I a doorknocker or am I the representation of the devotion that calligraphers, painters, craftsmen working on copper, glass and wood, architects and other hundred or so artists have come together to create? Am I a doorknocker or your first encounter to a space that cares for the wounds of bodies on the left, while on the right embraces the vulnerabilities of human intellect, and in between, embodies the peace and tranquility that a prayer in his right mind and body will experience once between the hands of the almighty healer?. When the west captivated me in this glass-box they claimed their right to narrate my story, in which they will say that I was “purchased” not stolen, and that I was waiting for my indisputable end if I was kept on that door in Cairo, that here, suffocating in this glass-box, and with the accurately adjusted air conditioner and constant brushing, I’m in a better place. What they refuse to accept as truth and arrogantly wants me to prove, is that when an eastern makes a doorknocker he sublimes to become the doorknocker.. So I’m not a doorknocker, nor its meaning. I’m my artist’s gesture to the truth.. ** 8 months later, I give the book 5 stars **","Dec 15, 2014"
2201886,Mike,"This book was fantastic; it deserves an unqualified ""5"".. I head about this book on the PBS program ""An Invitation to World Literature"" and was intrigued by the description of it and by the fact that it was modern and the living author was brought into the program. Since I knew other books in the series such as ""The Odyssey"", ""The Epic of Gilgamesh"", ""The 1000 and One Nights"", and ""Candide"" I thought it must be very good indeed. Often times such high expectations lead to a disappointment in the actual reading. I am happy to report that ""My Name is Red"" avoid such a fate.. There are some rare books that I as soon as I finish them I think about how the next time I read them I will be able to savor more of the story; its nuances, its details and off-center plots and tidbits. I was anticipating the next reading of this book even while I was only two-thirds of the way through it. It is an incredibly unorthodox book in organization and ""voice"", but at the same time a perfect tale of mystery, human feelings and history. Where else can you find a book that has a talking dog illustration, not to mention a coin or a color? I kept thinking that the word ""lavish"" would be one way to describe it. And it is lavish - it has deep passionate descriptions of illustration (aka Eastern painting) and art. Long and highly specific passages bring to life the craftsmanship and skill that went into legendary books created during the first 1,000 years of Islam.. Whether these books exist in whole or in part today does not matter. Whether the author is or is not an artistic himself does not matter. Indeed, he could have made them up completely; it does not matter. Ultimately it is only the story and how it draws us in and holds our attention that matters to the reader. I, for one, hope that much of what he presents is based in solid historical fact. To my mind that would make the tale even more poignant and compelling. But if every word was make-believe, as we once thought the Iliad was, would not diminish my respect and admiration for Mr. Pamuk. It might even increase them.. I know that not everyone will share my rating this book as a superlative work. I will look at the aggregate rankings after posting this ""review"". Sometimes I am right there with the averages, this time I can image other people not ""getting it"" and giving threes or even twos. For those people I would encourage them to give it a second chance. For every one else, I urge you to get a copy and start reading.. In the theme of ""what have I learned from this book"", I must admit that I knew that Western artists had developed the theories and techniques that created realistic portraiture and perspective. I also knew that early art (Western or Eastern) was ""flatter"" and resembled Chinese painting and illustrations (which I had become more familiar with during the past 15 years or so). What I did not put together (no matter how logical it is) was how Chinese painting and methods moved into neighboring areas and then into the ""core"" of Islamic civilization. Sometimes two plus two just does not compute.. Likewise, the ways in which Islamic artists created their own forms and format (the high horizon and drawing what Allah sees, not the ""real"" thing) were new and very interesting to me. (I am trusting here in the research and historical accuracy of the author. At least the ""Chronology"" gives weight to my belief in him.) I may not seek out a book on Miniaturists or their works any time soon, but it is a very colorful topic.. NB: I carried this book out to Wales on my last business trip and started it on the flight back (after completing two other books despite the 16-18 hour days). I have finished it (and one more if my luck holds) before flying off again. Haven't decided what's making the three week trip, yet. But if I can be ensnared so thoroughly while completely exhausted, then any normal person (book lover) will succumb by just opening the cover!","Jan 29, 2011"
708858,John,"(Apologies – this review didn’t load, somehow, a few days ago when I first posted. All that went up were the stars.). Pamuk tucks together his origami expertly. His narrative skeleton itself emerges as a fascinating combination: there's the murder of a master artist for the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople at the end of the 16th C., folded together w/ the slowly-reignited romance between the widowed Shekure & the man once infatuated w/ her, the Sultan's newly-summoned & more radical painter “Black.” Each 1st-person fold in the tale – for this is historical fiction without the usual Authorial control, historical gone subversive; everyone here speaks for themselves, & everyone slips some new piece of story as the origami goes through additional bending & creasing; there are four or five recurring speakers & a few anomalies – anyway, each protagonist, each visit & revisit to key events, contributes to the creation of cosmopolitan Constantinople (itself a storied meeting-place of the world's far corners), & to the astonishingly intense art history. “Art” in Ottoman Islam proves something over which men might kill each other, & a woman might reinvest her heart. At RED's moment in Islamic history, the hegemony of stylized miniaturism had produced masterpieces, allegories-in-paint re-dramatized by Pamuk thrillingly & wittily, but it was up against a fresh threat, namely, the naturalism out of Renaissance Italy. Even the storyteller in the local coffee-house, he & his bracing new drink as well, looms as a threat to the conservatives among the Believers. So Pamuk extends the folds of his narrative to include himself & his 21st-C. reader, since the struggle in RED between freethinkers & fundamentalists, a struggle that casts its shadow across every clue to the mystery, foreshadows the crisis within contemporary Islam. Not that the connection suffers any galumphing obviousness; it's all brilliantly tucked together. Every story-within-story contributes to resolutions quite perfect in their way, even as they leak a good deal more blood, some of it (as ever in the clash between what’s next & what’s past) innocent blood. Yet I’d say such formal elegance & intellectual grasp, praiseworthy as it is, can be found in less significant books from this man. Pamuk brought off the same sense of the wheel of history turning, & the same unsettling impression that every concluding scene is only another sliding panel, in THE WHITE CASTLE. Yet that novel doesn’t have the impact of MY NAME IS RED, not nearly, & the essential change element is the latter’s book’s powerful woman character. I’m talking about Shekure: daughter, mother, lover, poet, housewife, oracle, widow, Shiva, Savior. And more: the woman's conflicted but willing, confined but worldly, deeply pragmatic yet determined to believe in better. Shekure is the vessel by which Pamuk transcends his brainy command, his structural & stylistic gifts, to achieve a novelistic power at once postmodern & classic. And more: through Shekure he challenges the misogyny that still cripples so many believers in the religion he was born to. He urges his culture towards a more inclusive cosmology.","Aug 04, 2009"
5283293,Cbj,"*** SPOILERS ALERT ***. My Name is Red’s structure reminded me of Chaucer’s poem “The Canterbury Tales”. Each chapter is narrated by a different person or an animal or an object. While “The Canterbury Tales” involves the narration of stories that are not really connected to each other, My Name is Red is a murder mystery where the stories are interconnected and the different narratives help move the story forward.. The novel is set in 16th century Turkey where the miniaturists and religious fundamentalists are concerned about the increasing influence of Venetian and Frankish perspectives of art and life in Turkey. When the Sultan commissions an album of paintings to be made in the Venetian and Frankish styles and appoints Enishte Effendi (an artist who is sympathetic to the European style) to head the project, there is mistrust and paranoia among the miniaturists. The arrival of Black, Enishte’s nephew and his affair with the beautiful and frustrated Shekure (Enishte’s widowed daughter) leads to more intrigue and sexual jealousy. The authorities get involved when a miniaturist involved with the project and the Enishte Effendi are brutally murdered.. I was enamored by most of this novel. But like a better reviewer than me pointed out, the narrative is often paused for the verbal description of art and detailed discussions about the different perspectives of art. I found the long discussions, descriptions and perspectives of art to be repetitive and boring after a certain point. Every single narrator (except for the two females) articulates his point of view on multiple occasions about how every painting need to be made from the perspective of almighty Allah and there is no scope for individuality or signature of the artist in his work. Are these repetitive discussions meant to foreground the theme of the novel? Or are they supposed to emphasize the paranoia of the characters towards European culture? I don’t know.. While it is a murder mystery, every narrative point of view is couched within the perspectives of the different points of view about art. Even the scurrilously funny narrative from the point of view of a fake gold coin. The tone is conversational with some of the narrators addressing the reader directly.. I enjoyed the novel mainly due to the characterization of Shekure. She is a scheming but sexually frustrated woman who hugs and wrestlers with her boys when she feels lonely (there is more than a hint of incest here). Pamuk’s description of the inner life of a socially repressed 16th century Muslim woman is deliberately provocative. Some of the parables were very entertaining and meaningful.. A lot of reviewers on Goodreads seem to be of the opinion that “My Name is Red” is about the conflict between Eastern and Western perspectives about art. But I interpreted it as Orhan Pamuk’s humorous and irreverent castigation of Eastern (in this case Turkish Muslim) perspective about art which was formed by a sense of supremacism, insecurity and paranoia.","Feb 28, 2017"
33440429,Ashish,"Reading this book, my first by Orhan Pamuk, was a long time coming and the company of a read along finally made me take the plunge. What really drew me to the book in the first place was the narrative structure and the interesting first person perspective which keeps switching every chapter. It is a really amazing way to tell a story, especially one which is set in the world of art and speaks a lot about perspective in itself.. On first look, the book is a murder mystery, one which keeps tracks of a bunch of characters and follows them to unravel the murderer in the 3rd act which he has committed in the 1st act. However, as you read it, you see its much more than that. It is a wide-eyed and an in-depth look into the world of art, the miniaturists, the region and time period that was the Ottoman Empire, the cultural and religious idiosyncrasies and how indelibly intertwined that are with the art of the time. It is a really interesting perspective into what art actually means to people and how it is the representation of much more that people and animals and scenes on paper. The book provides tremendous insight into the mystical world of Islamic art and the conflicts that are at the heart of it.. More importantly, the book is a study in character work. It has some of the best and well-fleshed out characters that I have read, they are flawed and conflicted and hence very human. The presence of multiple narrators and their individual perspective helps to draw a fuller character portrayal which is one of the strengths of the book. It also manages to hint at a lot of local mythology and folklore which provides it the air of mysticism and a shroud of the exotic.. The book does a magnificent job at the use of the unreliable narrator and has excellent transitions between time and people, especially by the use of an inanimate narrator in between chapters, which provide a fly-on-the-wall, a wallflower like narrative. My only tiny grouse with the book is that it could have been edited a bit as it tends to get a bit repetitive in its tangents. Maybe it is a limitation of translating a huge book and it does actually add to the aura of the lore, but it is nonetheless an excellent read. I am eagerly waiting to pick up another book by the author to see if he can recreate the magic.","Jun 15, 2017"
51003559,Tamara Agha-Jaffar,"My Name is Red. by. Orhan Pamuk. is a whodunit mystery set in sixteenth-century Istanbul. Pamuk, the 2006 Nobel Prize Winner in Literature, takes us on a labyrinthine journey with interlocking threads of intrigue, love, rivalry, murder—all of which are interspersed with philosophical debates on the function of art and its intersection with religion.. The narrative progresses through the first-person point of view of multiple narrators, some of whom are startling. The opening chapter is in the voice of a corpse. The narrator has just been murdered and thrown down a well. He tells us he is an artist—a miniaturist who paints and embellishes books. Although we learn his murderer is a fellow miniaturist, the identity of the culprit is not revealed until the last pages of the novel. Other speakers include the murderer, fellow miniaturists, their mentors, a matchmaker, lovers, a storyteller, the image of a horse, a dog, a tree, a coin, the color red, death, and Satan. Some of the speakers address the reader directly as if extending an invitation to participate in the debate.. As the narrative gradually unfolds, we listen in on debates about the merits and demerits of eastern vs. western art; the nature of art; the perspective adopted by the artist; whether certain images are idolatrous/anti-Islamic; the artist’s anonymity vs. personal style and self-aggrandizement; artistic styles that have been passed down through the centuries; and vibrant descriptions of beautifully illuminated manuscripts alongside the stories they tell. Weaving in and out of these threads is a love story, a murder mystery that keeps one in suspense, and lamentations for a dying art form. To add complexity to an already complex tapestry, many of the speakers express themselves and answer questions on philosophy, religion, or art by telling stories derived from the cultural fabric of their society.. This is a great novel with a broad sweep that sheds light on a particular period in history while addressing some of the same philosophical, religious, and aesthetic issues we struggle with today. It is a challenging read but well worth the effort.. Highly recommended.","Dec 23, 2017"
3640547,Victoria Evangelina Allen,"~WANDERING THE STREETS~. The beauty of the language enchanted me and I was lost in descriptions of Istanbul, the city I love dearly, the city which is today, in my eyes, is one of the capitals of Islamic Art. The stories of the murdered one, seeking justice; of two love birds, wishing to unite and the history of miniaturist art and apprenticeship of the 16-century Ottoman Empire (now Turkey) and other story lines, narrated by some 10 story-tellers, are masterfully woven in this elaborate, yet easily engaging masterpiece. No wonder that it greatly contributed to Pamuk's Nobel Price winning!. My Name is Red. references a number of books illustrated by famous miniaturists and it was quite a joy for I had seen some of them in museums in Central Asia and elsewhere; and the Khosru and Shireen's love story, which forms the central idea behind the love story in. My Name is Red. , is written by the greatest romantic epic poet in Persian literature: Nezami, who is greatly appreciated, widely-known and much loved in my home-country of Uzbekistan.. Special gratitude to the translator Erdag M. Goknar: the English translation of the book won the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award in 2003. But this beautiful writing is not a quick read: imagine looking at the finest work of miniaturist art with thousands of tiny brush-strokes, relying onto each other in such a way, that if even one of them was missing it would bring the whole great structure down onto its knees. The same with Orhan Pamuk's most talented writing; but once you let yourself free to wander the streets of imagination, vividness and passion of the Ottoman Empire's great city, you'll be smoothly guided to the very end of this suspense murder mystery full of ideas and meditations on the East-West..

181682,Miguel,"Exactly... if I can somewhat parrot what Eric said, I was surprised and disappointed by the reviews of this book on this site. I really have not read a historical fiction that was written in such a stylistically pleasing and creative way; from all kinds of perspectives (My name is death, I am a gold coin, etc etc). It also really reminded me of the Name of the Rose in that the quality of the epic struggle is so finely encapsulated in this book. Struggles over the quest for knowledge, what it means to have a style, coping with resentment and the meaning of faith, as well as the difficulties of the transition from the old paradigm to the new. I believe when you are endeavoring to write a historical fiction you really have to start a new school of thought, and I think great authors (i.e. Eco, Pamuk) just go with it, and interpret history in such a way that they try to create day to day events or a story that takes place within a minute time frame in the expanse of vague historic knowledge. I loved this book.","Sep 06, 2007"
39192152,Ed Yong,"Before selfies, there were portraits; before Facebook, there were diaries. This is a book about the innate egocentrism of humans perfectly reflected in the abundant use of metafiction. It is also rather critical about certain beliefs in Islam. Its depiction of homosexuality and gender invites judgement more than imposing one. The central discussion concerns realism and style in painting and immortality/mortality of painting/style which is also a vehicle for various exploration of humanity. It also talks about influences between artists which is begging for an application of Harold Bloom's theory (which investigates how writers influence and attempt to differentiate from each other).. The tree, the dog, the coin, the horse. Fascinating symbolism. This book is a treasure trove that is worth multiple revisitings. Another big success of this novel is how it justifies the titular inclusion of ""red"". Red is love, Red is death.","Oct 02, 2017"
40889078,Rado Baťo,"Brilliant and stylish take on tensions in a society caused by never ending battle between traditional and modern, the East and the West, local and global. It is set in Ottoman Istanbul of the 16th century, the capitol of the most powerful empire of its time westward of China. Drama is created by the invasion of ""Venetian style"" of painting into the traditional art of Muslim miniaturists who for centuries had been trying to depict reality from ""the perspective of Allah."". This set-up of the book might be medieval (and beautifully sketched) empire, but challenges described by Pamuk are as valid as ever. Maybe history is not repeating itself regularly, but our gut reactions to perceived external threats caused by foreign culture, religion, modernization and globalization are pretty much predictable.","Jan 24, 2017"

1628041,Book Concierge,"Book on CD performed by John Lee. Set in 16th-century Instanbul, this is a murder mystery, an art history lesson, and a love story all in one. The Sultan has commissioned a new book and directs Enishte Effendi to appoint a group of acclaimed miniaturists to illuminate the manuscript “in the style of the Franks.” But figurative art can be seen as an affront to Islam, so it’s a dangerous commission that must remain secret, and no one in the group knows the full scope of the project. When one of the artists disappears, the Sultan demands answers within three days. Was this the work of a devout follower of Islam, or is this a case of jealous rivalry for the hand of Enishte’s beautiful daughter Shekure?. I’ve had this on my tbr for a long time. I really enjoy reading international literature, and this one puts me smack dab into the world of historic Istanbul. But I found it difficult to follow because of Pamuk’s unusual style. Each chapter has a different narrator – including not only the major characters (Black, Shekure, Esther, Butterfly, etc), but a corpse, a tree, a dog, an ancient coin, and even death. Each chapter is written in first person giving the reader only that narrator’s perspective.. When he focuses on the murder and the investigation, the story is quite compelling. However, Pamuk also includes long passages on art, the history of Turkey, and the teachings of Islam. Some of these helped me to understand the culture and the references, but mostly they interrupted the story arc and sometimes had me scratching my head wondering what I had just missed.. The audio book is masterfully performed by John Lee, whose voice reminds me of Jeremy Irons. He really had his job cut out for him, given the style of writing and the many characters. There were times when I had to read the text to be sure I hadn’t missed something. Still, Lee was definitely up to the task. I would rate his narration at 5 stars. Bravo.","Mar 14, 2018"
36586786,Shaima Faisal,"Winter days in Istanbul, the Ottoman Empire in 1591, during the reign of Sultan Murat III.. The Sultan assigned the task of commissioning a book to Enishte Effendi, the father of beautiful Shekure and maternal uncle of Black. The book is supposed to depict the victories and powers of the Ottoman Empire and the Sultan himself, and will be released to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Prophet’s Hijra.. A mysterious murder coincide with the arrival of Black, after 12 year of exile. Now, Enishte Effedi who needs to complete the book before the deadline, assigned Black to replace the murdered miniaturist. In order to gain back Enishte’s and Shekure’s trust and love, Black accepted the challenge.. With the rise of the Erzurumi movement, a group of religious people that oppose illustration altogether considering it as a form of blasphemy, and the confusion and greed that Enishte’s team of miniaturist face because they are used to and was trained to illuminate using the Ottoman style but asked to adopt the Frankish style in illustrations within the book, another crime occurs.. A parallel line in the novel is the love story of Black and Shekure, a reflection of the tragic romance story of Hüsrev and Shirin, borrowed from the famous epic “Shahnameh Dear ” written by Ferdousi and elaborated by Nezami in his “Panj Ganj/Khamsa”. The tragic ending of Chief Miniaturist Master Osman emulating the blindness of the legendary miniaturist Bihzad represents the end of the Ottoman miniature because after that, the miniaturists follow the Frankish style.. The novel is heavy and dense with details and metaphors. I felt sorry for myself because I should have read the “Shahnameh” beforehand. Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading it. Pamuk reminded me of Eco in “The Name of The Rose”. Ok, this is my first experience with Pamuk, and surely will not be the last.","Jul 22, 2018"
3007716,Meg,"My Name is Red. my first stray into Turkish fiction so I'm not sure if the resonance the themes had with me had more to do with Orhan Pamuk's personal preoccupations or Turkey's wider preoccupations as a society and culture. Probably both, since by dint of geography and history, Turkey becomes the stage for competing influences from Europe and Asia. I wonder why I never realized before that Turkish literature might be the best place to find works expressing this existential angst of being caught between East and West, which is kind of the basis of my identity, if we're getting armchair psychologist here. I gotta to say to all these characters in. My Name is Red. being torn apart having to deal with the friction between eastern and western traditions and struggling to re-negotiate their identity: I get it. I feel y'all. It was so nice to see this played out in literature!. The murderer in. My Name is Red. --a miniaturist painter who kills two other artists over a book threatening to introduce the western philosophy of painting to Turkish painting -- is especially fascinating. He's of course driven by feelings of superiority and rage, which are emotional motives. But his intellectual reasons are fascinating: both wanting to cling to tradition and wanting to discard it, wanting to be part of a society that values the collective ( which he grew up in) while secretly wanting to be part of society that places the individual above all else. Who doesn't want to believe they are unique and special? Such is the siren song of individualism. A tempting enough creed to anyone with an ego; but even more tempting to a gifted artist wanting to be lauded as a master, but slavishly bound to a workshop's and culture's orthodoxy.. Denial of style, of his identity, leads him to murder-- I can't help but thinking of that amazing scene where he tries but fails to draw an accurate self-portrait of himself, in the style of the Venetians. Now, I don't know if anyone actually has been incited to murder (I hope not) over miniaturist painting, or because they can't resolve the tensions between individualism and collectivism and east and west. (Most certainly they have due to the sparring between traditional and modern concepts). Of course, in real life a murderer driven by these motives would be ghastly indeed, but put it into a novel, intellectualize and make it literary, by having a character be so tormented by these discordant philosophies: it's really brilliant. The other intellectual murderer I thought of while reading this novel is Dostoyevsky's Rodion Raskolnikov from. Crime and Punishment. ; one of literature's greatest character studies. What I'm trying to say is I've realized I dig intellectual murderers at the center of a plot in novels, as a way to explore societal pressures, and as a character's futile attempt to remake or understand oneself. I wonder if these tormented literary murderers tend to be male characters, however. The murderesses I've read in literature tend to kill as an act of protest or desperation after a lifetime of degradation. So, if anyone knows of an intellectual woman murderer in literature--someone who commits murder because they are trying to understand their identity or test their personal philosophy-- do recommend!. Another thing I wanted to note about. My Name is Red. : I think it's helped me view painting in a different way. I happened to be visiting a lot of art museums during spring break while reading this book, and I found myself looking at paintings in a different way because of it. Crossing from adjacent rooms dedicated to the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th century European painting, I finally understood on a deeper level how revolutionary the theory of perspective was at that time. What more can you ask of literature? If it can change or enrich the way you observe or interpret things in the smallest way, or make you re-evaluate or better understand a concept, it has been successful. Also, I don't think I've ever seen Turkish miniature paintings in person, but now I'm super curious. According to Pamuk, Muslim artists were attempting to paint the world as God perceived it, not as humans did, and artistic perfection was the flawless imitation of old masters. It's a philosophy of art that I hadn't thought of before, but no less valid than the western tradition I'm familiar with.. This is a novel of ideas. With the exception of a few instances, Pamuk presents his themes in an adept way--not too overbearing. There's definitely a lot of things he raises in the novel that I want to chew over still. To paraphrase: is style merely imperfection, not individualism? Are all pictures only possible through memory, even if what you're drawing is in front of you? Does a painting achieve legendary status for its nature or what is said about it? Is beauty really just the eye discovering what the mind knows already?. Right now I'm rating this book four stars, partly because I struggled to stay engaged at a few points in the novel--in particular, I'm thinking of when Pamuk took us away from the plot and made us read nine parables in a row (""Alif,"" ""Ba"" and ""Djim"") and then told us how we should interpret these parables-- quite tiresome. Still, I suspect this book might come to have a special staying power for me, so don't be surprised if I eventually upgrade it to 5 stars.. Some quotes I liked:. ""I don't want to be a tree, I want to be its meaning."". ""Painting is the silence of thought and the music of sight."". ""A great painter does not content himself by affecting us with his masterpieces; ultimately, he succeeds in changing the landscape of our minds. Once a miniaturist's artistry enters our souls this way, it becomes the criterion for the beauty of our world."". ""But as with all lovers of color, he gets carried away with his emotions and is fickle."". ""It was Satan who first said 'I!' It was Satan who adopted a style. It was Satan who separated East from West."". ""I now understand that by furtively and gradually re-creating the same pictures for hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of artists had cunningly depicted the gradual transformation of their world into another."". ""Books, which we mistake for consolation, only add depth to our sorrow.""","Apr 23, 2017"
44046886,Nafees Ahmed,"Orhan Pamuk does a rare thing with 'My Name is Red' - he patiently weaves artistic philosophy to voice the cultural difference with a murder mystery to keep passive audience engage. Venetian painting - conferring the immortality to the humans through deftly painted self-portrait causes the ruckus among the miniaturists of Istanbul who believe in imitating the work of their masters without the scope of subjective interference. Eastern art is governed by the perspective of Allah and Western art is governed by the of humans. Eastern style doesn't give scope for artistic exploration. Any form of individualistic style or originality is considered as blasphemy. A secret project is commissioned by the Ottoman Sultan that borders in imitating the Western style and thus results in the mysterious death of one of the miniaturists. It's a breezy read but beware, the subtexts are complex and allegorical nested stories, recurring in Pamuk's novel, make the story layered and intellectually gratifying.","Feb 26, 2019"

Sometimes I used to feel overwhelmed by how dense the story was yet I was not considering putting it down. I decided to let myself enjoy this volume on my own pace. I was always picking it up with curiosity, interest and ready for a mind pleasure. Huge advantage of ""My Name Is Red"" is in my opinion the way it is structured. It is written considering different characters points of views. I was astonished how Pamuk could write a text from the perspective of a tree, gold coin, satan or death with the same artistry. It seems mind-blowing. The plot itself is not very complex. It is a story about love-obsession, art, skilled miniaturists who devotes their lives to illustrating books from the earliest years under the strong, demanding but also very affective eye of their master. It is also about death, life, ways of seeing, rebellion and revenge. It is about what could we give up for the things we believe in or love. The highest point of this book is definitely the way it was written. Masterpiece. I cannot wait to explore other creations by Orhan Pamuk.","Apr 14, 2019"

To be sure, the writing style was enjoyable and the discussions were elegant, but given the complexity of Pamuk's project, it's awfully hard to integrate as a whole.

263205,Matthew,"Someone or other once said that ""self-confidence is knowing what you can't do well, and avoiding it."" While that perspective sounds like a recipe for a fairly limited life, there's an element of truth to it -- particularly when it comes to writing.. There's a kind of writerly skill that almost never gets mentioned in book reviews, because it precedes anything that appears on the page. It's the process of choosing a plot and structure for the as-yet-nonexistent novel: part inspiration and part calculation, a kind of half-conscious gestation during which the writer chooses a quarry that matches their particular strengths and weaknesses. We can call this the. cunning. of the author, which consists of (to revisit the maxim above) knowing what you can't do well, and avoiding it -- or better yet, turning that shortcoming to your advantage.. My Name Is Red. is possibly the best example of ""writerly cunning"" I've ever encountered. Ostensibly, the plot is a kind of stylized murder-mystery: at the Ottoman court in Constantinople, a miniaturist (manuscript illuminator) is killed while working on an innovative, possibly blasphemous book, and everyone scrambles to find out whodunnit. Within this ""frame story"" however,. My Name Is Red. is something much more: narrated by something like seven primary characters (with voices from a few secondary characters, and even inanimate objects, chiming in), it's a debate about individuality vs. tradition, and the nature of selfhood.. According to Ottoman tradition, a miniaturist should not have a recognizable painting style, and should not even sign their own work: they should function as anonymous clerks, revealing God's creation. Contact between this tradition and Venetian (western European) painting, in which individual style was highly valued, inevitably led to upheaval within the Ottoman artistic world. Each of the characters in this novel is torn between the ""old way"" of doing things, in which the significance of individuals (both in art and in life) is minimized, and the tempting (but perhaps blasphemous) idea that individual style has value and should not be hidden. In a reductionist sort of way, we might call this a tug-of-war between group- and individual-based notions of identity.. All of this is interesting enough, but Pamuk's stroke of genius is this: he simply cannot (it seems) convincingly write from multiple distinct points of view.. Brilliant.. By writing a novel told by multiple characters, each of whom longs to have an individual style --. but all of whom sound exactly the same. -- Pamuk illustrates dramatically the pathos of these characters, and the cognitive distance between the worlds they hope to bridge. This is a feat of writerly cunning and ingenuity that left me, quite simply, in awe.. On the other hand, as a reader, much of. My Name Is Red. left me cold. The sameness of all the voices in the novel does begin to grow tedious after awhile, and the stories-within-a-story told by various characters felt like contrived digressions. This is more a writer's book than a reader's -- but as a work of authorial architecture, it is a masterpiece.","Jan 07, 2009"
4037122,Tarfah,"Let me preface this by saying that from the get-go I felt that this book was just not my style; the author's style was just too convoluted, and the prose too high-brow. Having said that, I took this book as a personal challenge which I just could not put away unfinished.. The intrigue surrounding the book commissioned by the Sultan around which the entire story was based, and the murders that occurred due to the book's supposedly blasphemous content, were, in my opinion, really just an excuse to go on and on about the history of Arab, Persian (generally Eastern) artistry (calligraphers, illustrators, illuminators, etc.). Lovers of art and history would most likely be enraptured by My Name is Red.. Also, the never-ending repetition of the Shirin and Husrev love story was truly irritating. When I first started this book, I had never heard of them. By the end of it, I didn't want to hear any more! Same goes with the tale of the Whitesheep and the Blacksheep. I kept on thinking ""not this again!"". I also did not like the heroine Shekure in the slightest: hated her manipulative and conniving nature, and thought she was a terrible role-model for her sons, who, as the whim struck her, and as they suited her convenience, she could be cuddling one minute, then cruelly slapping the next.. The highlight of the story for me was the chapter ""I am a gold coin"". For someone who doesn't enjoy overly descriptive novels, I thought the imagery and the reader's imagination were truly captured in telling the story of the coin- truly wonderful.. My favorite character was that of the Jewess, Esther, whose colorfulness and busy-body meddling were truly entertaining, and whose character was the most relatable.. In short, I truly felt this book could have been ALOT shorter than it was- basically the entire story surrounding the Sultan's book and the associated murders could have been told in under 200 pages were it not for the over descriptive nature of the author's writing style and his continuous re-telling of the same/similar tidbits of artistic history.. I can understand why readers would enjoy this book, but it definitely isn't my style.","Jul 21, 2010"
4356644,Hira,"It is seldom that one picks up a book that bypasses any and all genres, and comes alive in your hands and speaks to you. Such is the kind of book Orhan Pamuk has written. Part love story, part murder plot, part commentary on all things spiritual - it is a beautifully written book with a great many multi-faceted characters.. Pamuk uses various different characters to narrate his book - some of the chapters even narrated by unusual characters such as the murdered corpse of Elegant Effendi, ""Ink"", a ""Coin"", Satan, two dervishes and the color ""Red"". It is especially the voices of these characters that become emblazoned upon your soul.. The plot lies in the murder of Elegant Effendi, the reason for which is stated to be his working on an illustrated book commissioned by the Sultan. 'Black', who is in love with late Elegant's daughter Shekure, is striving hard to uncover the murderer and win widowed Shekure's hand in marriage. Also, we hear from his fellow artists/miniaturists ""Butterfly"", ""Stork"" and ""Olive"", with their views on the West influencing Eastern arts. Thus, Orhan Pamuk is able to masterfully entwine a mystery, a romance, and allegory to the clash of Eastern and Western culture all in one wonderful book.. In his book, Pamuk writes ""An artist should never succumb to hubris of any kind, he should simply paint the way he sees fit rather than troubling over East or West."" - and that is precisely how Pamuk offers his progressive perspective, richly Eastern in nature, but pleasantly influenced by Western ideologies as well. He creates an amalgamation of both cultures, in which the values of each one are preserved and respected, and does it quite successfully. Olive, one of the miniaturists, offers his perspective on art as, ""Through our colors, paints, art and love, we remember that Allah had commanded us to ""See""!"" - and that is what Orhan Pamuk so craftily presents in this book, a chance for the reader to see beyond cultures and races, similarities and differences and be completely enchanted by the mystical, lyrical and awe-inspiring realm that ""My Name is Red"" is, as a novel.","Sep 29, 2010"
5603048,Jeruen,"This is a complicated read. It took me a month to read this, which was somewhat unexpected. So, what is this book about?. My Name is Red is a story about a murder, set in 1600 in Istanbul. An illustrator is found murdered, and the book weaves a story where the reader is kept guessing as to the identity of the murderer. Along with it is woven a story of love and sex, and family relations in the Islamic world.. The book is written in a post-modern style, and after reading this, I understand why the author garnered a Nobel Prize for this book. Every chapter has a different narrator, so the story is told through various points of view. Even atypical narrators are utilized in this story, including a gold coin, a corpse, a picture of a horse, and so on. With that I am impressed with the creativity of the author.. However, it took me a long time before I grew to like this book. Several factors came into play, for this to be the case. First of all, I am not at all familiar with the cultural references that the book has with respect to Istanbul and the Islamic World in the Middle Ages. The fact that there are several narrators also made things complicated, since I had a little bit of difficulty keeping track of who was who in the stream of events. It was after I finished half of the book that I started liking this novel, when the possible murderers were narrowed down to three.. No matter how I do not like the story, however, praise should be given to the structure. This is not just a simple airport novel. This is literature. I had to make full use of my brain when I was reading this. This was no simple read, and it required me to analyze and exercise some critical thinking in order to understand this novel.. All in all, I believe this is a very mature novel. People who only want some swooning mystery or romance will not find this enjoyable. Only people who want something that stimulates the brain will find this a great read. If you're one of those people, then by all means pick this book up.","Jun 09, 2011"
56111743,Roman Clodia,"Firstly, despite the way Faber have decided to promote this book, it's not a murder mystery in the way those words are usually understood: so if you're looking for a thriller with clues, twists and turns, this definitely isn't it. Partly for that reason I think the reviews which compare it with Eco's The Name of the Rose are off-point. That was a book which playfully refers to the intertextual nature of all reading; reading isn't what's at stake in Pamuk's book at all.. Instead it is a profound and engaging meditation on the contrasting and sometimes conflicting views of eastern and western aesthetics of art, especially visual and religious art: or, rather, the religiosity of art.. Yes, there is a murder which kicks off the story, and another one mid-way through (very brutal and disturbing) but who did it really isn't either the point or the driver of this book. There's also a love story at its heart, but one which draws on the Persian epics that it constantly refers to and so half invites and half resists comparisons with western love stories.. Other reviewers on Amazon have complained about the narrative voices all sounding the same, and that is the case, but I assume because Pamuk isn't interested in writing a character-driver novel. Also don't read it if you're expecting a lush historical full of exotic detail as that's not the type of book it is.. In summary, this is an intellectually-accomplished and brave novel that deals with hard subjects. It's not a difficult read but it is a slow one, one that you need to take your time over and digest, not a page-turner where you can't wait to find out what happens next. I think it's an important book but it won't be to everyone's taste.","Jun 09, 2016"
4056626,Shreerag Plakazhi,"What is the meaning of art? Is it meant as entertainment, is it meant to please the masses or answer a higher calling? These are some of the questions that will be brought to you as you read this book. Answers, as any good philosopher knows is not important, but the questions are there for you to interpret as you choose. The questions are inevitable if you spend a lifetime reading books of this nature.. Reading My Name is Red was for me quite labourious. The prose style is something I haven't encountered before and I had to force myself to keep reading for at least the first 20% of the book. Once I got used to the varied points of view and the inherent unreliability of narrators, I started seeing the writing from a higher perspective. I was now the observer to this carefully carved universe of illuminators and calligraphers in Ottoman times. Pamuk does a great job of simulating what I like to call the Rashomon narrative - allowing us to be judges to multiple perspectives of a flowing story. The result is Nobel worthy.. The simplest explanation of plot for My Name is Red is that it is a murder mystery. The most complicated explanation for it is that it is so much more than just a simple murder mystery. Like many such books, the plot really is not very relevant to any discussion. It's just a means of exploring a world that feels like it has been created just for us. A world that exists just for us to make sense of the time period it was written about.. My Name is Red is an astounding piece of work. My biggest takeaway from the book is a renewed sense of belief in art and its importance in our lives. What greater gift can come from Turkey?","May 13, 2017"
335159,Ruth,"I'm not sure how to rate this book. On the one hand, Pamuk is an important writer and I should take advantage of what I can enjoy/learn from him. On the other hand, all the time I was reading I had to convince myself of this in order to keep marching on.. On the one hand, as an artist, I found the bits of information about the miniature arts and artists fascinating. On the other, would that they remained bits, instead of veering off toward treatises that interrupted the flow of the story.. On the one hand, it could have been a gripping murder mystery. On the other hand, it wasn’t. Part of the fun of a mystery is being able to guess at some of the possible solutions as you read. I was way, way, way too confused to guess.. On the one hand, it could have been an absorbing love story. On the other hand, it didn’t seem that either of the protagonists really gave a damn.. On the one hand, the multiple viewpoints thing worked brilliantly. On the other, it completely confused me in the beginning, and later I began to find it a tiresome gimmick that interrupted the flow with endless digressions.. On the one hand, I would have probably gotten more out of the book if I hadn’t skimmed in quite a few sections. On the other hand, I did skim or I’d still be bogged down in graceful if seemingly unending verbiage.. On the one hand, if I were rating on how important the book is I'd give it 4 stars. On the other, GR defines these stars as to how well one liked the book. Using that reasoning, I'll have to give it two.","Jun 04, 2008"
29209,Desiree Koh,"MP bet me $20 that I wouldn't like this book. The Brats were enthralled by this, because they can't remember the last time I whole-heartedly liked a book we read.. I liked and enjoyed the book, right until about page 350 (of 500) when I absolutely did not want to read any more about the philosophy of 16th century Islamic art nor flowery speeches about famous Turkish miniatures. Pamuk does himself a lot of injustice by making the book twice as long as it needs to be. I stopped caring and analyzing, which is a pity, because it's a very smart book that skilfully employs literary devices so proficiently it could teach a creative writing course. You could follow the carefully embedded clues to uncover the culprit of the murder that's central to the plot by detecting nuances in each character's narrative and his painting style. It's interesting to note that by the end of the book, Pamuk has placed himself as the true narrator, while challenging you to whole-heartedly believe what he has said. You realize that you've just examined a piece of literature a la CSI the way curators may a work of art.. If that work of art was a mosaic the size of the Great Wall of China. I’m giving MP $10.","Mar 28, 2008"
271946,Jaspreet,"I picked up My Name is Red by Orhan Pamuk to fulfill the November destination of the World Party Reading Challenge. It took me much longer than expected to finish the book. While the story was interesting, it is a murder mystery with many possible suspects, I found it hard to get through in the beginning. I was confused by the cast of characters, but I grew to enjoy the subplots as well as the main plot. Looking at paintings and artistic style to determine a murderer was very intriguing. I learned a lot about the connection between art and Islam.. The format of the book also drew me in as each chapter is told from a different perspective, including objects like coins and colors like red. The book one many awards and while I appreciated the story, I felt like I was not fully grasping all of the historical information. In spite of my slight feelings of inadequacy, I did appreciate the longing of the miniaturists to protect a practice which they had spent their whole lives perfecting.. For me, the character of Shekure best represented the tension between the modern and traditional world. She navigates societal norms and expectations in order to secure a place for herself and her children. It is impressive that she manages to create a life with one of the men she loves.","Apr 01, 2011"
15236138,Reem Ghabbany,Where should I start with this amazing book! I bought this book while I was on vacation in Istanbul last March.. This is literally a master piece! An absolutely well written book.. I don't think I've read a book this complicated and this detailed.. I never guessed who the killer was until the very end when it was super obvious.. Okay let me tell you a bit about this book.. It a story from 400 years ago. Based in Istanbul. About a group of miniaturists who devoted their lives to painting. They breathed art and because of their obsession with art it drove them to commit foul murderers.. There's also a beautiful love a story and talks about Islam.. I gave this book 5 starts because it definitely deserves 5 stars! If there were 10 starts I'd give it to that book cause I never read a book like this before so well depicted and beautifully written.. Although this was a hard read for me cause it's different from what I usually read and to be honest I think only someone who's very smart would enjoy this book which is why I didn't enjoy so much cause I didn't understand a lot of the things in it lol.,"Mar 17, 2016"

I did like it, despite the length, despite all those details referring to names of shahs, miniaturists and all kind of Persian and Turkish art references I wasn't familiar with. Speaking of that, the (excellent) Romanian edition has a very useful glossary at the end of the book, plus the footnotes (did I ever mention I'm a sucker for footnotes?).. The story is quite captivating and it has a little bit of everything - romance, murder, mystery, good VS evil, old/traditional VS new and a huge amount of info about Ottoman culture, art and lifestyle. And, another interesting thing, each chapter is told from a different perspective, whether it's one of the characters or a detail from the miniatures (a tree, a dog or a colour)..

35112891,Naddy,"Plot : At once a fiendishly devious mystery, a beguiling love story, and a brilliant symposium on the power of art, My Name Is Red is a transporting tale set amid the splendor and religious intrigue of sixteenth-century Istanbul, from one of the most prominent contemporary Turkish writers.. The Sultan has commissioned a cadre of the most acclaimed artists in the land to create a great book celebrating the glories of his realm. Their task: to illuminate the work in the European style. But because figurative art can be deemed an affront to Islam, this commission is a dangerous proposition indeed. The ruling elite therefore mustn’t know the full scope or nature of the project, and panic erupts when one of the chosen miniaturists disappears. The only clue to the mystery–or crime? –lies in the half-finished illuminations themselves. Part fantasy and part philosophical puzzle, My Name is Red is a kaleidoscopic journey to the intersection of art, religion, love, sex and power.. I think Historical fiction is new genre which i am devouring off-late, My Name is Red is part thriller, part romance and part philosophical. It opens with Ottoman Sultan commissioning the making of illustrated book rendered in Venetian style to be presented as a gift to Dodge. A miniaturist called Elegant is so appalled by the blasphemy of this realistic depiction that another miniaturist kills him out of fear that he will incite the wrath of the ones who follows the stricter version of Islam against all miniaturists.. To sumarise, My Name is Red is a philosophical thriller constructed around the clash between these two views of artistic meaning, which is also a chasm between two world civilisations.. The writing is something very unique, each page starts with I am then character name, I really liked the way it has been written. Orhan is my new favourite. To me this profound book with deep roots.. “I hear the question upon your lips: What is it to be a colour?. Colour is the touch of the eye, music to the deaf, a word out of the darkness. Because I’ve listened to souls whispering – like the susurrus of the wind – from book to book and object to object for tens or thousands of years, allow me to say that my touch resembles the touch of angels. Part of me, the serious half, calls out to your vision while the mirthful half sours through the air with your glances.. I’m so fortunate to be red! I’m fiery. I’m strong. I know men take notice of me and that I cannot be resisted.. I do not conceal myself: For me, delicacy manifests itself neither in weakness nor in subtlety, but through determination and will. So, I draw attention to myself. I’m not afraid of other colours, shadows, crowds or even of loneliness. How wonderful it is to cover a surface that awaits me with my own victorious being! Wherever I’m spread, I see eyes shine, passions increase, eyebrows rise and heartbeats quicken. Behold how wonderful it is to live! Behold how wonderful to see. I am everywhere. Life begins with and returns to me. Have faith in what I tell you.”","Jul 20, 2020"
2634423,TheGirlBytheSeaofCortez,"Orhan Pamuk’s exquisite novel,. My Name is Red. , is set in Istanbul in the late 16th century, during the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. Sultan Murat III, however, stubbornly refuses to face reality and persists in believing the Empire is at its zenith, instead. Wanting to celebrate a thousand years of Islam, he listens attentively to one of his miniaturists who has just returned from a trip to Venice, both impressed and obsessed with the ""new"" style of painting he observed there.. The Sultan is a man concerned with making an impression, and he commissions a book, a very special and secret book, that, when complete, will be sent to the Doge, in Venice. Breaking with tradition, the Sultan orders Enishte Effendi to gather together four celebrated miniaturists to decorate a book in the Frankish, or Venetian, style of painting, complete with perspective and portraiture, something not found in Eastern painting.. Miniaturists depicted scenes of battle, scenes of everyday life, scenes of love and more, in a rigidly prescribed manner. The leaf of a tree, or a blade of grass, was given as much importance as was the face of a person. And when persons were depicted, they were never representational; a man could be any man, a woman, any woman. Perspective remained always the same, and the miniaturists painted as if they were viewing the scene from the vantage point of Allah.. The Frankish style of painting, because it glorifies the individual, goes against strict Islamic dogma and is considered an insult to Allah, himself. Thus, the miniaturists selected to work on the new book must work in the strictest of secrecy, and not all of them agree that the Frankish style of painting is the path an artist should pursue. It isn’t long before one of the miniaturists, Elegant Effendi, a master gilder, is found dead. Indeed, he is already dead when the book opens, but Pamuk, who is an innovative author, allows Elegant to speak to us from the grave.. There are three miniaturists left working on the book, and one of them, Enishte believes, has to be Elegant’s murderer.. In an effort to solve Elegant’s murder, Enishte recalls his nephew, Black, a civil servant who has spent the last twelve years working in ""the provinces,"" to Istanbul. Black’s mission is really twofold: he wants to solve Elegant’s murder, and on a more personal level, he wants to win the heart of Shekure, Enishte’s beautiful daughter, something he failed to do twelve years previously. But, before he can solve Elegant’s murder, yet another murder occurs, this one hitting far closer to home.. So, is. My Name is Red. a murder mystery or is it a love story? Well, it’s a little of both, and yet, it’s also neither. I do think the voices of Shekure and Black are the book’s most compelling and the characters with whom the reader feels the most empathy. As a Moslem woman, Shekure is confined to her home with only her sons, Orhan and Shevket, for company. Her efforts at letting Black know she’s open to his advances are expedited by Esther, a Jewish seller of fabric and an inveterate matchmaker. Esther is, I think, one of the most colorful characters in the book and she certainly adds a bit of comic relief.. My Name is Red. is told in fifty-nine short chapters and from the viewpoint of about a dozen of the book’s characters, including Black, Shekure, a sketch of a horse, a counterfeit gold coin, a tree, the corpse of the murdered Elegant, a dog, the color red, Satan and the three remaining miniaturists: Olive, Stork and Butterfly. Although one might think that a book containing so many point of view characters would be ""choppy,"" this isn’t the case with. My Name is Red. . It. is. difficult to get involved with the characters, however. We know their thoughts, true, but many of them are unreliable narrators, and as the persistent reader will discover at the book’s end, Pamuk has been playing a little literary game with us. All is definitely not what it seems.. Although. My Name is Red. is not, in any way, choppy, Pamuk really doesn’t give his characters, other than possibly Black, Shekure and Master Osman, distinct voices. The three remaining miniaturists all sound exactly the same. With the exception of one concluding chapter, the reader could switch their names around at will and it wouldn’t make the slightest difference. This makes it very difficult to care who killed Elegant and why. Truthfully, I didn’t care who it was. I didn’t want it to be Butterfly, simply because I liked his name the best, and that’s really not a very good reason.. My Name is Red. is a very densely plotted, convoluted book, chock full of detail. Many people have compared it to Umberto Eco glorious. The Name of the Rose. , and it’s quite obvious that Pamuk used the latter book as his inspiration. Both books contain seemingly unsolvable murders, both involve interaction between intellectuals and the community to which they belong, both involve social commentary and both are, as I mentioned above, very densely plotted.. The Name of the Rose. , is, I think, more atmospheric and, in addition, it’s a roman-a-clef, something. My Name is Red. is not.. My Name is Red. is, of course, neither plot nor character driven, but thematically based. It’s a meditation on East-meets-West (which makes it highly fitting that it’s set in Istanbul, since that’s the only city in the world that geographically, straddles two continents...Europe and Asia), art, and the age-long tendency of Islam to simply self-destruct. To Pamuk’s credit, he never slips into polemic. He tells his story and lets his readers draw their own conclusions.. While some sections, in particular, the sections narrated by the three murder suspects, can be quite dry, for the most part. My Name is Red. is beautifully written. The book contains some beautiful and unforgettable set pieces. The set piece in which Master Osman blinds himself rather than paint in the Western style is unforgettable, and the set piece detailing the book’s second murder, during which red ink and crimson blood mingle and become one, is exquisitely written and really, not at all gruesome.. Although Pamuk never gives us a clue as to which type of art he, himself prefers, Black, his creation, does say this:. Everybody secretly desires to have a style. Everybody also deserves to have his portrait made, just as Our Sultan did. Is this affliction impossible to resist? As this plague spreads, none of us will be able to stand against the methods of the Europeans. .. That, I think, remains to be seen.","Aug 19, 2009"
58543750,Aditi Chikhale,"Amidst the lockdown during coronavirus, I had run out of physical books to read. My sister’s friend came to the rescue and brought over a few from her collection. That is how I came to read. My Name is Red. , a book I didn’t know anything about. The blurb seemed very interesting and I started with this book set in 16th century Istanbul.. Elegant Effendi is murdered. The book opens with his corpse informing us about how he was murdered brutally over a dispute regarding a secret book. A secret book commissioned by the Sultan and managed by Enishte Effendi. He is responsible for the illustrations in the book and he has hired three miniaturists for this highly secretive and important job. Elegant Effendi is the gilder, a person who makes the borders of a page with gold, for this book. When he is murdered, the completion of this special book is in turmoil and it becomes essential to catch the killer.. Sounds interesting right? Well, it is but it was not really my cup of tea. You have to have a lot of patience to get through this book. The book is narrated from different perspectives and the reader is often included in the narrative, breaking the fourth wall. It is amusing. The plot is great, at its centre a clash of philosophies, and many short fables defending one point of view or another. The book speaks a lot about style and individuality and the way it is narrated emphasizes these points. It’s like looking at a kaleidoscope through a kaleidoscope, a meta-reading experience. There is no doubt that Orhan Pamuk is gifted to have written such a book. I can see that it is a work of genius but I didn’t like it much. The book stayed by my bedside for four weeks, wishing I could finish it quickly but not being able to read more than a few pages at a time.","Jun 10, 2020"
69332753,Jared Gibson,"An intellectually stimulating and entertaining murder mystery, My Name is Red presented me with something I have never encountered before: the philosophy behind medieval art. Not only is it a murder mystery and a love story, but it discusses the motivation behind the two styles of painting at the time: the European style and the Ottoman style. Set in Istanbul, most of the characters adhere to the Ottoman style and its philosophy lest they be labeled infidels for painting like the Europeans do. However, this does not prevent them from discussing why the Frankish style (or even both styles) are blasphemous. The result is a philosophical conversation that delves into nearly every aspect of painting, including “style.”. If you are not one for a debate on medieval art, you can still appreciate the components of the book that are more to entertaining. The narrator changes from chapter to chapter, and the reader sees the world as if in the mind of one of the characters of the novel. Although some may find this chaotic, Pamuk does a great job at jumping from narrator to narrator while preserving the coherence of the story. In this way, it is almost like relay race. Each character carries the baton as far as they can and when they can run no further, they hand it off to the next character. Although you may prefer not to think about it, this provides another layer to the philosophical discussion about “perspective.”","Jun 05, 2019"

181878,Natalie,"Complicated review.. I loved a lot of this book. The opening chapter was amazing. I loved the combination of love story and murder mystery and art history. I loved the rotating narrators, which could be a cute, cheap trick with some authors, but which Pamuk pulls off in the best way possible. I loved how the different narrators addressed the reader directly, and how that lent an element of distrust to the whole thing. My favorite narrators were Shekure, Esther, and the murderer. Shekure's character was fascinating--I loved watching her wring power out of her miserable, limited circumstances, her ingenuity in tenaciously pursuing her family's interests while awash in the sea of misogyny and violence. I loved how aware Esther was of all of Shekure's ploys (like when she sits crying in Hasan's house so that she doesn't have to make a decision about where to go, while making sure all the pieces are in place so that the outcome she wants will come about without her being held accountable for it). That was probably my favorite part of this book--seeing how two women worked together creatively to have as much autonomy and power in this society as possible.. And I loved what I thought. at first. was a tongue-in-cheek mockery of pretentious, highfalutin artists and philosophers. All the artist characters make absurd comparisons between things like drawing a horse and murdering a person. They go on ridiculous, loquacious tangents about art, and different art patterns, and how manuscript illumination was the real motivation behind all major historical events, and how it revealed so much about life, yadda yadda yadda. And they are arrogant, greedy, self-important, and patently ridiculous. I actively enjoyed every page; I couldn't get enough of Pamuk's words and characters.. But somewhere in the last third of the book, I felt like that mocking tone disappeared. (Or maybe I just misread the earlier parts?) It was no longer about laughing at the characters bloated sense of their own significance, and enjoying seeing how silly their narcissism and art-obsession made them. Without that tone, the pages and pages and pages about art styles and history and what-not became a bit of a drag. It started to read like an old Russian novel, with too much extended dinner-table philosophy. (Don't get me wrong, I love old Russian novels, but that style just wasn't working in this context.) After so much of the first half of the novel was written with really engaging dialogue and very down-to-earth narration, the more sedated narration towards the end just blew the momentum to pieces. The self-aware feeling of the narrative was the best part of the book to begin with, and I definitely enjoyed it less when it diminished.. I am in general not very into super philosophical approaches to art, and wordy treatises about how art reveals the depth of the human soul blah blah blah. That's why I enjoyed the portrayal of the artists as people who had all this narcissistic pretension about the importance of their work, while also just being self-serving assholes. (It was interesting, however, to juxtapose them against Master Osman, whose perspectives on art seemed a lot more important and real and meaningful.) So when the loooong paragraphs about art ceased to feel mocking, they mostly just became boring.. Also, Pamuk could have taken out fully 50% of the references to ""pretty young boys"" and still have gotten the point across perfectly. It came up so frequently that if just felt like he was trying to hit you over the head with it. I get it. Miniaturist society included a helluva lot of child molestation. It doesn't have to be mentioned every 5 pages.. Reading this made me remember that in the other Pamuk book I've read,. Snow. , color seemed to be important but unexplained--a notable character was named Blue, for example. It makes me want to research the symbolism of different colors in Turkish culture, because I feel like there might be another layer of meaning there that I'm missing.. Overall, 4 stars, because I reeeeally enjoyed a lot of this, and the bulk of it was just pure brilliance. I was bummed that parts of it ended up disappointing me.","Dec 10, 2013"
16737952,Jelena,"Although there is the challenge to unmask a murderer, „My Name is Red” is about as much a murder story as “The Brothers Karamazov”. It is also no mere love story and not just a historical novel. Not a theological dispute. More than an essay on art and even more than a question of identity, of the universal and individual. It is all of the above.. Naming the plot of this novel is very difficult, since ‒ apart from the protagonist trying to solve a murder case, to get the illustrations for a secret book finished and to win over the love of his life ‒ there are the personal stories of all the supporting characters and their connections and relationships, as well as contributions to several theoretical problems.. I was very intrigued by the sense that this is not a novel of action with a layer of contemplation underneath, but that the reader is much more focused on the discussion than on the actual ongoing in the fictional world. Or to speak just for myself: I cared much more for the metaphysics than about who did it and whether the hero gets the girl (somewhat like in “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” and again the “Karamazovs”).. Perspective and style are the origin of everything contained in this account. Taking place in the Ottoman Empire of the late 16th century and featuring a guild of master illustrators and everyone in connection with them, the basic question raised is whether to stick to the old, traditional ways by all means or to be open to something different allowing it maybe to change what one is accustomed to. But there is no need to have any kind of background in art history (or religion, for it gets close) for this one. It suffices to follow the question of what makes us what we are and if it is natural to wish for some unique feature that would distinguish an individual from the group or if modesty is the one virtue most difficultly achieved. There is also the question of whether what one sees is always what there is. If a thing changes with perspective, can a momentary view in all of its accuracy be of greater value than the steady and universal idea of the same thing? And even though it is never explicitly political, there is the lingering question of Go East vs. Go West, quite modern given the circumstances, but also a very good historical setting.. The structure of this novel alone is so fascinating that it contributes very much to the overall impression. There are about a dozen narrators, all characters in the novel, but of different age, gender, origin, social status etc, and about equally many that are neither alive nor human nor do they exist for that matter. We never hear the same story twice, for every narrator continues where the previous one had stopped or shows us scenes where the other characters are not present. The whole picture is put together piece by piece, like a puzzle. It is so perfectly orchestrated that you can feel someone pulling the strings and presenting a show. And there are always those fantasy narrators showing you how they know that you know about the conductor in the shadow, speaking directly to the reader (I have a thing for methods like that) etc.. And in case you do care about playing detective, look for some personal features that will reveal the murderer soon enough. This is a matter of style after all.","Mar 14, 2013"
12433059,Samuel,"I really wanted to like this book as much as other reviewers. It was not easy getting into Pamuk’s tale because of how much it reminded me, on the surface at least, of Eco’s. The Name of the Rose. (the title perhaps subtly recalls this debt, but most professional reviewers prefer to ignore the obvious and point out Pamuk’s indebtedness to Borges).. My Name is Red. weaves the clash of eastern and western culture, between Islam and modernity, into a tapestry of 16th century Istanbul when it was a superpower. The Turkish school of illuminators struggles with the influence of renaissance European portraiture then aflourish with individualism and perspective. Part of the irony of this depiction of the “anxiety of influence” is the degree to which the Turkish miniature school itself was influenced by Persian miniaturists, who in turn were influenced by Mongolian and Chinese artists, and going back even further, by Byzantine Christian miniaturists. The title presumably also alludes to the European word “miniature” which comes from the red lead paint border around a small painting to illustrate a text; only later did it come to mean small in size. Pamuk’s approach, creating verbal miniatures himself—the narrative of a dead man, a dog, a gold coin, a horse, two dervishes, the color red, the unidentified murderer, along with the major characters—is delightful, and I loved this creative use of the unreliable narrator. Passages of the book are quite beautiful, but unfortunately most of his characters, except Shekure and the city Istanbul itself, are weakly drawn. The perspectivism of this device pretty clearly shows which side Pamuk is on, even if some characters make a strong case for traditional representation consistent with a conservative interpretation of Islam. But the story devolves into too many repetitively similar philosophical and allegorical discussions of style for my taste (and I love art and philosophy). And as a murder mystery, the book disobeys the basic rule of allowing reasonably attentive readers to figure out the murderer at least by the time you nab him, instead preferring to give misleading clues presumably for the sake of surprise right up to the end. But instead of surprise, the ending just seems contrived. Or perhaps it ironically proves the fundamentalists’ point—that perspectivism destroys one’s ability to find the truth and lets one get away with murder? A rereading might show that I was not attentive enough or just don’t know enough about Turkish culture or certain aspects of Islamic religion to get the clues, but I’m not sure the book, despite its several beauties, will get that rereading. If you are going to read the book, you may be interested in this web site with discussions by art historians that includes some great examples of miniaturist art:. http://www.learner.org/courses/worldl.... or should at least consult a collection of images of Turkish and Persian miniatures, as that time will be better spent. For a different perspective, John Updike gives the book a much more positive review:. http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2001...","Dec 22, 2012"
55749466,Jaimita,"I met a Turkish girl on a plane. We clicked and there ensued an enthralling two-hour conversation on culture, spirituality and religion in Istanbul, India and New York. Fuelled by the curiosity to know more about the Turkish culture, I asked her for a book that might be worth reading. And that is how I got introduced to Orhan Pamuk. Not really knowing what I am getting into, I picked up 'My Name is Red'.. My Name is Red is a colourful infusion of mystery, religion and romance - all set in the times of Pashas and Sultans and miniaturists, when the magnificent and rich cities were Samarkand and Bukhara, the popular ruler was Tamerlane and the great master of Herat was Bihzad and the most romantic tale was Firdausi and Nizami's Husrev and Shirin.. Orhan writes every chapter with a new lens. 'I am Black', 'My Name is Shekure' - with names like this for each chapter, the story shifts perspective among Shekure, Black, Esther, a corpse, a dog, a tree, olive, butterfly, stork and more. I loved reading the perspectives of Shekure and Esther because they presented the emotional lens of women otherwise stifled with a largely male presence.. A miniature is killed, another one is killed, there are three suspects and there is commotion.. And there are stories boxed within this main story. To justify and prove and sometimes to just intellectualise, characters dive into parables of their magnificent kings, of the cities that were, of the lovers that were, of the supreme masters that were, of the pure religion and devotion that was and how painting was now getting degraded by the individualistic style of 'Franks' and 'Venetians'.. Painting for the old masters (old masters originated from Persia, the supreme master Bihzad of Herat was from Persia) was a means to become closer to god, to paint to catch a glimpse of how god perceives the world to be, to try and depict the reality was a heresy (a painting can never be the reality but only a depiction) and a thing of ""Franks"" and ""Venetians"". And that is mostly the dilemma that every character goes through. They see that their own culture is on the downward trend, they know that the portraiture which 'Franks' and 'Venetians' are doing, is the next coming thing. Should they earn good money by imitating the styles of Franks at the cost of losing self-respect and committing 'heresy'? Or as some characters ponder deeply upon whether it really is a heresy?. It is hard for me to rate this book. Because it is not just a book, it has been an experience!. And personally for me, I was blown away when amidst reading all of this, I found the immense cultural exchange between Persia and India. Persian poets and artists trickled down to India under Timurid and Mughal dynasties. Amir Khusro - a beloved and well known Sufi poet in India, has Persian descent and called himself Indo-Turk. The ghazals and qawallis which I listen to every day originated from Sufism founded by Rumi - a Persian poet/Sufi/mystic again! How wonderful it is to know that I, an Indian, am a product of the conglomeration of so many cultures. We have really soaked up every thing that came our way and in the best way possible. Cheers!","Nov 25, 2018"
2327087,Neha,"I have only good things to say about this book. The most unique style of writing, with the story told by multiple narrators in sets. From people to animals, from living to nonliving, from real to symbolic characters - the story develops so many dimensions and point of views, that it nourishes and intrigues you as a reader. The narrators vary from the main characters Black, Esther, Shekure, Butterfly, Stroke, Olive, Orhan, Master Osman, to a corpse, a random Dog, color Red, a painted Horse, the unknown Murderer, to Satan, or just a Woman. Most books have either a protagonist or a third party unbiased narrator of events, but here you have more narrators than characters in the book. The story flows smoothly with each narration, giving others point of view to the same events but without forcing you to take sides or form opinions.. It's a culturally rich book explaining the complex and extinct art of Miniature painting, Royal patrons, religious connotations and conditions, aspiring artists, politics of the workshop and the underlying competition and jealousy. Pamuk's writing takes you straight to the streets of ancient Istanbul and you can visualize the story unfolding in front of your eyes. You are there, when the murder happens, when the murderer is running, when others are being questioned, when people are talking, at the secret wedding, when the masterpieces are being created. But you still can't figure who the murderer is? Pamuk holds your curiosity till the last page.. The book was deep and complex based in an unfamiliar age, genre and setting. Every time I got back to the book I had to choose a silent corner and read at least three to four pages, before its soft sensation warmed my palette. It was like drinking the warm Qahwah (Kashmiri Tea), it had to be warm and steaming to have the soothing effect you wanted. The book too can't be read in a hurry or even warmer.. Hence, a marvelous book.. mystifying and demystifying the ancient world of Miniature art, politics, crime and religion. Some beautiful lines from the book as a food for thought. Each word tells a story.. Read more on. Storywala","Sep 16, 2013"
33592940,Anirban Nanda,"A few observations:. 1. A meditation on the religious, artistic and philosophical conflicts between the East and the West. Whereas East encourages to find happiness amid harmony, West encourages to establish individual identities('style' or 'voice' in other words). Interestingly, for all the 51 chapters of this book, there are separate first person narratives corresponding to different characters. This not only gives the events and views many different perspectives, but also contributes to a completeness of analysis. In other words, by combining so many different voices the book emerges with a singular, harmonious voice, giving a sense of unity or general aspects common to both the worlds; a target the book set out to achieve.. 2. Frequent allusions to legendary artworks during A.D. 1500 give us an idea of that time, their culture and above all their sense of artistry. Cleverly, Pamuk weaves the history intricately and naturally, never allowing it to overshadow the emotional dynamics of the story.. 3. This is a book that focuses on the relation between East and West in a time when Illumination and Illustrative work was at its peak. Hence, it is understandable and quite apt to write book that follows the tradition and essence of a Miniature work. Like an extravagantly detailed work of a master miniaturist, this book is very intricate, detailed, such that you would find a story at any corner.. 4. The easy existence of homosexuality, the natural depiction of sex make it an excellent example of a book that treats sexuality as a book should.. 5. Also, the narrators directly interact with the reader, sometimes creating a diversion, sometimes telling a lie and later confessing (and even apologizing) evoke the old tradition of story-telling (as depicted in the book in coffeehouse) and thereby giving it a quality that every book aspires to have: to be able to become a friend of the reader.","Feb 01, 2017"
4922926,Elise,"I thoroughly enjoyed escaping to mysterious and enchanting 16th century Istanbul in this beautifully written and intelligent murder mystery, love story, adventure tale, and so much more. While this story was told from several characters' perspectives, the format did not take away from its pace, suspense, or appeal. Pamuk is a master at moving the story along and losing nothing but gaining a great deal through the multiple perspectives which were, as one critic described this story's telling, ""kaleidoscopic."" I can't think of a more fitting word for the way Pamuk brings this colorful, richly textured and remote world to life for his readers. However, I will admit that the plot did drag at times when Pamuk was explaining the intricacies (through his character, Master Osman, for example) of miniaturist art and its intersection with Islamic religion, culture, and aesthetics during this period in history, but I enjoyed this too because not only was I emotionally invested in Pamuk's characters and their plights, but I also learned so much. This book is at once a puzzle (which will have you flipping back to previous chapters for clues about each character's painting ""style"" to bring you closer to figuring out who the murderer is) and a page turner, although not a fast read. I don't recommend ""My Name is Red"" for readers looking for a light read. This novel is for intellectually curious readers, thinking people who enjoy being transported and transformed by the books they read.","Jun 22, 2013"
4012900,Azhar,"This is easily my favorite novel this year.. It isn't the first one I've read where each chapter unfolds from the perspective of a different character. But the diversity of perspectives was charming. You see the world as a murdered man, a love-struck Romeo, a murderer, a master artist, a gold coin, the picture of a tree, the color red - life and the afterlife, living and the inanimate, all traditional barriers to storytelling are mashed up in this liberating narrative experience.. Diversity of perspectives is also central to the plot, as it depicts the deep rooted conflict between classical Middle Eastern miniature art and the rise of European art styles. Indeed, the dividing line is so sharp that it leads to murder - and the delightful part is, throughout the novel you know that one of three possible characters are the murderers, and then you go through a number of chapters from the eye of the murderer, yet the author withholds enough information in those chapters so you don't discover till the very end who the murderer is.. Love, too, is a central element in the play, as the unwavering force of Black's love a la Mejnun duels with the volatility of Shekure's affections, torn between her dead husband, an unstable brother-in-law and the hopelessly infatuated protagonist.. It is not an easy read, especially for those of us unacquainted to medieval artistic movements, yet this is what makes it worth coming back to contemplating upon.. Looking forward to more works of this delightful craftsman.","Nov 26, 2014"
231580,Isabelle,"This is a very smart novel: set at the critical time where Western Renaissance art has started to infiltrate and threaten the traditional miniature art of Turkey, the book is at times a mystery, at times a memoir on art, at times a love story, and very often a running commentary on Turkey. I am sure that I do not know enough about Turkey, past and present, its history, its politics and its art to fully understand the depth of the book. It was a challenging book, and I did find myself re-reading certain passages to make sure I was getting most of the nuances. I also liked the construction of the book: small chapters, each narrated by one of the characters, often going over the same event from a different point of view. Needless to say, I was not able to solve the crime, or should I say the murder, as there are many crimes committed throughout the book, most of them moral, artistic, mystical and religious. There was a whole sequence taking place in the sultan's treasury that I found disturbing and almost scary in a fanatical sort of way.. I was so thrown off by the book and challenged by Pamuk's thinking that I cannot wait to read another of his books. I do think I will pick a more contemporary setting as it might be easier to bridge the cultural gap.","Oct 02, 2007"
55523193,Mila,"“To God belongs the East and the West. May he protect us from the will of the pure and unadulterated.”. Set in 16th Century Ottoman Empire, “My Name is Red” is concerned with the conflict between eastern tradition and westernization. This conflict is expressed through a series of murders around a mysterious book which subverts the codes of the pictorial art of miniature by introducing western techniques and therefore challenging an undefiled conception of islamic religion.. If the questions raised by the books find a strong echo in our 21th Century world, it seems logical to see them penned by a Turkish author, Turkey being the gateway between East and West and a country divided between its progressive inheritance and the weight of fundamentalist Islam.. Pamuk shares with Eco the ability to write a book with best-seller potential that is yet demanding and sophisticated. My Name is Red is simultaneously a gripping murder mystery, a historical novel, a thoughtful meditation on art and a playful modernist novel interweaving different narrators, calling out to its reader.. “Open your eyes, discover why the enemies of the life in which you believe, of the life you’re leaving, and of Islam, have destroyed me.”","Feb 10, 2017"
4999879,LindaJ^,"Red is the color of blood and quite a bit of it was spilled in this literary thriller. But, for me, Red was the name of a color used by the miniaturists in their drawings, and an interesting color it was. This book is a thriller, starting with a murder. But while it had sufficient action related to the thriller plot line, it also felt like a dissertation on Eastern art and how, at the time where the story takes place - the late 16th century - how Western art was starting to influence Eastern art. The style was unusual - no two adjacent chapters had the same narrator and sometimes the narrator was an animal or an inanimate object.. What made it drag for me was the repeated discussion of Eastern art and its masters. I did not know the historical figures and books being referenced, so found that hard to relate to. And I wasn't motivated, as I sometimes am when I encounter new-to-me history, to do any research. (If it had been ceramics and the painting style used, I might well have spent sometime doing homework.) Also, the characters, especially the younger ones, were mostly caricatures. I wouldn't have wanted any of them as friends.","Nov 09, 2016"
2006699,Tariq Mahmood,"Orhan is a master story teller.. 'Does love make one a fool or do only fools fall in love?' His prose read like poetry. I was taken on a mythical journey to a world where calligraphers and miniaturists reigned supreme. A world where every artist dreams of becoming a master. Where every master secretly dreams of rivalling God, the ultimate creator master of all. And where blindness achieved through hard work and dedication is a natural outcome of hard work and dedication. This book is an absolute must if you want to really understand the object of Islamic art of the Ottoman, Safavid and Moghul (Indian) eras. Why are idols derided in Islam? What can love teach us? Why is there so much focus on beauty in symmetry?. The story reads like a modern crime thriller, complete with a righteous serial killer and lovely independent women whose fate are intertwined with the frantic guild of the artistic ethos of the time. This makes the novel extremely easy to read.. Time doesn't flow if you don't dream.","Sep 17, 2013"

The mystery was intriguing and was what kept me reading, I certainly did not work our who done it. The love story was not that interesting and I did not like Shekure, she was very manipulative and did not seem to know what she wanted. It read like a art history book a lot of the time and although interesting to start with, I soon tired of it, if felt like this book could have been a lot shorter. It would have been great if this book had some illustrations to help with the descriptions of the pictures, but then I guess that would have made it even longer!!","Mar 08, 2012"

The love story was better I suppose, but Shekure is deliberately written 'not quite as she was', so I can't believe in her either.. My stars are for the trip into book-art. Ottoman art cast its eyes back and to the east, to the 'masters of Herat' and the great illuminated manuscripts of the Persian Book of Kings. We have tales from the 13th-15th centuries when Turks and Mongols roiled and book-arts flourished: I read on for these. Any novel that mentions Mehmet Black Pen, painter of demons and the everyday (from Turkestan, 15thC) needs stars..

27606335,Horia Bura,"Pamuk is a very good writer and the Nobel Prize won was one worth it, there's no doubt here. I think the most relevant element one could notice when reading this novel is the author's perfect ability of mastering phrasing, that unique way of choosing the right words in the right places (a thing that I could also say about Julian Barnes' writing). Moreover, this Turkish author is a complete artisan of building his novel, giving much attention to its structure, characters and narrative line. In my opinion, ""My Name is Red"" brings into question the eternal disjunction between old vs. new, sacred vs. profane, stability vs. change, inflexibility vs. adaptation. Although it took me a while to finish it and I had some bottlenecks in reading, I must admit that the world of miniaturists as described here is kind of fascinating and the parts about God, art, style etc are some of the best I have ever read in a work of fiction.","Feb 03, 2014"

But if that was all there was to this book my enjoyment would be severely limited. Instead there is more including a story of an oriental mystery: In Istanbul, in the late 1590s, the Sultan secretly commissions a great book: a celebration of his life and his empire, to be illuminated by the best artists of the day - in the European manner. But when one of the miniaturists goes missing and is feared murdered, their master seeks outside help. There is also embedded within the miniaturists and their stories and digressions the wonder of literature itself, of the nature of books and of their impact on life, culture and history. This makes for a great book that I would recommend to all.","Jan 15, 2009"

I realised it was more philosophical in nature, exploring art and its place in Islam and the nature of love and all that. I knew what I was going to read and I enjoyed what I was reading but it just wasn't enjoyable enough.. My rule of thumb is, if a book cannot keep my attention away from other books in my ""to-read"" pile, then it's not worth the time to finish it.. My Name Is Red. is such a book.

In the Faulknerian (Faulkner-esque?) tradition, it paints a narrative in layers, with each chapter an account from the point of view of a different character. Everyone has a voice, from incorrigible gossips and forlorn lovers to a painting of a tree and death itself.. Here's a gem from Pamuk:. ""A city's intellect ought to be measured not by its scholars, libraries, miniaturists, calligraphers and schools but by the number of crimes insidiously committed on its dark streets over thousands of years. By this logic, doubtless, Istanbul is the world's most intelligent city.""","Aug 01, 2007"

This book, in contrast, really drew me in, though I suspect I didn't fully appreciate its subtleties. Pamuk seems to be making a point about closed societies and taboos here, and there's ostensibly a murder mystery at the center of the tale, which is told from multiple perspectives. This layered telling builds up a nuanced picture of the society, and there's considerable intellectual heft to the material, which ranges through art history, court life, religious doctrine, and a host of other subjects.

I say sort-of, because although the plot definitely features a murdered artist, and his group of colleagues, one of whom killed him - which one, we do not find out till the very end - the book as a whole is more concerned with the differences between Western and Eastern traditional art, which in turn reflects on the differences between cultures - and with the culture of Turkish Islam, in general. And - I found it to be a bit surprising - I also found it to be subtly but viciously critical of that culture..

35648135,Nidhi,"It's a Turkish novel on the time frame of Ottoman empire in 1591, the story set in Istanbul. The combination of mystery + art + religion + love story + historical fiction. Well let's just say not everyone will like it considering the length to which it was discussed with philosophical theme about how a person perceives different topics.. There are various narrators and the absurdity with which they would directly talk to the reader will catch your attention. Also the fact that the narrator thinks the reader just didn't read last few pages to understand what's going on, so they have to clarify their intentions in case the reader(you) take matters in your own hand. Religious basis with idolatry play a very vital part in some narrator's way of living and thinking which shapes the discourse the story takes.. .. Regarding the story - the illumination art is the basic life of the characters- 'the minisaturists'- in which they are spending their lives to create the work for the Sultan, refuge of the world. In which 1 artwork is all about circumcision ceremony of the prince, which was referenced numerous times. The other major artwork is which causes all the fuss, since art is the way of reaching to the one and only. So if it is to be messed with, then you get a long 671 pages book. The fuss includes how western culture is taking a prominent shape in minds of people hence destroying the image of the illustrating art which is being taught and practiced throughout the lives of miniaturists.. .. Well that was the story. The other things which were a character sketch were, wait for it, obviously men who shape everything around them. Who attains wisdom of the world and apply it the lives of each and every living/dead/inanimate things on earth. Somehow apparently many have huge crushes on their apprentice in which the age gap toxicity reaches to a point where a 119 year old is in love with a 16 year old. So there's that to vomit about.. The women are the only real thing with whom you will see as an outsiders. They are there as slaves and non slaves -belonging to the father, husband or the family of dead husband. Still -Shekure takes her decisions in the little space she was allowed to have + her manipulative love story where the man claiming to love her will behave viciously for not performing acts he wants + her being a mother figure to 30+ grown ass man. There is Esther who is infact the most independent of all and is a part of everyone's lives with some actual human knowledge and qualities.. Everyone distrust everyone. Everyone somehow are all gossip mongers. Sometimes you will think you are reading an art illustration. Sometimes the absurdity of the devil taking all dark actions which were actually conscious human actions, but you know what i mean. Its an interesting read with many things still commonly seen as humans are constant, just times have changed. The thing you won't like are the philosophical parables which are meant to explain things but just are there. Fast read, translation is good, some readers will see the writing style read somewhere and you won't feel out of place with the theme.","Jul 28, 2018"
54686045,Sam,"I was recommended to read this book by a shop owner when I was in Selçuk, Turkey, in 2018. We were discussing Kurdish history in Turkey, and I learned that Pamuk was charged for the public denigration of Turkish identity due to his remarks made in an interview regarding Armenian and Kurdish genocide. Completing this novel had a lot of significance to me because of the shop owner's passion for this book and the conversation we had. Unfortunately, this book took me very long to complete and had a few difficult areas. In addition to this, if you are someone who cannot stand ""men writing women"", you will dread a few moments in this book.. Regardless, I thought that. My Name is Red. was beautifully written. The amount of detail for each character's perspective never came off wordy. Details had meaning and it was very easy to become immersed in Istanbul's Ottoman court.. I don't want to be a tree, I want to be its meaning.. It's all about perspective. Is the subject of an illustration depicted the way it was at that time? Can we trust what is in an illustration to be true? I find it very interesting that the possible inaccuracies in how subjects are portrayed can alter history, even in today's mediums.. Every chapter will make you question the murder mystery. Who will you sympathize with? I'm still contemplating.","Nov 18, 2019"
20234777,June,"The opening narrator is called The Corpse who is suitably angry at the man responsible for his death. This setup captivated my interest and attention. It becomes clear that his work as a miniaturist is key to solving the crime. But instead of a straightforward whodunnit, the bulk of this novel explores miniaturist art and religion, mainly Islam. The bulk of this book is about art, religion and the philosophy of art. We get a view of afterlife based on two murdered characters. There are even unusual narrators which was fascinating and appealing for me. But this book was became a challenge as I know nothing about art, or Turkish history. I was willing to persist as the writing is good. But the coarse sexual content was too much for me. This accompanied by the repetitive content of some characters which didn’t add value to the story for me. Overall, I thought there was great potential to learn about Turkish culture and a bit about art. But this was not the book for me.","Apr 02, 2019"

What amazes me is the amount of research Pamuk did on the art and culture of this period especially the miniaturists. Each chapter is written from different angles of individuals in the book. So you get to read the different angles of the same situation from different individuals. I have never read a book of this sort of presentation.

89242656,Diana,"My Name is Red [1998/2001] – ★★★★★. “Why does man not see things? He is himself standing in the way: he conceals things.” “What are man’s truths ultimately? Merely his irrefutable errors“. (Friedrich Nietzsche). In My Name is Red by Nobel Laureate Orhan Pamuk, murder of one miniaturist – Elegant Effendi – was committed within the circle of miniaturists working for the Sultan in medieval Istanbul. At the same time, thirty-six year old Black returns to his hometown of Istanbul after his twelve years’ absence to seek once again the hand of his beloved Shekure, an opportunity that was denied to him twelve years previously. Unwittingly, Black becomes entangled in the intrigues of miniaturists working under Enishte Effendi, Black’s uncle and Shekure’s father. Masterfully, Pamuk takes us deep within the art circle of medieval craftsmen who labour to produce a mysterious new book, a circle repleted with professional jealousy, narcissism, hidden love and, above all, differences as so the proper way of painting and representing pictures under one strict religious canon. In this historical novel, Persian art-forms clash violently with rising Venetian art influences as Black starts to realise that, in order to find the murderer of Elegant Effendi, it is necessary to go deep into the worldviews and art opinions of each of the three suspected miniaturists – “Stork”, “Olive” and “Butterfly”, testing their loyalties and beliefs. It is impossible not to get swept away by this novel of great insight and intelligence. My Name is Red is like a rich, tightly-woven exotic tapestry whose secrets lie in elaborate details, red herrings and in the depth of the soul of its maker, celebrating the beauty, imagination and intelligence of ancient artworks and methods of painting.. First of all, My Name is Red is an intriguing murder-mystery that plays with the reader, challenging him or her to identify the murderer before they reach the end. There are some clues as to the identity of the murderer scattered about in the narrative as we read about secrets that harbour the four great miniaturists – “Stork”, “Olive”, “Butterfly” and murdered Elegant Effendi – while working for the Sultan through both Master Osman and Enishte Effendi. These two masters have different views about the rise in popularity of Venetian art-forms and their influence on their traditional methods of painting. Who could have killed Elegant Effendi? Another jealous miniaturist? Or maybe a religious fanatic dissatisfied with the way the four miniaturists started working on a new book in secrecy? What is the nature of the new book commissioned by the Sultan? Was it really designed to depict images that go contrary to Islamic faith? Black soon finds himself tasked not only with winning Shekure and her father’s affection, but also finding the murderer as another murder is committed soon afterwards and Shekure feels torn between her allegiance to her brother-in-law (as matrimonial law dictates since her husband has not been declared legally dead) and her devotion to her father. Black realises that, to know the identity of the murderer, it is necessary to go to the earliest foundations of Persian art, its inspirations and consider the nature of its relationship with its western counterpart. Pictures start to speak volumes in the book as Black discovers how past artworks shaped the present miniaturists’ styles and it is here that the answer to the murder puzzle may lie.. Two previous books that I reviewed – Mohsin Hamid’s Moth Smoke [2000] and Elif Shafak’s 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World [2019] can be compared to My Name is Red since the three most likely drew inspiration from a common source/literary tradition. “Coincidentally”, Shafak’s book 10 Minutes 38 Seconds begins the same way as Pamuk’s My Name is Red – one spirit of a dead person starts talking to us, explaining their curious position and seeking retribution. In My Name is Red, the spirit of dead Elegant Effendi, whose corpse was thrown into a well, starts to recall his life and we get to know his professional circle. Also, as in Mohsin Hamid’s Moth Smoke, My Name is Red presents its story from the multitude of viewpoints, each competing for our attention as we read on and each trying to convince us with its rightness. If in Moth Smoke, there were only three or four other perspectives, in My Name is Red there are perspectives of Black, Shekure, Esther, Enishte Effendi, Master Osman, the three remaining miniaturists, not to mention the perspectives of inanimate objects and animals. The book results in a psychologically-intense ride that presents curious (sometimes black humour) situations that are recounted from different points of view. It is as though Pamuk does not let us see the wood for the trees – as we read on, we are blinded or diverted by different subjective opinions which do not let us see the broader picture or “objective” truth. Paradoxically, we, as readers, are both omniscient as to what is going on and “blind” at the same time because, even though we are cognisant of what is going on in the minds of each of the narrators, we are not told the most important thing and get lost in numerous details of the narration.. Secondly, My Name is Red is a deep reflection on the nature and the making of art – on its outside influences and development. Pamuk pits the Eastern tradition of art presentation (that puts emphasis on repetition and on the anonymity of artists) against the Western influence (including signatures and portraiture). Many characters in the novel lament the growing “westernisation” of their art, fearing what will be the final consequence regarding their religion and traditions. Something is being lost in their loyalty and devotion to Allah as art starts imitating life too closely (only Allah can be the source of all true creations) and certain unworthy personages take the central stage in paintings. There are also fears of Ottoman art’s historic roots and old masters’ methods being forgotten and ignored through the vanity of certain miniaturists who want to leave their own signatures or new styles behind. Thus, amidst the murder-mystery, there are also fables told on painters’ styles being equated with mistakes and on the admirable nature of blindness for artists as Black tries to make sense of this paradox of the trade of making pictures in a Muslim city, hoping it will lead him to the murderer: “the sincerity of the miniaturist….doesn’t emerge in moments of talent and perfection; on the contrary, it emerges through slips of the tongue, mistakes, fatigues and frustration” [Pamuk/Göknar: 1998/2001: 243]; “what exposes us is not the subject, which others have commissioned from us…but the hidden sensibilities we include in the painting as we render that subject” [Pamuk/Göknar: 1998/2001: 422]; “a great painter does not content himself by affecting us with his masterpieces; ultimately he succeeds in changing the landscape of our minds” [Pamuk/Göknar: 1998/2001: 258]. Pamuk lets us step within the beautiful paintings of the old masters of the Ottoman Empire and we walk through the armies and lovers gazing at each other across the distance, enabling our imagination to fuse with the best paintings made in the Middle East.. There is a third aspect to My Name is Red. We get to know Shekure, the beautiful daughter of Enishte Effendi, quite well – her husband is presumed dead after he marched to war four years ago and she is left with her two young sons. The arrival of Black disrupts her brother-in-law Hasan’s courtship of her and we realise that Black has always been passionately in love with Shekure…or has he? Here, art creeps in once again and life starts imitating art. The subjective nature of love is linked to the subjective viewing of artworks, and Black and Shekure’s courtship is linked to one of the oldest Persian fables – Hüsrev and Shirin by Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi, as well as to the falling in love with the presentation of the image of one’s beloved first: “love…must be understood, not through the logic, but through its illogic” [1998/2001: 658]. The colour red subtly creeps in and repeats itself where we find ourselves closer to truth. Red stands for blood and violence, but also for passion as Black’s lust becomes uncontrollable even though his heart remains “pure” like that of a child: “for if a lover’s face survives emblazoned on your heart, the world is still your home” [1998/2001: 49]. Satan and Death both have their say in this book too – “what we essentially want is to draw something unknown to us in all its shadowiness, not something we know in all its illumination” [1998/2001: 202], and, by the end, the book becomes one unforgettable adventure into the mysteries of art, life, love and death.. The conclusion is that My Name is Red, translated from the Turkish by Erdağ Göknar, is an evocative, richly-layered and vivid murder-mystery with one unusual structure that immerses us into the mysteries of Ottoman paintings and in the atmosphere of medieval Istanbul. It is a true page-turner steeped in the history of the Ottoman art where fables and reality, as well as life and art, inexplicably merge to produce a one-of-a-kind story.","Mar 31, 2020"

4146169,Karishma,"My Name is Red is a book I've owned for nearly seven years and not got around to reading till recently. It was fitting that it had come out when it did, soon after the Twin Towers fell and the American war on terror began.. Of course, the book is set in Istanbul at the time of the European Renaissance and when Emperor Akbar of India, poised as a patron of all art ensured a time of peace and prosperity that attracted artists from far and wide.. The book within the book is commissioned by the Turkish Sultan and is supposed to demonstrate his power to the Italians and the miniaturists preparing it in secret, are assigned to mimic the individualistic perspectival style of the Renaissance masters instead of the classical Islamic miniature painting style where pictures were accessories to words in books, a mere extension of the text, almost like border engravings.. This is the source of much conflict and contemplating within the book and also the subject of its most moving passages.. There are the miniaturists devoted to their art of painting by attempting perfection like the old Persian masters practiced, but also craving distinction, they envy the Europeans their individual style, which placed subjects at the centre of the universe and allowed the artist to become ambitious and pioneering, then there are the master miniaturists who try and fail to walk a line between the new and the old, the East and the West, their persecutors the hardline preachers and clerics who claim that Allah does not condone painting, or music or even, coffee and there's the Sultan who like all political leaders in history , cares more about showing off his power than any actual stylistic revolution in art.. The book itself is written in the individual style the Turks anguish about. Each chapter from the point of view of a different person, which means some chapters are profound and others hopelessly mundane - an effect that makes one wonder if it was intentional.. I did enjoy the book but somehow felt it would have been better in the original and loses something in translation.. Istanbul or Constantinople as it was once called, is a fascinating place, located at the intersection of the East and the West, torn in two directions and enriched by rivaling civilisations, as it struggles to balance the modern with the traditional. It's an interesting conflict, more than familiar to someone of my nationality and age.. To paint as one sees, or as God sees. To paint the object or its meaning. To follow the East or the West - these are questions the people in the book pose to themselves and each other till a character quotes from the Koran - to God belongs the East and the West.. And never the twain do meet.","Aug 13, 2010"
4174950,Elizabeth Sulzby,"I have just finished reading My Name is Red and am now going back and tracing the murderer character through his/her strands (his/her so as not to spoil the mystery for other readers). Then I want to use the chronology at the end of the book to compare with the stories that the various characters tell about the development of illumination of texts within the development of Islam as Pamuk puts these strands together in this book.. I had a hard time getting into the book and had to reread the first 4-5 chapters to get started. Then the book grabbed me and I read straight through. I listed it as fiction but also as philosophy/religion. I should list it as art history as well. While I read it I was listening to audio CD's of Proust's Swann's Way which I had read in hardback when I was in college. Both books are very complex in weaving together the stories of a number of characters embedded in culture and memory.. I have read The Museum of Innocence, Snow, Silent House and next will read Other Colors, all by Pamuk. I read the first three before I went to Istanbul this past September. Turning to My Name is Red which is set in Istanbul in the 16th Century let me re-vision Istanbul back in history. Some of the events happen near the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, and the Hippodrome, for instance.. I was fascinated by the time that Black and the Master Illuminator Osman spent in the archives of the Shah in the Treasury at Topkapi Palace. These archives contained a huge collection of illuminated books from across centuries--within which Black and Master Osman search for clues to solve the mystery around which their innocence depends. If Black in particular cannot prove his innocence by finding evidence of the guilty murderer, then he and the other artists will have to be tortured to lead to ""the truth"" of the guilty party. I was struck by Master Osman's fascination of a collection of paintings of forms of torture which Pamuk describes in gruesome length. Then the Master reflects that he and his fellow apprentices were tortured by their masters in order to keep their art pure and becoming more proficient!. There is a love story which I found strange, annoying, and still intriguing. One of the comments on the back of the book compares Pamuk's writings to Borges but I compared this love story more to Marcel Marquez in 100 Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera.","Sep 15, 2010"

15024040,Jenn,"This is a most curious and fascinating thriller, vividly portraying 16th century Istanbul at the height of the Ottoman Empire. It’s many stories in one – a murder mystery, a portrayal of the claustrophobic world of the miniaturist and the tensions between east and west, a love affair, a description of the sumptuous and terrifying court of the Sultan and a tribute to dazzling Istanbul.. I loved it, confusing at times because it is such a distant world to a 21st century westerner, but if you want to be transported away into another place this is your book. It could be described as a Muslim `Name of the Rose’. The story revolves around the conflict facing the Miniaturists when their traditional and very stylised method of art comes up against the European Renaissance. Miniaturists would be selected from boyhood and then would spend an arduous period of apprenticeship learning their craft. They would devote their lives to their art, following strict protocols and traditions and probably ruining their eyes in the process. It helped I like art anyway, so was very open to hearing about the intricate techniques, colours and the stories of artists across the Islamic world.. Apparently the Sultan of the time was an art lover. His name was Sultan Murad III, 1546-1595 – roughly contemporary with Elizabeth I of England (and in fact they mention a present from the English monarch at one point). The Ottoman Empire was the gateway to the East, immensely powerful and juxtaposed to maritime Venice. I read somewhere there was expected to be a showdown during this period between East and West, Islam and Christianity. Erasmus predicted the total destruction of one party or another, but it never happened, each side settling for rivalry in trade instead.. The story centres on the murder of one Miniaturist – was it done by a religious fundamentalist? Or was it for professional jealousy? Parmuk writes each chapter from a different viewpoint, even having the murderer’s viewpoint on a few occasions. Interspersed with this are descriptions of Istanbul – which personally I loved, a most interesting city. He really takes you back to the narrow courtways, the linden trees, coffee houses, the Jewish quarter - I do like books when you can immerse yourself in the place being written about, and `My Name is Red’ certainly achieves that.","Nov 22, 2016"

29160274,Czarny Pies,"It is August 20, 2014. I had an ""Orhan Pamuk"" at lunch today when I decided to go to neighbourhood Shawarma joint for lunch. My purpose was to practice my German with the owner who is a Kurd who had been educated in Munich. Today, however, he was too upset to have any patience for my feeble efforts in German. Instead he was very upset by the plight of the Yazidis in his homeland.. He explained to me: ""Something needs to be done to protect the Yazidis. We were all once Zoroastrians. The Iraqis should not be attacking these people. They should respect them and leave them in peace."". This is essentially the big theme of ""My name is Red"". Muslims who have chosen to live in Western society ask themselves to what extent their identity derives from the fact that they are Muslims given the fact that they were once before something else. There are in fact no indigenous Muslims. Those in the Middle East had been Christians prior to the rise of Islam whereas in Iran and much of the neighbouring territories, they had been Zoroastrians.. The second question facing the Westernized muslim is what to do with the Muslim component of his or her identity in a secular society. What should be retained and what can be dropped without compromising fundamental principles.. My Name is Red examines the confrontation between an non-Islamic artistic style and a strain of Islam that wished to imposes its views on art whether or not God really wanted as much..

39033898,Gohar Khokhar,"for me this was the first time reading a novel written in a style in which every character is speaking to you, and i liked this style, as it helped me in building a better connection with every character.. i believe this is not a book which you can finish in two days, it requires time and careful reading and as in my case where i am not at all familiar with painting and other related stuff, i had to keep my focus to absorb the fine details.. To enjoy the book you should picture yourself as someone having a cup of coffee and listening to a friend across a table. This is a must read novel for all those who have interest in painting/ sketching etc. Specially young artists growing up in central Asia, middle east and south Asia must read this. I am sure they will understand few things quicker than many other.. This book introduces reader with Islamic style of paintings and how that is different from western style or as in the novel it is called Venetian style. Before reading this, i saw miniature art many times but i never realise the depth in them, i never thought about the reason behind the development of this form of art. i never thought the stories hidden in them, it has introduced me to a wonderful form of art and for that i am grateful to orhan.. In addition to a book on art, i also consider this a book in which the concept behind the use of certain color, certain way of sketching, certain style of painting and use of certain tools is explained in a different way.. after reading this i realised that majority of artist across globe now follows Venetian style which was presented as something substandard and against the Islamic principle throughout the book.","Sep 08, 2015"
4903281,Philippe,"I read this book a couple of years ago in rather unusual circumstances. I was on a ski expedition in a very remote area in the Himalayas. For weeks our small group was completely cut off from human civilization. I didn’t bring the book but my tentmate did. It was my first encounter with Pamuk. Initially I was captivated. The author’s deftness in conjuring up a strange, exotic world made a deep impression. But as my reading progressed I became nervous and very frustrated. The narrative’s labyrinthine quality and the opulence of its setting oppressed me. There may have been an unanticipated interaction with the extraordinary environment we found ourselves in. We had been in this glacier basin for weeks, steadily climbing to a high pass. It was a landscape unlike anything I had seen. Also the rarefied air caused me problems. I slept fitfully, plagued by persistent nightmares. At one point I dreamed about Pamuk’s ‚Red’. Not literally, but there was no doubt in my mind that the novel had worked its way into my subconscious. The dream was a visceral experience of Derrida’s ‚infinite play’: disorienting and exhausting, but in equal measures philosophically insightful. Since I have been thoroughly apprehensive of reading another book by Pamuk. But it is also true that very few novels have had this kind of impact on me. The mere association with Pamuk stirs strong emotions. At one point I will have the courage to break the spell. But not quite yet.","Aug 11, 2014"
56111782,B Sarv,"I started reading this Nobel Prize winning novel with a bit of apprehension. Lately, since I’ve been writing reviews of a lot of books, while I am reading I try to picture what it is I will write as I am going along. But it was a little intimidating to think of how I might review a novel which had won the highest accolade in modern literature. For me the approach to telling the story is one of the main things that gripped me. In addition, it has a murder mystery, romance and intrigue. By the time I finished I realized that it was a novel that captured and illuminated many aspects of human behavior and it had piqued my curiosity.. While the idea of “breaking the fourth wall” generally refers to performances in theatre or movies, Mr. Pamuk employs this device throughout his novel. In every chapter characters and even inanimate objects (which are sometimes the main character of the chapter) address the reader directly. And so we hear from the corpse, the murderer (even though his identity is not immediately revealed), a coin, death, a tree, the love struck, and other characters critical to the story. Perhaps it was the way the reader is directly addressed that, in part, attracted the attention of the Nobel Prize committee. As I mentioned above, it is certainly one of the things that captured my attention. The story is set in the late 1500s in Istanbul, Turkey. This setting and era may set up challenges to the reader; more on this later.. One example of “breaking the fourth wall” is when the reader is addressed by a coin; a coin which happens to be a counterfeit. The coin describes all of its adventures since it was minted; a description which makes me want to wash my hands every time I handle money. As it is reflecting upon its existence the coin tells the reader, “Many of the people who hold me want to be rid of me as soon as possible, especially if they discover I’m fake. Nonetheless, I have yet to come across someone who’ll warn an unsuspecting buyer that I’m counterfeit. A broker, not recognizing that I’m counterfeit, who has counted out 120 silver coins in exchange for me, will berate himself in fits of anger, sorrow and impatience as soon as he learns he’s been cheated, and these fits won’t subside until he rids himself of me by cheating another. During this crisis, even as he attempts to repeatedly swindle others, failing each time on account of his haste and anger, he’ll continue all the while to curse the “immoral” person who originally conned him.” (p. 105). Here the author not only captures the perspective of the coin in an imaginative and creative manner, he uses the opportunity to make a humorous commentary on human behavior. This is but a small of example of the intriguing nature of this novel.. A character named Black Effendi is the protagonist of the story. (Effendi is a title of respect in Turkey) The action of the story centers on his efforts to renew his courtship of his younger cousin, who was married and widowed during his 12-year exile from Istanbul (for proclaiming his love for her). In the story he is also tasked with identifying the murderer of his uncle (the second murder in the story). In the opening of a chapter entitled “I am called Black” the character reveals something of himself: “Maybe you’ve understood by now that for men like myself, that is, melancholy men for whom love, agony, happiness and misery are just excuses for maintaining eternal loneliness, life offers neither great joy nor great sadness. I’m not saying we can’t relate to other souls overwhelmed by these feelings, on the contrary, we sympathize with them. What we cannot fathom is the odd disquiet our souls sink into at such times. This silent turmoil dims our intellects and dampens our hearts, usurping the place reserved for the true joy and sadness we ought to experience.” (p. 245). I was so struck by this passage that I re-read it several times. I reflected how profoundly, to me, this author had captured such a relatable aspect of life.. Later, when confronted with the murderer Black engages in the following exchange:. “God willing, one day, we will fearlessly tell the story of our own lives that way we actually live them.”. “All fables are everybody’s fables,” said Black. “All illumination is God’s illumination too.” I said, completing the verse by the poet Hatifi of Herat.”. Two aspects of this exchange merit comment. First, is the idea that “All fables are everybody’s fables” struck me at the time as being an important truth. That in every story there are threads that link all human beings with every other human being. And perhaps that is the appeal of novels – the extended stories that we read appeal to something in ourselves – how our own story connects or diverges from the story we are reading. The second is the murderer’s reference to a poet from Herat (a city in Afghanistan). This reference leads me to one of the other main points of interest to me that arose while reading this book.. This is a work of historical fiction that is remarkable to me for its detail. Throughout the story, like the reference I comment on above, the author makes frequent allusions to events in the history of the Ottoman Empire and nations, peoples and empires surrounding it. In the process I realized that there is an enormous gap in my knowledge of world history. I tried not to spend too much time researching the events the author alluded to because I knew that if I did that I would probably spend the whole year reading this book. Still, this did pique my interest in learning more about that history. I simply dislike being completely unaware of the subject.. In addition, the author made frequent allusions to, poetry, literature, myths and legends, apparently well known at that time, from the perspectives of the characters in the book. One which made frequent appearance was the legend of Husrev and Shirin. Its repeated appearance in the novel compelled me to read something about this legend in order to become familiar with the allusion. I was glad that I did so, as it was an interesting story. Still, I was left with many other allusions to legends that would be familiar to the people in that setting which I did not pursue. My curiosity is not dimmed, so I need only time, energy and resources to learn more. I think this novel has something for anyone who enjoys murder mystery, romance and a new and different way of looking at oneself and the world we share with others. I recommend this book.","Oct 30, 2019"
107133539,Teagan Cameron,"Overall, this book was intriguing and brilliantly executed. I learned a great deal about the Ottoman Empire by reading it while reading a beautiful novel. Admittedly the structure of the novel is a bit odd, but I got used to it very quickly and it only enhanced the reading experience. The first chapter, written from the perspective of the corpse, hooks the reader from the very first sentence and reveals the main conflict of the novel very early on. The conflict, that between old values and those of the European world, still resonates today; however, the setting of 1591 Istanbul provides added dimensions to this conflict. The subtle details of the novel from the historical reality allow the reader to inhabit the world in which the characters live and bring it to vivid life. The reader is permitted to use this context as a mirror to view the central tensions in their own life, gaining insight on its form through the perspectives of different characters.. As I read it for a class, my focus was largely on the novel's historical qualities and details, which only enhance its message. I have recommended this to others and will continue to do so, both to lovers of literature and to students of history.","Dec 27, 2019"
7278262,Sher,"This book gets a 5 for creativity and innovation, but it was a chore to read. Each chapter is short or long and titled ""I am called Black"" or ""I am a woman, "" or ""I am called Butterfly."" Each chapter is a different voice and a different point of view, And some of the narrators are noticeable unreliable, which is part of the art form of the writer. It's a mystery, but not in the normal sense. The book is about traditional art forms (art that copied the great masters and did not show any innovation) compared to innovation and personal style being reflected in art. It's about this conflict present in illustration and miniaturist painting before the Renaissance. Each chapter has something to do with this theme, and all around it are the lives of the master engravers, their lovers, their opinions on this highly charged topic. I read this during a time of being forced to read various other dense books for school, so I was hoping for something a little lighter. It's a real work of literary art, but it's a chore to read, and for me - it was just okay. I still may try another Pamuk-- later in the year","Jan 09, 2014"
36030,Kecia,"Dense and lush. It's a murdery mystery. It's a love story. All set against a backdrop of a changing world.. While Europe was in the dark ages the Islamic world flourished. Then came the Italian renaissance. This story is set against the tension of this changing world. The conservative Turks holding desparately to their art tradition. Looking to their relegion to justify their position. All the while they are seduced by what the more progressive West had to offer. They fully understand that the art world has shifted and that they are being left behind, but they are not ready to fully embrace this new idea of a personal style.. This book is not for everyone. It's long and can be dry from time to time. But the plot does move along quickly. Each chapter is told from the POV of a different character which keeps it interesting to me. I enjoyed reading about Eastern vs Western art from the Eastern perspective, but some people may not.. I'm looking forward to reading more from Pamuk after this one.","Apr 09, 2012"
2338568,B. Asma,"People who like art will like this novel set in 1591 Istanbul. Based in history, this fictional account of conflict between traditional miniature painting and innovative perspectival representation recreates the late-sixteenth-century Ottomans. Other people preferring an uninterrupted narrative without an artistic or historical partiality will find several chapter-hopping narrators and an unreliable narrator a bit of a stop-and-go and a constant reorienting. For all that, the characters captivate by their illogical, fiendish, human weaknesses and their blissful joy in the worlds of miniaturization and love.. This is a who-done-it without the clean, crisp edges of Sherlock Holmes. It is messy and indirect getting to the heart of the matter, but Pamuk applies his unlimited imagination, literary technique, and period knowledge to excellent effect. It all seems very real-to-life.","Mar 07, 2012"

This is one really complicated novel. Set in sixteenth-century Ottoman Empire, it opens with a corpse speaking from the bottom of a well, wondering if anyone's noticed his disappearance yet. Orhan Pamuk uses numerous first-person narrators, including a dog, a tree, a gold coin, and the color red. When a second murder occurs, the dead man's daughter agrees to marry a childhood friend, but only if he'll find the murderer.. It's a book that lends itself to discussion, in part just to figure out what's going on, and to share in the research of religion and culture, ideas assumed by the writer to be known, but which left me wondering how much I was missing..

Pamuk is a fantastic writer, using a style and words that only can be compared to the detailed drawings his main characters put on paper in the story. Pamuk takes the time to describe what's going on, both around his characters and in their heads.. He chose an interesting viewpoint by having a different 'I' in each chapter, even including a coin, a dog a color, hence the title, and death.

63131915,Fatima,"This a beautifully intricate story depicting a whole era and culture of miniature art. My Name is Red is mostly about Black, his melancholy force befitting the setting sun of arts in the late 16th century at the time of Murad III. It is a mystery murder, whereas the bigger dilemma is an art, on whom thousands of masters have spent their whole lives, embellishing and going blind, is coming to an end.. It also deals with the themes of art and relegious fundamentalism of Islam and how an artist fights his inner devils.. Shekure was a nice and light side of a picture for me, I can call her a Boss Lady.. And the one I loved was Esther, though a meander character but nonetheless she was Sherlock of her own time..

Sometimes the characters got a bit annoying, namely Shekure. She got on my nerves with her wishy-washy indecisiveness, so much so that I wished I could be inside the book and shake some sense into her.

21147300,Bill Purkayastha,"The scene: The Italian Alps.. The year: 1327.. The background: It’s the late medieval period. The Crusades are over, the Holy Land lost beyond recovery. There are no external enemies to fight. Christianity is now divided against itself, between Pope and Emperor, the secular and the ecclesiastical, heresy and logic, the old and the new.. The plot: Someone is killing the inmates of a remote Benedictine monastery in bizarre ways, and the monks take this as a sign of the Devil at work and of the approaching Apocalypse. Enter the narrator, a novice Benedictine called Adso of Melk, and his mentor, an English Franciscan monk by the name of William of Baskerville. They are there to attend a theological conference, but William, who has experience as an investigator, is charged by the Abbot to look into the murders, not just to find the truth but if necessary to cover it up for the “greater good” of the Church – for if it is the Devil at work, he is to be countered, but if it is a monk who is to blame, William should be careful that the ordinary people – the “sheep” – do not grow to distrust all their “shepherds”.. As more bodies turn up, William is confronted with the mystery of symbols and contexts, and how the past influences the present. When an inquisitor arrives to carry out his own hunt for heretics, Satanists and witches, William’s position becomes more difficult still, but he is still determined to get to the bottom of the mystery.. The scene: Istanbul, Turkey.. The year: 1591.. The background: The Turkish Empire is caught between two forces. On the east is the Persian Safavid Empire. On the west are the Venetians and the other “Franks” – the Europeans, who are well into the Renaissance and whose military prowess is far less important than their flowering of modern thought and culture. Turkey can no longer stay insulated from foreign ideas and ideals, and this arouses resistance – as always – from various quarters, and for different and often conflicting reasons.. The plot: One of the Sultan’s master miniaturists is murdered and his body thrown into a well. The man was one of a small and highly select group of painters and gilders entrusted by the Sultan with a secret commission: to create a book of illustrations in the “modern” European style instead of the traditional Afghan and Persian style rigidly adhered to by the miniaturists of the Muslim world of the time. The European style is thought to be bordering on the blasphemous by both the traditional miniaturists and the mullahs of the mosques, for different reasons, and the killing of the master gilder, Elegant Effendi, could be an attempt to stop the book from being created – or could it?. Enter Black, once an apprentice painter, who went into self-exile for twelve years after falling in love with his maternal uncle’s daughter. Now, the maternal uncle has called him back to Istanbul to help him complete the book, and Shekure, the cousin he was in love with, has a husband presumed dead in the wars and is living with her father with her two sons.. When the killer strikes again, Shekure tells Black he can have her if he finds the killer and takes care of her and her two children. And meanwhile, the Sultan’s officers suspect Black himself of being involved in the killings.. The first of these books is The Name Of The Rose, by the Italian academic and novelist Umberto Eco (please note that I am talking about the book, not about the film, which many more people are familiar with). The second is My Name Is Red, by Turkish Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk. Written a couple of decades apart by different authors living in different countries, it’s still extremely usual to read of one compared to the other, specifically Red to Rose, as though the two were in competition.. I’ve read both these books, and I believe that though they can be read, and enjoyed, individually, they form two parts of a diptych; one compliments and buttresses the other. In this article I’ll try and discuss how.. The first piece of similarity is the fact that they are both putative detective stories, where the detection part doesn’t really matter in itself. To put it differently, neither is an Agatha Christie style murder mystery where everything hinges on the final revelation and the identity of the killer. In both these books, the identity of the murderer is almost incidental, and the detective story is only a hook on which to hang the rest of the novel.. Both these novels are historical novels, and historical novels in a dual sense. Not only are they set in the fairly remote past, but they are both all about history – how the past influences (their) present, and how it is essential to interpret the past in order to understand what is happening around the characters.. In both novels the real battle is essentially one of ideas – the new flooding in and being desperately resisted by the old. In The Name Of The Rose it is the flowering of logical thought that led to the Renaissance, which is so bitterly resisted by the entrenched Church which had so much at stake in keeping the masses poor, ignorant, and afraid. A relatively minor character in terms of the number of pages he occupies, the inquisitor Bernard Gui (a genuinely nasty piece of work who actually existed and was responsible for burning upwards of forty people at the stake) is the embodiment of this reaction. All Bernard wants is heretics to burn; he cares for nothing else, as though destroying free thought and other kinds of “heresy” can hold back the flood of modernity. He will bully and browbeat his suspects into admitting their guilt, twisting their words so that they can say nothing that does not incriminate them. And that is why he is a successful inquisitor.. In My Name Is Red, the conflict of ideas takes the form, not of faith versus heresy, but of schools of painting. Medieval Islamic art was extremely stylised. It invariably showed the world, not as it actually was, but as “Allah” might see it from the top of a minaret, without any attempt at perspective or realism. Realism, in fact, was specifically discouraged, because that introduced the “personal element” of the artist’s vision. Since only Allah was perfect, only what Allah might see could be perfect and the artist tried to depict what he thought Allah would perceive of any given scene. And so the painting style became not just stylised but repetitive, with miniaturists striving to paint exactly as the old master miniaturists of such cities as Herat had done. And, in fact, this is the key to the killer – for the only clue to his identity is the fact that he has painted a realistic horse, not an ideal one, and therefore has a personal “style”.. Meanwhile, the realism of European style painting, with portraits which actually depicted people as they looked, and the world as it looked to a human being, was working its way into the Turkish consciousness, and no less a person than the Sultan himself had decided that he wanted his portrait painted in this style. The reactionaries fell into two camps – one, the traditional miniaturists, personified by Master Osman, the head of the artist’s workshop, who would rather go blind than paint in the European style; and the other the mullahs, who were opposed to all painting as being forbidden by the Koran, and blamed all the ills of the Empire on society’s moving away from Islam.. As with Bernard Gui in the Italian Alps, Pamuk’s book has an ecclesiastical opponent of all things modern, though he never personally makes an appearance. He is a cleric from Erzurum, one Nusret Hoja, who has by the end of the book gathered together a little private army of his own and is determined to force his vision of Islamic rectitude on society, by destroying coffee houses and dervish lodges. He’s a very Mullah Omar kind of figure, whom it is lethally dangerous to mock, as a storyteller who makes repeated appearances throughout the book discovers.. Another similarity is that by modern standards the motives of the two killers is laughable. But the situations of these two books aren’t modern, and the killers aren’t modern people. To them, in the darkness of their little medieval minds, their own purposes were perfectly logical, important and legitimate, no matter how insignificant they would seem to us from the standpoint of the 21st century. One wonders how our motives will be regarded by our descendants six or seven hundred years from now. Not very flatteringly, one feels.. There are many differences between the books, of course, and it’s possible to allude to only a few here; but the similarities in themes and ideas are far more important than the differences.. Taken as a detective story, pure and simple, there’s no comparison: The Name Of The Rose stands head and shoulders above My Name Is Red. Its detective, William of Baskerville, is an open tribute to Sherlock Holmes even to his name (taken from The Hound Of The Baskervilles), with Adso of Melk as a serviceable Watson. In his very first appearance, he makes a very Holmesesque deduction about the whereabouts, name and even the appearance of a runaway horse he has never seen before. He is methodical, knowledgeable, and fact-oriented, rejecting the then-standard belief that the Devil was behind all the evil of the world. William prefers a much more immediate malefactor. William’s motive is the search for truth.. In comparison, Black of My Name Is Red is only a reluctant detective, whose real motive is only to marry and then to sleep with Shekure, and it is only because she orders him to find the killer that he takes the task on himself. This burden takes on added urgency when the Sultan’s officials give him three days to track down the killer, or he and the miniaturists involved in the making of the Sultan’s book will all be put to the torture. And his deductive skills are anything but logical; he depends on serendipity and the aid of Osman in his detective endeavours, and is constantly distracted by Shekure and his own rejection by her children, not to speak of the fear of the torturers.. Then there’s the question of writing style. The Name Of The Rose is linear; told by Adso of Melk, everything that happens is narrated by him directly or as a matter of his knowledge. He thinks as a fourteenth-century monk might think, without a trace of liberalism, except that which has rubbed off on him from William. His characters come across as props for his account; he scarcely even bothers to describe most of them (except William himself), because, to paraphrase him, “What’s the point now? They’re all long dead anyway.” His account has long digressions into history, ecclesiastical expostulation, and symbolism, where the human element is entirely removed. It reads, as it is meant to, as a treatise more than a novel for much of its length.. My Name Is Red is anything but linear. Each chapter is told in a different voice, not just those of the main characters but of dogs and such, even of such intangibles as corpses, the Devil, and the colour red. Over and over, the same ideas and episodes are re-examined from different viewpoints and perspectives, almost as in the film Rashomon. Unlike Rose, Red’s characters are infinitely better drawn, which is rather natural when one looks at the personal voice in which the book is presented. And again unlike Rose, which has a grand total of one female character, who is not even allowed the dignity of a name, Red’s best drawn characters are women: there is Shekure herself, desperate for security for herself and her children, unsure of Black’s love for her, and dreading the brother of her late husband while at the same time retaining affection for him. There is Hayriye, her scheming slave girl, who hates her so much that she sleeps with Shekure's father, Black's uncle, as an act of revenge. There is Esther, the Jewish clothes peddler and itinerant matchmaker, who acts as a double and triple agent as she carries around messages between Shekure, Black, and Shekure’s brother-in-law Hasan. There is even the mythical character Shirin, who appears over and over again in paintings throughout the book, to the extent where she is almost a character herself.. Since these two books are allegedly detective stories, it would be unfair to completely ignore the killers, who are also very different, though, as I’ve said, their motives are equally nonsensical to a modern mind. My Name Is Red’s killer is actually easily guessable (at least I correctly guessed his identity halfway through the book from the clues liberally provided); his crimes are committed in the heat of passion, and one soon realises that he’s not really a bad man. The Name Of The Rose’s murderer is of a completely different nature, a cold and calculating psychopath who uses his own wits, knowledge and logic in his battle with William of Baskerville. He is a far more impenetrable and frightening figure, and one tracks him down alongside William, discovering the clues as William does (another way this book is Sherlock Holmes-esque rather than the whodunit type).. Both books are often slow-going and are emphatically not for those with short attention spans. Red has dashes of black humour, but humour is (and this turns out to be thematically significant) utterly lacking in Rose. In the end, though, neither book’s message is anything to laugh about – and that message is the same.. Personally, I preferred The Name Of The Rose, but that’s probably due to the fact that I read that book much earlier and because the constant shift of viewpoint in My Name Is Red isn’t suited to my tastes. But that’s only on a personal level – at the level of intellectual discussion, these two books strongly complement each other.. I suggest you read them both.","Feb 08, 2018"
2092969,Miriam,"I think I'm giving this book three stars knowing this guy is a Nobel prizewinner, rather than because I liked this book 3 stars. I more liked the book 2 stars, but I'm afraid.. This book is dumb. First, the narrative structure is repetitive. To have so many different people recounting events means that they repeat themselves. It would be one thing if they actually had different voices or unique points of view, but really all they do is pick up the story where the last one left off and go on, with some repetition for orientation. Different characters take somewhat different stances on art, but the writing is all the same and they are fundamentally indistinguishable from each other. And they mostly go back and forth over the idea that representation ""in the style of the Frankish masters"" is or is not sacrilegious. They articulate the different sides, but waffle on taking a position. One of the miniaturists had the characteristic that he wants to please everyone else more so than paint for the beauty of painting. But then in several other sections by different miniaturists, they ALL seemed like they wanted to please someone else and get them on their side. So it's not so much a distinguishing characteristic as a trait of miniaturists? Plus, then some of them say one thing out loud and then contradict it in their interior monologue, or change their mind later. The characters say and do things without clear motivation--one says he both wants to see the miniaturists tortured and also doesn't. But why? He never elaborates, just sets up the juxtaposition and goes on. Shekure is in addition another beautiful woman character of his with no depth or clear motivation. And her proclaimed drive to do everything for her children is in contrast to her use of them as pawns in her scheme to get remarried (which I suppose could be read as an attempt to provide for their future), to pit one against the other for her favor, and to hit them when they say things she doesn't like (not talking about discipline here, just things they say that she doesn't want to hear). She wants to sleep with them and snuggle but not have them grow up or have opinions or whatever. And her attitude toward her father's murder sounds traumatizing for them. I suppose a generous reading would say that most people say what they want and what they stand for but DO very different things, but that's more generous than I feel like being. It's just a jumbled mess. A long, slow jumbled mess.. And Pamuk stuck another character named Orhan into this and upended the narrative. Then he says that Orhan wrote the whole thing and not to trust him. That doesn't work with what all came before, and it's a meaningless twist for its own sake. Not good.. Spoiler alert: I kept reading because I wanted to find out who murdered the two people and why. The identity of the murderer mattered very little (as I said, fundamental sameness, hard to care about them as individuals) but the justification did add something to the discussion. Rather than focusing on the question of representation as sacrilege, the murderer insisted that the gilder wanted to undermine the workshop itself with his conservative views while the head of the project wanted glory for himself by courting the controversy itself. That's a twist.. I guess the themes of representation in art didn't resonate with me. I did enjoy reading the perspective of Istanbul artists about European ones, to think about the changes in art that accompanied the trade, wars, and cultural contact of the sixteenth century. How that would feel to have questions of perspective and artistic intent questioned in some very fundamental ways (what is the difference between the ideal horse as Allah sees it and the horse an artist is capable of drawing and the horse represented as a real horse, distinguishable from other horses?). The curiosity about other styles, the questioning about what an adoption of other styles would mean, the acknowledgement that even without European influence that different workshops evolve their own styles either as a group or a collection of individuals, the difference between the ""old masters"" and the later versions of other artists influenced by their own ideas, imperfections, varying talents. I think I'd rather read this story as nonfiction, with plates and plates of examples of the evolution of styles and the influence of various cultures (Persian, Chinese, Venetian) on miniature paintings, and some primary sources to explain the competing, conflicting views on art. This book is not that book.","Jun 08, 2019"
7908898,Paul,"A whodunnit, written in a kaleidoscope of voices, including the murderer and starting with the murdered, My Name is Red is a book about snow. I mean, it seems to snow all the time, snow is everywhere, sometimes several times in the same paragraph. Aside from the snow, it’s confusing to start with. In fact, as I reached chapter 9, I realised that Chapters 1 and 2 were completely different people, so that reset my points and pinged me off down slightly different tracks. So I read them again and then continued, oh Pamuk, you can’t outwit me that easily. Well I mean you did. but I get there eventually.. Elegant Effendi has been murdered! I know this because he tells me in the first chapter and he’s quite annoyed and upset about it, and he really doesn’t like his murderer, or the fact that no one know’s he’s been murdered, because he’s at the bottom of a well. A couple of chapters later the murderer is talking to me, but who is it? Black is called in to try and find out what happened to Elegant by his uncle, and as he investigates the world of Istanbul’s world of miniaturists, we are presented the story through the eyes of the people he interacts with as well as himself.. It’s all a bit complicated you see. Black’s uncle, also the father to the beautiful, capricious Shekure, who everyone in the world thinks is beautiful, has been commissioned by the Sultan to create a magnificent book, in the style of the damned Franks. This goes against everything that the miniaturists, the holy men and everyone in between believe in, as well as a tradition stretching back generations. But as in all times, a few coins slipped here and there, some men’s souls do not shine so bright as the luminous reflection of a few gold or silver pieces, the book is slowly put together, without anyone but Black’s uncle seeing the whole thing. What doesn’t help poor Black is that rumours are going around surrounding this book, and a zealous preacher is inciting hatred against everything that is not traditional (now that sounds vaguely familiar). It’s not all inkwells and innuendo about artist’s quill’s though. There’s a love interest. Black is in love (as is the murderer) with Shekure. She has moved back into her uncles following advances made by her missing husbands brother but she cannot hide forever, and her two young children need a dad, is Black man enough? While navigating a murder investigation, Black and Shekure court each other through the seller of wares and local cupid Esther, one of the books more engaging characters.. Pamuk uses a highly original style in My Name Is Red that means you have to think while you read, and being a man, meaning I can’t multitask, it takes a while to get used to, but never the less, it is still hugely enjoyable. The city, it’s people, their habits, their daily chores and errands, their food are all here, observed and followed by the characters as they narrate their way around their work and the murder that has engaged even the Sultan himself.. Not just a captivating murder mystery (a genre I have zero interest in, while I was intrigued about who the murderer was, I did not work it out until roughly the same time as Black) My Name Is Red is also an intricate look at the world of miniaturist painting in Istanbul, and across the Islamic world, it’s great proponents and place in the scheme of the religion and the more earthly rulers. While each of the subjects tell us how they are the best of their time, some rail against the Frankish methods, using perspective, painting portraits, that take painting away from how God sees the world, to how people see it, ultimately making people the centre piece of art, and not God himself. Yet still there is the recognition that everything they have achieved, everything they have striven for and created will be swept away by this new style from the West, a recognition and often fear that resonates particularly loudly today.. I’ve read Pamuk’s Istanbul, which I loved, even if I thought Pamuk himself came across as a little weird, eccentric, let’s go with eccentric. But I loved his prose, his view of the world, and I wanted to read more of his fiction after A Strangeness in my Mind which I also loved. Now, I think I’ll wrap up against the snow, and read another.. (blog review. here. )","Jul 02, 2018"
5456705,Mindy McAdams,"I could muster no enthusiasm for this book or the story it tells. It is at least twice as long as needed to tell the tale it encompasses, and as for the so-called mystery — the reader needs to care about something if a mystery is to be of interest, and there was just nothing to care about here. The dead man seems to have no personality at all, and that is true for all of the various potential suspects as well. It's not lost on me that maybe that blandness was a deliberate move on the author's part, because a central theme here is the absence of individualistic characteristics in the traditional form of painting in the Ottoman empire in the 1500s.. This Ottoman style of painting was inherited or adopted from the Persians, and the miniaturists in Istanbul in this story still revere those ancestors — but this is the era of western ascendancy, and some of these Istanbul painters have seen the new painting style from Europe. Renaissance painting features not only linear perspective but also distinctive individual styles, such that you can recognize who made a painting. This theme — the recognizability of style, and the ascendance of individualism over collectivism — is at the core of the story.. Unfortunately, it is repeated over and over and beaten to a pulp until I, as a reader, wanted to scream. Pamuk is far too good a writer to have dedicated time to such a draggy, dull tale.. The most interesting parts of the book, for me, were those told by two women — who are not even involved in the painting work, because of course women would never have been allowed to make art. Chapters are narrated in the first person by all the different characters. Esther (a Jewish peddler) and Shekure (a beautiful young widow with two children) were the most three-dimensional people in the story. However, their roles are really peripheral.. There was lots of potential here, but it's drowned in detail and redundancy. In particular, I liked the thread about the religious fanatics who are trying to destroy figurative painting altogether just now that it teeters on the edge of becoming individualistic. The painters talk about representing the world as God sees it, not as humans see it. They talk about transferring to their images God's vision of the world, and there's a mystical element beyond mere talent. (I am fascinated by Sufi dervishes and really enjoyed the mentions of them in this story.) This enables the miniaturists to defend their painting of human figures, even though the Quran explicitly forbids it.. I also think this book might have suffered from the translation. The language is rather wooden and dull. In. The Black Book. by the same author — which I loved and want to read again — the language was rich and tantalizing, lovely, lush. I fear that maybe the translator of. My Name Is Red. was not up to the task.","Apr 27, 2017"
39829724,جلجامش Nabeel,"It is an amazing novel; a mix of historical fiction, romance, and mystery. I enjoyed reading it discovering the life style, beliefs, art, and politics in the 16th century. The main issue the novel discusses is the conflict between west and east – as in all Pamuk’s novels – but here art is their battlefield. It showed me important things about the characteristic of western culture, which is individuality, something not recognized in the east. Even oriental miniaturists were not allowed to have their own style, and to follow the style of their old masters; this might indicate the oriental will to keep the traditions untouched. On contrary, in the west each innovation of creativity was welcomed and encouraged. The other thing is the conflict between religion and art in Islam, something so related to this era witnessing the rise of radical Islam and iconoclast, as the novel talks about a radical clergyman from Erzurum whose followers were accused of being behind the assassinations of miniaturists, and attacking coffee shops, and dervishes’ lodges. The novel gives us a glimpse on the Safavid-Ottoman wars in that period, the strong beliefs in Jinn, and mysterious things; Pamuk was so brilliant depicting the life of past in details. I loved knowing more about Persian and Ottoman art and poetry and many writers from the orient that I have never read for them before. This story was a way to discover new things on this region. I read on Ibn Shakir, a miniaturist from Baghdad who left the city after its sack by the Mongols. To this Baghdadi miniaturist the oriental style is attributed, after he drew the city from the top of minaret during the savage destruction by Hulagu Khan. The novel shows the conflict between those who want to follow the European styles, and those who want to preserve the past, and those who are against art and depiction figures. The mystery increases when we discover that the killer was not but the same brilliant miniaturist who drew the portrait of the Sultan in Frankish style. He committed his first crime to save his colleagues and their workshop as his victim was convinced that the book they were working on was to violate their religion, and was spreading those rumors. The second crime was because the workshop’s master Enishte insulted him, and insulted Master Osman when he forced them to mimic the works of Franks. So the crime was to save the workshop, and its style in both cases. The Persian miniaturists Olive felt that he will never attain the European talent, and that they need centuries to mimic their own excellence and this would make Ottomans the slaves of Europe. Thus, we read in the last chapters, after discovering the killer’s identity, “Precisely because you emulate the Franks, you will never attain individual style.”. In this story too, we read how homosexuality was something so frequent in the Orient, and the Ottoman empire, how Jews were facing discrimination despite being welcomed in Istanbul after their exile from Spain and Portugal. In the story, Esther, the Jewess street paddler, depicted in a stereotype of a person who is working for all and against all. She was forced to wear pink outfit, and fake stories on killing Christian children to be used for Jewish religions festivals was mentioned too. Slavery was mentioned too, and its market in Bayazid district. The novel is full of amazing descriptions of manuscripts in details, as well as lots of stories and legends on old master miniaturists, love stories of Shahs and Kings, and an Assyrian fable on death.. The philosophical discussions on death, art, devil, blindness, and life are so frequent too. The jealous brother, and the beloved mother is a common feature as well; this reminds us of Pamuk’s own experience. Describing the city in details, its weather, rain, snow, cypresses and buildings is one of Pamuk’s genuine styles.. I hate how people in those periods were looking to people from other religions; the word “infidel” was annoyingly frequent in the novel whenever describing Europeans. The Muslim preachers were even against showing tolerance to other religions and sects. Still, I enjoyed this novel too much, and until now I am unable to know whether Orhan Pamuk is with preserving the Ottoman Heritage or abandoning it; something so frequent in all his works. I think he himself is not able to decide and this might be his most pressing issue to discover and discuss.. Quotes:. Before my birth there was infinite time, and after my death, inexhaustible time. I never thought of it before: I had been living luminously between two eternities of darkness.. A face long not seen finally fades.. Dogs do speak, but only to those who know how to listen.. Painting is the silence of thought and the music of sight.. Immediately before the end of the world, there would also be such silence.. Those who can truly see, know.. Does love make one a fool or do only fools fall in love?. The larger and more colorful a city is, the more places there are to hide one’s guilt and sin; the more crowded it is, the more people there are to hide behind. A city’s intellect ought to be measured not by its scholars, libraries, miniaturists, calligraphers, and schools, but by the number of crimes insidiously committed on its dark streets over thousands of years. By this logic, doubtless, Istanbul is the world’s most intelligent city.. Only wealth, might, and legendary romances stir people’s curiosity. Everything else is but worry, separation, jealousy, loneliness, enmity, tears, gossip, and never-ending poverty.. The love all khans, shahs, and sultans feel for paintings, illustrations and fine books can be divided into three seasons; at first, they are bold, eager and curious. Rulers want paintings for the sake of respect, to influence how others see them. During this period, they educate themselves. During the second phase, they commission books to satisfy their own tastes. Because they have learned sincerely to enjoy paintings, they amass prestige while at the same time amassing books, which, after their deaths, ensure the persistence of their renown in this world. However, in the autumn of a sultan’s life, he no longer concerns himself with the persistence of his worldly immortality.. The birth of a new style is the result of years of disagreements, jealousies, rivalries, and studies in color and painting.. Indifference, time, and disaster will destroy our art.. Color is the touch of the eye, music to the deaf, a word out of darkness.. For men like myself, that is, melancholy men for whom love, agony, happiness, and misery are just excuses for maintaining eternal loneliness, life offers neither great joy nor great sadness.. Contrary to what is commonly believed, all murderers are men of extreme faith rather than unbelievers.. The beauty and mystery of this world only emerges through affection, attention, interaction and compassion.. Time does not flow if you do not dream.","Oct 11, 2015"
7486808,Anusha Jayaram,"I first picked this book up several years ago. I remember finding the narrative style odd, and the subject itself abstract and unintelligible. It was one of the very few books I stopped reading in the middle, simply because I realized I was getting nowhere with it. I decided, on a whim, to give it another try when I stumbled upon it again so many years later. And I'm glad I did.. I've realized yet again, that what a book means to you depends so much on who you are when you read the book. But I digress. Getting back to the book itself now... Turkey is one of the most fascinating places on earth - a multi-layered tapestry possessed of a rich and complex history, and a culture shaped by several different influences. A large part of this is owed to its geographic location. Situated at the point where East meets West, Turkey has long served as a gateway, and as a melting pot of cultures. Equally, it has also struggled constantly, existentially, to define its own identity, shape its own character.. Istanbul is quite literally a microcosm of all these forces, straddling the Bosphorus strait, belonging to both Europe and Asia at the same time.. It is this setting, this underlying generic theme that is necessary to relate to, as a reader, in order to fully immerse oneself in this book. Set in the late 16th century, the story takes us through the lives of master miniature painters in the workshop of the Ottoman Sultan Murat III. The plot itself deals with the murder of one of the master miniaturists, and unfolds through the eyes of multiple characters.. Pamuk uses this narrative device well - each chapter is narrated by a different individual, in their own voice, complete with their own self-interests in view. Pamuk does not repeat the same incidents through the eyes of multiple characters in Rashomon-esque style (which can be fascinating in its ability to toy with the reader's understanding of the 'absolute truth', by presenting multiple twists to the events that have transpired), instead choosing to move the story along at a faster pace. The chronology is linear, with each narrator picking up where the previous individual left off.. We do get to see plenty of manipulation in action, characters being wary of one another, sometimes with cause, sometimes without. What is also interesting is that each of the narrators pulls the reader into the story, addressing him / her directly, trying to ingratiate themselves with the reader. This could be due to the fact that this is a translated work from Turkic (although I may be wrong on this front), nevertheless this adds an interesting flavour to the book - knowing that characters are self-conscious, editing facts and events to portray themselves in a better light for the sake of the reader.. Another aspect of the multiple-narrator format that I found interesting is that, once in a while, there were unconventional characters picking up the thread of the story: a sketch of a horse, a tree, the devil, and red ink, among others.. As I read through each chapter, I couldn't help but look for 'clues' to who the murderer would turn out to be, sometimes revisiting previous chapters to corroborate or contradict events. But gradually, the question of who the murderer really was receded in its importance. I began to get absorbed in the lengthy monologues and debates between the characters, the philosophical and religious angst they struggled with. At their core, these debates are universal in theme and remain as relevant today as they were in 16th centiry Istanbul: human nature and ego, the struggle between individualism and the obligation to conform, and the various shades of interpretation and elasticity concerning any religious doctrine (and also the use of these 'rules' opportunistically, for personal benefit).. As for the characters themselves, they are so flawed, so real and compelling, that one is able to relate to them, even when they behave seemingly irrationally. Particularly interesting is the portrait (intentional use of the term here) of Shekure, in all her greyness. She proves herself to be an artful manipulator, seeking to maximize her benefit no matter the cost to others, while at at the same time remaining vulnerable in her unfortunate situation. Even after finishing the book, I couldn't quite make up my mind about how I felt about her!. Of course, there are some prerequisites to enjoying the book.. Perhaps the most important is that it would help immensely to have a broad understanding of the history and geography of all the places mentioned in the book prior to reading it. Part of this was accomplished by helpfully providing a map at the beginning of the book. I remember thinking several times while reading the book that I should brush up my history to understand some references better. After completing the book, however, I found a skeletal 'Chronology' of rulers and events at the back of the book. It would have been perfect if that had been transposed next to the map, right at the beginning of the book.. On a slightly less important note, the reader has to quickly get over the initial shock of seemingly accepted cultural norms of the time: master artists chasing after young and pretty boys, and describing their almond eyes and full red lips. Once the reader has sunk into that society, becoming a part of it, these references will seem less jarring.. Another aspect that I needed to get used to was the seemingly never-ending detail, once Pamuk launched into any description of book arts. It is as if he had opened an inexhaustible fount of masterpiece-names, and that he could not stop listing them out. The unending lists were difficult to focus on. Those, and the repetition of the tale of Shirin and Husrev scores of times throughout the book.. But it is ungrateful to enjoy a book so very much and dwell too much on its flaws, so I will stop with this here :). By the time the book concluded, I found myself not too concerned with the identity of the murderer, since the book had so much else to offer. I realized the revelation of the murderer didn't shock or excite me, as, perhaps it was never meant to. What I did enjoy is the last few lines by Shekure.. *Spoiler alert*. When Shekure reveals that she had shared all her letters with her son, Orhan, and that he is the narrator of this story, the reader realizes that Orhan's own biases would have been an inseparable part of the narration, adding another layer to the already colourful story.. *End of Spoiler*. There is also a piece of trivia that I came across after finishing the book, that I found very endearing: in the book, Shekure's younger son's name is Orhan. And the older son's name is Shevket. This also happens to be the name of Orhan Pamuk's elder brother in real life. That just made me smile.","Dec 26, 2016"
49498312,Philippa,"3.5 stars. I’ve never both liked and disliked a book so much at the same time.. The theme of art and illustration and how it was seen at the time of the novel was fascinating. Imagine what it must be like having never seen ‘life-like’ art or portraits! And imagine the philosophical and theological questions that a change in centuries long traditions of art would evoke. The characters are plagued by these questions and we see them with the context they have to the characters lives - which is a truly novel, inspiring way to tell this story. I’m in awe.. But at the same time, my god, some chapters were painfully boring. The repetition of thoughts we’ve already heard from other characters and the half page descriptions of the scene (which often read like a list) became tedious. I wonder if this was a reflection of the theme around illustrating objects to accompany a narrative? Either way I struggled to get through some parts.. The murder investigation plot of the story didn’t really engage me at all. I wasn’t particularly interested in finding out who the murder was and their reasons for doing it. I found the murderer suspects dialogue some of the least enjoyable chapters to read and was often confused about how I was supposed to feel towards them.. My favorite character by far was the shrewd and endearing Shekure. I very much enjoyed the portrayal of the challenges of womanhood in Istanbul in the 16th century through her and also Esther, the clothier.. I’m not sure if there is supposed to be criticism of Islam in this novel. It appears that way at times when some chapters seen sarcastic, but I need to read more about Orhan Pamuk and his outlook.. I’m left with lots of questions but I can’t bring myself to go back and read through this again. It’s probably my loss - but jeez some this felt like a tome of a book!","Nov 04, 2018"
79416586,Florina Mocanu,"If you want to travel to some times not many know of, then reading 'My Name is Red' must be a priority.. Telling you about this book will not be easy, as this is an enormous literary work with so many characters and with a story that transcends its pages.. The main characters in the novel are the miniaturists in the Ottoman Empire: Black, Butterfly, Stork, Olive and Elegant. The book begins with the murder of the later. From this point we begin the story of the Westernization of the Ottoman pictorial art and how the artists either embrace it or they fought against it.. Each chapter of the novel has a different narrator, although the story is progressing naturally. Not only people are narrating, but also a coin, a corpse, Satan, two dervishes and even the color red. The novel touches not only on the Istanbul's history but also on the romance between Black and Shekure, between Butterfly and Olive and it also touches on the role of the woman in this period.. Enishte Effendi, the maternal uncle of Black and Shekure's father, is one of the supporters of the Western art and he tricks his disciples into creating nontraditional miniatures. Half way though, however someone murders him too. At this point, Pamuk is explaining how the Ottoman artists were supposed to render what God wanted them to and their passion and willingness to show us, the mortals, was frowned upon. Black is the one explaining it the best: 'Pictures are forbidden by our faith. Because the illustrations of the Persian masters and even the masterpieces of the greatest masters of Herat are ultimately seen as an extension of border ornamentation, no one would take issue with them, reasoning that they enhanced the beauty of writing and the magnificence of calligraphy.'. However, no matter how much one fights change in the end people will always want it.","May 05, 2020"
8435595,Jamie,"Though I'm still untangling all the intertextual references, I enjoyed the mix of voices in this novel. The whole mystery premise and the obvious amount of attention paid to history, the arts, and belief leads me to compare it to Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose in some respects. The opening chapter in which the corpse of the murdered man speaks directly to the reader was a great hook and entry into an increasingly intricate story. I think the mix of voices is what really makes the work unique, especially when all kinds of inanimate things begin to speak more directly on the philosophies and tensions that guide the characters and as someone not an expert on Turkish art or history, a good place to start looking up or be introduced to some key traits of Turkish culture (there's a lot about art styles that come to Istanbul from around the world) and the stories that are referenced repeatedly throughout. Though you have to be ready to really sit with this novel as it's over 400 pages long and it can take a moment to remember who is speaking as everything is in first person and rather philosophical, it never really struck me as inaccessible. I didn't sit with Wikipedia or any other resource on Turkey or art next to me while I read, though I did flag and takes notes a lot expecting to review all I'd read when I finished. All in all, a very thought provoking book about art and Istanbul's place between east and west. Recommended, especially to those more philosophically inclined as I wouldn't necessarily call it light reading (but I'm sure if you're just in it for the romance and murder mystery aspects, you'll still find something enjoyable in trying to decide which voice belongs to a murderer).","May 18, 2018"
11772351,David Kent,"An extraordinarily complex narrative revolving around the murder of an illuminator, one of several artists who have been hard at work illuminating (illustrating) the Sultan's new book, a book that perhaps isn't what the Sultan expects. Orhan Pamuk is a Turkish writer who later won the Nobel Prize in Literature.. The book begins with a chapter called ""I am a corpse,"" written from the point of view of a man who has just been murdered. All the chapters are written from the points of view of the individual characters. ""I am called Black"" introduces Black, returning from a 12-year exile to woo his long-lost love. ""I, Shekure,"" that long-lost love, is however waiting for her husband to return from the wars, knowing inside he is likely dead. Her two children, one of whom is named Orhan, which plays into the story at the end, have ambiguous feelings for Black. Then there is Hasan, the husband's brother, himself in love with the beautiful Shekure. Add in repeating chapters ""I am called...Butterfly/Stork/Olive,"" the nicknames given by ""Master Osman"" to the three remaining illuminators, one of whom is likely the murderer. Since the illuminations themselves take on an important role, there are chapters from their points of view in ""I am a...a Dog/a Tree/a Gold Coin/a Horse."" And let's not forget ""I am Esther,"" a clothier-slash-matchmaker delivering messages between the star-crossed lovers.. All of this overlays incredible insights into Muslim culture, history, and views on art. Should the illuminations represent the viewpoint of God, or of the artists originality; a tension that drives much of the narrative beyond whether Shekure and Black will ever be together. These insights raise the book from merely a story to an epic exploration of a culture that very few Americans are familiar.","Jul 31, 2018"
3084169,Ali علی ,"This book reminded me of Tolstoy's War and Peace which may sound ludicrous to some, but here are some reasons why:. * both books are historical fictions based on actual historical events.. * both authors have done lots of background hitorical research for the novels, even though Pamuk's book is based on much distant era, and hence his efforts are more impressive in this regard.. * Tolstoy's book weaves the narrative with recurring reflections on history, philosophy of history etc., In Pamuk's account reflections on history are replaced by reflections on the nature of painting and art.. * both books deal with the issue of religion, modernity etc.. * In both books actual stories are not complex, nor are reflections, even though Pamuk's poetic prose is able to avoid monotony. It does help that Pamuk's book is much shorter. Also, the complexity of Pamuk's narrating style to a large extent compensates for the simplicity of the story.. Translation is excellent ( and I can say this even without ever reading the original). The only major problem I had was the term 'sect' , as in Shafi sect, which doesn't make sense, because Shafi is a legal school of thought and not a sect by any standards. I'm not sure what was the original term used, but regardless this is a misleading rendition. More minor problem was with using Turkish rendition of non Turkish names, for e.g. Husro for Khusro.. Note: I'm fairly at home with the cultural, historical and literary references and background of the story so I'm not sure how someone without the background will like the book.","Sep 18, 2020"
4072019,Namita Jagannath,"​'What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.'. Orhan delivers again! I love the writing, the choice of words, the characters, the detailing...it's almost as if you're watching a movie. He surely knows how to paint a picture. I marvel at how good the original must be, if the translation is such a lovely rendition. I generally do not enjoy a novel with too many narrators​; ​but this one I did. Every chapter, title, sentence and thought is so well thought through...almost perfect! If there is anything called 'perfect.' The book deals so beautifully with its complex themes - love, murder, influence of art and religion, etc. Very few authors have the ability wherein you read a sentence, or a thought and you want to stop - let it sink in and you marvel at the magic of words.. But in all honesty, in my opinion there are points in the book wherein some chapters wander off into too much detail about the Ottoman Empire and the ​​miniaturist art and its influences in the 16th century. Other than this, I ideally want one and all to read this. Such is my joy with this book, that I want all my reader friends to enjoy it as well. People looking for a page-turner/thriller should stay away. People looking for good literature - hurry! This is a good read and one for the shelf as well.","Apr 15, 2018"
22218283,Sonal,"I so much wanted to like this book. When I started it, I was so excited. Historical fiction on the Ottoman empire with a murder mystery, a love affair, art and artists in the galore. It was supposed to be a feast. But this one was definitely not for me. It was tedious, I dragged through the pages and literally had to put in an effort to finish it off.. I understand why this book is a classic and I did learn quite a lot about the traditional illustrative Islamic arts. Islam forbids idol-worshipping, so portraits and true representation of the living is considered heresy. But an artist after his travel to Venice and beholding European representative art, get inspired to illustrate his Sultan true to his likeness. Although commissioned by the Sultan himself, this doesn't go well with the old thinkers.. The premise is actually interesting but the story is not even one-fourth of the book. Rest is the ramblings of the artists and description of several illustrations and respective short stories, with no relation to the actual plot. I being unfamiliar with the Turkish folklore, these folk tales are not always complete and since unrelated it kind of gets distracting after a point. I started looking for bits and pieces of the main story between the pages. I was there for the story and not philosophy, maybe that is why I didn't really enjoy it like the others.","Jul 19, 2020"

56337123,Georgina Kelly,"what an superb book. set in the late 17th century Ottoman Empire this is a book of sultans and shas, believers and infidels, folklore and fables among the years of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. as influences from Western provinces (such as Venice grow and spread throughout the Islamic world conflicts around meaning in the visual arts are the context for the love/crime story in the foreground. But it is by far the clash of philosophies around what is fit and not fit to be represented, what does and does not violate the singularity that is Allah, the loss of one world to another that absorbed me utterly. The grief of those either struggling to protect the practices of the old Turkish masters whose work complied with religious strictures, those who were attracted to the Western ""stuyle"" which involved the individual ego and was often considered idolatrous, and then the eventual fall of the visual art world completely as Islam became more rigid and illustration fell out of favour entirely. the language is luscious and the format innovative. we hear the voices of a picture of a tree, the colour red, the spectre of death, as well as all the characters involved in the novel. this novel could also have been called ""my name is perspective"" and is an examination of the many angles of perspective both literally and figuratively. what the eye observes, how the individual mind co-creates the thing ""seen""according to individual and cultural memory and desire. this is a lusciously written novel and rich with ideas. one of my favourite novels this year.","Apr 07, 2018"
27237533,can y,"Yahya Kemal Bayatlı, one of Turkey's most renowned poets, once famously declared that Turks ""would have been a completely different people, had they proper examples of prose and painting"".. Consciously or not, Pamuk's ""My Name is Red"" is a response to Bayatlı. The book is about a murder mystery among miniaturists, masters of Oriental painting. Miniature is an attempt at ""showing the world as God sees it from above the clouds"", and the way Pamuk weaves in the story from multiple perspectives, with an apparently omniscient viewer looking at the story is not much different from what the old masters of miniature were up to. A single linear perspective throughout the prose as is done in the West, is not employed in the book, instead replaced with plurality. Throughout the book, the tension between Western art and Eastern art, builds up to the book Enişte's crafting for the Sultan. As master Osman looks at the book, he identifies the pictures inside as neither Western nor Eastern, but a confused mixture of both (and is this not what Pamuk suggests Turkish society is?).. Had the old masters of miniature written novels in the way they paint, I bet it would look similar to ""My Name is Red."" Masterful.","Jul 23, 2018"
50946522,Shifad,"This is my first Orhan Pamuk and it will take sometime getting used to. The entire background of the story and Turkish culture, folklore and the Heroes were unfamiliar to me. At times I felt I was beleaguered by notions and ideas foreign to me. Needless to say, the initial few pages took me sometime to get used to. There is also a poetic quality in his writing. Eventhough the major plot in the story is a murder, the book also discusses a wide variety of philosphies. The book is told in the view point of different persons and each chapter is different from one another. This book discusses a wide variety of human emotions, many social issues at the time. The whole book is set against the backdrop of miniaturisation and illustration. The impact of western style painting on the eastern way of painting and its conflux is depicted in the story. This book may feel like a drag in the first few pages. This can be attributed to the historical and islamic theological trivia that the author entwines with the plot. Needless to say, this book is a complex piece if literature. It will certainly demand your whole attention or you will get derailed.","Mar 15, 2018"
21047992,Büşra,"Orhan Pamuk is a well known author in my country, so right after Pamuk won the Nobel Prize for Literature I meant to read this book. However I only now had the chance to read this one. I also study Turkish history, so this is a period more than familiar to me. However, I wish I could avoid rating this novel. My Name is Red was such a difficult book to follow. I imagine it is not easily accessible intellectually either. I can also imagine the common reader who has absolutely no knowledge of the 16th century İstanbul thinking “Sir Pamuk, what are you trying to say?”. It has a somehow gripping beginning, then right when you think you are engaged with the story, you get lost in the heavy waves of details he provided on the historical aspects of art. Eventually, it drags on and on and on. The narrative in this book shifts from person to person to objects and back again. It is not easy at all to follow all the shifts. I know it has heavy literary worth, hence the 3 stars, but it just wasn't for me.","Jan 29, 2020"
40993737,Muhammad Arif,"Honestly speaking, I mistook this beautifully written novel for a wholesome journey into Muslim architecture and painting, for it gives us such a unique insight into the nuances of orthodox and modern views of Muslim painters and miniaturists, taking cues from the glorious Quran in the defense of paintings that: “it is indeed important that a painting, through its beauty summon us toward life’s abundance, toward compassion, toward respect for the colors of the realm which God created, and toward reflection and faith. The identity of the miniaturist isn’t important.” Without any doubt, ‘painting and happiness are the genesis of our true world and painting is a wonderful feast for the eyes.’. This book can enhance the warped understanding of Muslims about painting and miniaturists and the beauty and mystery of this world can only be found when they open their eyes wide and actually see this world by attending to its colors and details.","Aug 19, 2020"
35973717,Revanth Ukkalam,"Pamuk's novel is locked in time and fixed in its context: a place where living is mandated by work and work by faith. It is an era of globalisation of art: the Chinese, Indians, Persians, Mongols, and Turks learn freely from each other but the most dreaded are the Venetians with their humanist paintings. It is an age where 'There is no God but God and Muhammad is his prophet'. Elegant Enishte is murdered in that world. The history of Turkey and the crossroads of Asia and Europe have a deep imprint on his death. The novel echoes Firdausi and Nizami. Leyla-Mujnun, and Shirin-Khusrau resonate in the love that Pamuk pens. Orhan Pamuk has inherited the best qualities of post-modernism and historical fiction in writing this.","Feb 20, 2018"
18534820,William Tracy,"This is an incredibly interesting book. Each chapter is from one of many POVs, including a dead man, a painting of a horse, a painting of a tree (!), 7 or 8 characters, and the murderer. The story takes a bit to get going, especially to get all the characters straight. There are connections between them that only come to light later on. The story itself is set in the 16th century Ottoman empire, and is concerned with the murder of a painter (miniaturist) working on a new book for the sultan.. On the downside, I would say the characters are a bit flat, and the main characters (if they can be called that) are not particularly likable. However, I would recommend this simply for the artistry of how it is written, and for the view into a culture we don't usually see in the USA.","Feb 08, 2019"
50990083,Shatha Qaiwer,"My Name is Red. Starting as an author to whom the reader is cognitively attached, to a minor character in the novel and finally stated as the future author to pen the story narrated presently, Pamuk has smartly and elegantly achieved the unity of the event in the real world with the story world taking the reader nicely to the future and back to the present. An additional string of unity is achieved through depicting the color red; red for love, red for lust (master Osman and the miniaturists; Hayriye and Enshite, Hasan and Shekure), red for hate and envy (Young miniaturists, Hayriye and Shekure), red for death (Olive’s doubled character as a killer and a pious person whose action of killing devoted for Allah). This string is connected other representations of the colour narrated by the personified dog, tree, coin, death which starts at the very beginning with corpse covered with blood. Red in the novel signifies the mixture of lust, desire, hatred and jealousy on the negative side and love on the plus side centred on Shekure (Black, her children, Enishte) making her character a nucleus of the events.. Skekure’s character reflects significantly what we can describe as the bright and dark part of Women’s nature. She seeks marriage for living and securing her children, i.e she was seeking security she could not find at her in-laws. Her intentions are sincerely revealed in the plan she arranged to marry Black. She set her condition prior to sharing bed including revealing the identity of her father’s murderer, and completing his book. Listening to her plot, Black admires her beauty which she comprehended as praise for her intelligence which she used to hear her father praising and starts weeping:. ‘As I cried, it was as if I’d left myself and was becoming another, entirely separate woman. Like some reader troubled by a sad picture in the pages of a book, I saw life from the outside and pitied what I saw. There’s something so innocent in crying over one’s troubles, as though they were another’s …’ CH 32. Even during her first intimate contact with Black’s wounded body, she was not too much into it as she commented with the World in her mouth, all that amused her was ‘the twittering of my sons cursing and roughhousing with each other in the courtyard’. In return to her love, Black’s feeling were strongly self- denying ones. Though ware of what she is after, he proceeds in implementing her plan and seeks to be a good father to her children basically for her sake. The way he responds to Shvket’s accusation of killing his Enishte, Black’s reply was not a yes/ no answer instead he thought how that accusation might be upsetting Shekure ‘ if you are going to upset your mother, do not expect any affection from me.’ He cares so much to treat them kindly but when it came to hurting his beloved he proceeded ‘we did not shout at each other like a stepfather and stepson, but like two men talking by the banks of a loud rushing river (Ch 36).. It seems that Pamuk uses his characters to narrate and teach history, a feature I identified in some eastern novels. The text is loaded with historical information which I do not really value as I read novels to learn about life and people but YES my future destination can include other works written by Orhan Pamuk.","Nov 11, 2019"
5539620,Dorum,"I really enjoyed this book.. First of all it is written in a very interesting manner. It keeps one interested and gripped to the story. So from a technical point of view it is quite good.. Also, I like the world it describes. It is exotic. The story makes it interesting, even though it is so remote and different from my common experience.. However, these points, while good for a 3-4 star novel don't make it a 5-star novel. The reason why I believe this is a 5-star novel is because of the gripping and extremely detailed analysis and contrast of aesthetic values in the Orient and in the Occident.. The world of the miniaturists is used only as a pretext to describe how the world East and the West see things like beauty and value in completely different manner. And also why.","Nov 21, 2019"

Some chapters are narrated by unusual characters, such as a dead man, the drawing of a dog, the drawing of a tree, and a coin. One problem I had with the book was that several of the characters were damn irritating without any redeeming features, and they weren't even the antagonists!. And then there was all that damn commentary on the nature of visual art. It seemed so pretentious, so ambiguous, that I have to wonder if this was satire! It seemed so stupid, so empty.

Just like the faces in Persian miniatures, the authors of each chapter are both enmeshed with each other and looking out to the reader as a judge or admirer.

I learned heaps about the influence of Venetian style and perspective on Ottoman art, which really serves as the basis of the entire plot.. But because there was such focus on painting as an art form, I did find it difficult to become wholly invested in the characters themselves, and in doing so, felt as though the tension building in the plot often fell flat. And as interested as I was in all of the philosophy of art, it made the novel a dense read, one I couldn’t just pick up and spend 10 mins with on my morning commute..

It took me around 2 months or more to read this book, but it was worth the time spent. Though it’s a thick book, it never bored me or made me tired, as every chapter was narrated by a different character, reading the same story from different points of view was really interesting to me. Moreover the author surprises you in every couple of chapters by coming up with something brilliant and new; such as an unpredictable event, a new character or revelation of a mystery. In my opinion what makes this book special is the proficiency of the author in characterization, not only main human characters like Black Effendi, Shekure, Eshter, Enishte Effendi and... have their very special and different features but also things! Some chapters are narrated by things like a coin, a painting, or even a color!. I highly recommend “My Name is Red” to those who take joy in reading tales like “One Thousand and One Night”.

1551688,Brian,"Istanbul, 16th century:. ""What could be more exquisite than looking at the world's most beautiful pictures while trying to recollect God's vision of the world?"". A miniaturist is murdered, and from the bottom of a well, his corpse begins the story of My Name is Red. A different narrator in each chapter presents this tale of mystery, romance and pride. There's even a chapter told by a coin, a dog, Satan, a horse, and the color red.. My Name is Red presents a history of 16th Ottoman painting and its position in the Muslim world. With master miniaturists returning from travels to western countries, they brought back with them the visual memory of a controversial style of painting, realism, paintings using shadows and perspective to create a true likeness of a subject. To the faithful, painting in this style is an unpardonable sin. Placing a true likeness of a subject in the center of a page, taking art away from the margins of books, adding perspective that may entail painting other objects, even a dog or Satan, bigger than the Sultan was considered blasphemy. This type of painting veered away from the way God envisioned the world. And by placing a subject in the center of the page gave undue importance to that image potentially creating a vision that fostered idolatry. Only pride and the belief that one was greater than Allah would create such a thing.. Kuala Lumpur, 21st century:. I learned about such things early in my career here. I learned that I could not design a sculpture in the likeness of a human or animal, even in abstract form. But like during the Ottoman period the strict guidelines, the unwavering laws that governed artists, billowed slightly in the western cultural wind allowing interpretations to creep into the rigid artistic belief system. Sculpting insects became permissible.. As I write this I think about how I've completely tuned out the call to prayers from the National Mosque located near my home but recall seeing children cry in fear when walking near the loud speakers billowing sermons near the grocery store. In the papers this week there were articles about how the Syariah High Court now allows a Muslim convert to renounce Islam and go back to their former religion, a landmark ruling; apostasy is still illegal for Muslims born into the faith. A blogger was jailed under the Sedition Act for calling certain officials 'dogs' and 'pigs', a tremendous insult due to the status of these two forbidden animals within the Muslim world. The word 'Allah' has been ruled strictly a Muslim word and no other religion may print it in their publications; the Catholic Church is currently in court over this ruling. And every Sultan, prime minister and minister has a portrait painted of them in the style of the West; a portrait that uses perspective, shadow and color to create a true likeness, a potential idol.. But there's something more about this book that I can't quite put into words. Though the Istanbul painted by Pamuk was mostly bleak. The fears when a believer feels he's dishonored the Great Prophet, the Sultan, or his Master were brush stokes that created an oppressive picture. But the freedom of individual spirit as witnessed in the coffee house carousing and story telling that bordered on the blasphemous and the power of pride that oft times grew stronger than the fear of diminishing faith illustrated the strength and the power of the individual, the uncontrollable freedom of expression. These opposing images were illuminated throughout the book. And when I turned the last page, my faith in God was greater.. Pamuk also has a sense of humor. Here's an excerpt of the chapter as told by a gold coin:. ""I once left Istanbul in the purse of a preacher from Edirne who was going to Manisa. ON the way, we happened to be attacked by thieves. One of them shouted, ""Your money or your life!"" Panicking, the miserable preacher hid us in his asshole. This spot, which he assumed was the safest, smelled worse than the mouth of the garlic love and was much less comfortable. But the situation quickly grew worse when instead of ""Your money or you life!"" the thieves began to shout ""Your honor or your life!"" Lining up, they took him by turns. I don't dare describe the agony we suffered in that cramped hole. It's for this reason that I dislike leaving Istanbul."". And as a final note… I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a tinge of worry or hesitation when hitting the 'Post Reply' button. Not a concern stemming from my pride. Nor a worry of blasphemy. But a fear of how certain words or phrases I laid down may be interpreted by those in whose country I am a guest, those who I believe through their pride are convinced that their interpretation of the Koran is the only true interpretation. That is the state of some places in the 21st century, a state similar to Istanbul of the 16th century.. Read this book. It is good.","Nov 10, 2008"

9502617,Syed M. Abdullah,"I have felt throughout the novel that the translation into English (from Turkish) has somehow compromised its otherwise strong message (if there is any), though I haven’t read the original as much as i’d like to. Secondly, at some points i have felt that the author has unnecessarily digressed from the original storyline or subject matter, which ends up creating more often than not a significant intellectual boredom. If the original version feels as weak as this, i’d even be justified in criticising the award of nobel prize to the author. In short, if one has abundant free time and wants to waste it somewhere, this is a good venture.","Oct 06, 2017"

3941555,Carlos,"This book was just marvelous. I didn’t quite remember how it got on my list so I started it completely without expectations and was immediately bought over by its style. Pamuk’s decision to start the novel from the point of view of a murdered man was just brilliant. He immediately captures the reader’s attention and prepares them to the innovative way in which he tells his story. Along the way the intermingling of artistic ruminations, Ottoman history and a good murder mystery serve to make this novel completely captivating. While Pamuk’s decision to frame his story, and philosophical musings, around a murder mystery reminded me of Umberto Eco’s “The Name of the Rose”, his penchant for humor, his unapologetic approach to sex and his willingness to use unique points of view gave the book a unique and pleasant style.","Apr 14, 2018"
